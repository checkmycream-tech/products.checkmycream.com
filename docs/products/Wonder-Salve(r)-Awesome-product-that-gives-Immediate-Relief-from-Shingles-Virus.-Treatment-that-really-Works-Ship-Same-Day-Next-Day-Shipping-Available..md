<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s doing a great job! I had third degree burn above my ankle.Put pure honey many years ago. Very little scaring! That&#x27;s why I bought it. Will be ordering another!</li>
    <li> This stuff works magical  wonders...........have used it for years for just about anything...in healing .........Anyone should try it to see it&#x27;s value</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF IS GREAT FOR SHINGLES, PAIN, ETC.. AND I WILL SAVE AND USE IT MANY TIMES, I AM SURE...&lt;br /&gt;IT CAN HELP WITH MANY SKIN ABRASIONS, ALSO..</li>
    <li> My wife occasionally suffers from shingles and in researching for anything to relieve her pain I found Wonder Salve. I purchased it for her and because she was in so much pain I had it shipped overnite. We got the product straight away and my wife began using it. Instantly her pain was reduced and within a very short time the shingles were gone and all the while her pain was deminished. Anyone who suffers from shingles knows how painful they are.   A few months later a friend said he had blisters on his face, they were extremely painful and a doctor had given him a perscription, but wasn&#x27;t sure what it was. I immediately bought him some Wonder Salve, he used it and his pain and sores went away very quickly as well.  Not too long after that my Mother said she was having problems with shingles and right away I ordered her some Wonder Salve and she loves it. So Durham&#x27;s Wonder Salve has made me a hero and my Mom, my wife and a friend very happy.  It also works great on fever blisters. I get them when I&#x27;m out in the sun without protection. I had one coming on one day and thought I&#x27;ld give Wonder Salve a shot and it works better than any topical I&#x27;ve ever tried. No nasty sore on your lip or anything, just keep applying until it&#x27;s gone.  Very seldom do I write reviews, but Wonder Salve is really a great product and worth the time and effort.   If you suffer from shingles you must give Wonder Salve a try, you&#x27;ll be very happy you did.</li>
    <li> I use test strips 3-4 times a day and massage &#x27;Wonder Salve&#x27; in my fingertips nightly....no pain and no stick marks!  Has also made my nails stronger.  Can&#x27;t do without this.....</li>
    <li> My husband has pancreatic cancer and his time is limited.  He was given three months and has now survived 11 months.  He got shingles on top of all this and the pain was so bad he wondered how he would manage.  Every suggestion from the doctors was ineffective.  We have tubes and jars of useless cremes and lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this miracle product on line.  I ordered it for over night.  The itching, and the pain began to lessen with every application.  The rash and sores are healing much quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To deal with shingles while dealing with the inevitable progression of his horrible disease was just too much.  The wonder salve was a miracle to us.</li>
    <li> My wife has Multiple Myaloma Cancer. The treatments she is going through has left her defenceless aginst infections of all kinds, as a result she has contracted Shingles.  I read the positive posts on this website and decided to take a chance.  I ordered the smallest amount available the 1 oz size. The results have been great.  My wife felt relief almost immediately.  About 20 seconds after she first applied the salve she comented to me that this stuff works alot better than the hydocortazone cream she had been using.  I am in the insurance business and I have already recommended the salve to one of my customers.  I would like to buy stock in the company.  Does any one know if this is a publicly traded company?  If so let me know on the customer comment area.  Good Luck.</li>
    <li> This could be an absolutely wonderful natural answer for some people. I was disappointed that I was unable to really reap the benefit, not due to the product... but due to the fact that I don&#x27;t react well to honey or honey based products, which I had to find out the hard way.  To ANYONE who is able to tolerate honey and foods/products made with honey... it will more than likely work for you. Give it a try. The company (people) are great... :)</li>
    <li> My wife was using this for some relief from shingles. For her it had no positive (or negative) effect.  It stains clothing, so even if it is effective for you, be careful what you wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was relatively expensive, the jar is small....With shingles, you become desperate for some relief, and I was hoping this worked...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was packaged well, arrived in a timely manner, but had no positive remedial effect for my Wife&#x27;s shingles.</li>
    <li> Hi I  was haveing pain and burning in my hip a leg for 4 days went to Dr they thought it was bursitis but 3 day put me on IB Profin which did nothing  3 days later I am in much worse pain and now have a rash now they tell me its shingles . which i have had in the past about 11 years ago i missed alot of work back then , so this time I am on antibotics and pain meds. for three days and they don&#x27;t seem to be working so  I decided to look for my self I found this product , I don&#x27;t usally order like this but i took a big chance i order it thursday night spent extra to get it the next day . WOW What a wonderful $ 38.93 I ever spent I would say this about WONDER-SALVE  Product wow it is great i will be telling everyone . I tryed it as soon as I got it put on the burning and ichy and pain  was gone i  don&#x27;t tolerate pain so for me to say this this product is wonderful it is . Thanks Durham&#x27;s Bee farm and thanks Wonder Bee&#x27;s  I will order again when needed also I will be telling my DR about this product .  My shingles are not gone as that takes awhile but i don&#x27;t even know that i have them when useing this wonderful product so , to all reading this take a chance as I did its well worth it .I would do it all over I am never so happy that I did . Thanks Durham&#x27;s Bee farm and Amazon for this great product and fast service and shipping and well  clean package and not riped or damaged. recieved it fast and on time . Don&#x27;t beleive it when people  say it doesn&#x27;t work just try it . my husband was tired of listen to me cry in pain it works . DANNA B</li>
    <li> I only wish I had found this earlier! I use wonder salve primarily for eczema and chapped lips, but have also put it on scrapes and burns and bites...I don&#x27;t go anywhere without it. Even though I use it frequently, it lasts a long time. It doesn&#x27;t work as quickly as hydrocortisone on my eczema, but it is natural and doesn&#x27;t have side-effects with long-term use.     Propolis does have a peculiar smell, but I got used to it and don&#x27;t mind it now. I ordered this after discovering Durham&#x27;s Canker Rid, which is the only product I have ever found that heals my canker sores and doesn&#x27;t just numb them. A+ product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s gotten rid of two skin cancers on my arm so far.  Saved me a trip to the dermatologist. They turned scabby, scab fell off, red, then completely healed up in a week to 10 days. I don&#x27;t know why people keep saying it stains clothes, unless they put a boatload on and didn&#x27;t rub it in.  I put a tiny dab on, rub it in for a few seconds, then get dressed (even long sleeves) as usual.</li>
    <li> Arrived far sooner than expected and was exactly as promised.</li>
    <li> Having heard that nothing will help with the pain from shingles, I was very skeptical about any product claiming to give relief.  After reading the reviews, I decided to take a chance and order some Wonder Salve for my father.  True to the product claims, he said the pain relief is immediate and long lasting.  Apparently it is working better than anything else he has tried, including prescription medications.  Update: The Wonder Salve does not work (for him) on new outbreaks.  It continues to work on dry areas.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this wonderful product! It truly is my go-to for everything now. I have PCOS and get very bad hormonal acne which the RX cream I have no longer even works but this salve does! This salve solves everything! I can not say enough positive things about it.</li>
    <li> I was swayed by the positive reviews here, but as soon as I opened the jar I regretted this purchase. The stuff is greasy and brown -- how yukky can you get? It&#x27;s hard to imagine WHERE on the body I would want to put this. I did try it on a sore -- with a tissue over it to keep the salve from ruining my pants -- but didn&#x27;t notice any improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total waste of money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think of how you&#x27;d cover this to keep from ruining your clothes (or objects you touch) before investing in it.</li>
    <li> Not useful as it stated. Please dont trust on this product.</li>
    <li> The salve had no effect on my Shingles and it was very unpleasant to use since it did not dry very rapidly and remained sticky for quite a period of time.</li>
    <li> The Wonder Salve is so awesome!  I have a little spot on the inside of my forearm that I had to have a biopsy on.  The nurse told me to put some Neosporin on it every day, and keep a bandage on it.  Well I did, and it wasn&#x27;t healing very well.... In fact it&#x27;s been taking too long, and it itched really bad.  So I said I&#x27;ll try the Wonder Salve and OMG!  It is healing so much better and faster!  I always put it on little cuts, and other little areas that happen to come along... even burns!  I burned myself really bad on the oven... I put the Wonder Salve on it, and it took the burn out within 30 minutes, and within 2-3 days, the blister was gone!  I was so happy!  Can&#x27;t live without it!  Thank you,  Susan P.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my shingles but shingles was so light------I did not have to use!  Was really blessed!</li>
    <li> I saw your advertisement that said it would relieve the itching from shingles, it does not, shame on you for false advertising and giving me hope to relieve this itching.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and have become more prone to boils in the last few years. A friend of mine who suffers from shingles recommended Wonder Salve and I thought I&#x27;d give it a try, after reading the list of natural ingredients.     After applying the salve on an angry boil a couple of nights ago, I could feel it gradually reduce in size over the next 12 hours or so. I have tried so many other balms/sprays/creams to no avail (I&#x27;ve even tried taking turmeric and now the sight of curry turns my stomach), that I went to bed thinking the relief I felt was probably all in my head. Imagine my shock when I finally realized in the next evening that I had gone through the entire day without being distracted by the boil, and that I didn&#x27;t think once about it because I wasn&#x27;t in pain.     Perhaps it was a coincidence, and the next boil will not respond as obligingly to the salve. But given this experience, I will definitely keep the salve in my arsenal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review before, but I felt I HAD to for this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Golden Retriever was treated with radiation therapy under his lower jaw and he suffered severe burns.  I was told not to put anything on the burns during his treatments, but I would be able to once the treatments were completed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After researching, and reading the reviews for Wonder-Salve, I decided to give it a try.  I applied a thick coating to the area one evening, and woke up the next morning to find a HUGE improvement ... I continued to apply the salve for a few more days, and by the 4th day his radiation burns had just about vanished.  His vets were astonished at how quickly he healed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I was able to post pictures here just to demonstrate the improvement that occurred in just a matter of 4 days !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonder-Salve has been appropriately named!!!!</li>
    <li> not so good for shingles, did not help the pain.  over the counter Bengay did the job.</li>
    <li> This product had so many glowing reviews that I was a bit skeptical about trying it, because I have not had much relief from other products that are supposed to relieve shingles post herpetic pain, blisters and itching. That said, I was still willing to try it. I suffer from occasional shingles outbreaks, despite having gotten the vaccination for it. Recently, I started to get an outbreak, and I thought uh-oh, here we go, let me try this Wonder Salve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is that it worked almost instantly providing immediate relief, and stopped the outbreak before it had a chance to fully develop. I was so amazed I really had a hard time believing that it was working so well. But after a few hours, when the blister (that subsided) didn&#x27;t reappear, I knew it had worked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Durham&#x27;s Bee Farm, and count me among the users that are truly impressed with your product!</li>
    <li> Durham Bee Farm&#x27;s Wonder Salve has proven to be one of the few things, if not the only thing, that have given my grandfather relief from the unholy pain and irritation associated with the Shingles Virus. The pain manifests itself in his face and the top of his head. It is an unbearable burden for a man who has suffered one malady or another for most of his life and never complained to his family. He has tried shots, creams, salves, pills, patches, voodoo, and exorcism, yet nothing has compared to the relief obtained from Wonder Salve. This product is definitely worth trying (especially for the price) and just might give you the relief that you have so desperately been searching for.

    <li> Good product but it does stain your clothes (which they warn you on the jar).  I don&#x27;t know it if really gives relief as the Shingles are so painful but I felt that putting it on had to help in some way.  I would use it again.</li>
    <li> All i can say is &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34;!  this stuff really works.  i am a 51 year old male who never gets sick, blessed for sure!  Well i came down with the shingles after self diagnosis.  I decided to buy the 1oz Wonder Salve and try it out after all the research i had done on shingles.  i did not go to the doctor, because my research says the virus has to run its course &amp; there really is no cure.  all you can do is treat the rash with creams and take pain meds the docs prescribe. A week later i purchased this and the next day the results were visible,  it has been a week since i began using the salve and the rash is gone showing little signs of scaring which will fade with time.  I used the salve liberally as suggested,  be sure to wear an old tee-shirt (soft) because it does stain.  I would also recommend purchasing the 4oz wonder salve since the 1oz only lasted me a week.  it&#x27;s been 8 days since i began using the salve, the rash is gone, some pain still exist but i feel certain it too will subside with time.  the pain feels like electric shocks thru the surface of the skin where the rash was.  This stuff is Wondurhamful…..</li>
    <li> About ten days ago I started to feel the burning and pain feeling on my left leg...so I called my mom--who is a retired surgeon. She said probably because I didn&#x27;t work out enough, been sitting too long etc...I said I don&#x27;t think so, I had the burning feeling before on my arm, my finger, but not this long and bad. So about 4 days ago, I saw this little red rash growing on my leg, where it hurts before...I said damn it could be shingles, since where I live there&#x27;s no poison ivy, and I didn&#x27;t get close to any plants before the pain...So the next day, I saw some small, clear blisters growing on one rash spot...It was not that painful, just uncomfortable, and there were few rashes growing about 4-6inches from that blister one. By that time I&#x27;ve already started to take antivirals and used Aciclovir Gel on my rashes. I didn&#x27;t have much Aciclovir Gel so I started to look for something else I can use on the rashes. I discovered this one and purchased on Friday night, it arrived on Sunday, I just couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.&lt;br /&gt;1. The jar is not big, it&#x27;s about same size like burt&#x27;s bee almond milk hand cream...the cream itself is dark brown color, thick, and greasy feeling, kinda like peanut butter + jelly. The smell--some people don&#x27;t like it, but to me it&#x27;s fine--I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different things on my shingles and those smells 10 times worse. It&#x27;s just like honey smell added with some herb. There is a warning sign on the jar saying it WILL STAIN CLOTHES.&lt;br /&gt;2. I didn&#x27;t know how much should I use on the rashes, so first time I just put a thin layer on. I rub it good since the main part I had was just rashes with small bumps, only one spot has some blisters. It helped with the burning feeling, and also second day the rashes were not that red.&lt;br /&gt;3. I still take antivirals and use Aciclovir Gel on them, but If I stay at home, I keep the Salve on, it is helping. At night I put the salve on and wear my long sleeping pants and go to bed. I think the important thing is when sleeping, try not to put pressure on the side where the shingles are. My situation is not that bad i think...since I read some reviews they said they couldn&#x27;t sleep at night...I can sleep, but it&#x27;s just uncomfortable feeling that makes me crazy. I think this salve is great since all the &amp;#34;secret tips&amp;#34; for curing shingles mentioned either bee wax, or aloe vera.&lt;br /&gt;Now it&#x27;s been only one and half day since I used this salve...(I couldn&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s only 1 and half days!) and the blisters are def smaller! and I see black dots in them, I looked up and they say it means it&#x27;s recovering. I&#x27;m happy with how fast this shingle thing is going away!! However, You CANNOT just use this salve as your &amp;#34;life saver&amp;#34;. This is just for helping the pain, and speed up the recovering process. I don&#x27;t think it played a big role in TREAT the shingles, since shingles is caused by the virus. You need to take antivirals and use right cream like Aciclovir. Make sure you talk to your doctor about your situation. You can never rely on something $15 to get rid of your painful shingles. It need more efforts. Also, pay attention to what you eating, avoid greasy, spicy, high protein food, and seafood for a while. Keep in a good mood, calm down and don&#x27;t get anxious, angry, or depressed--those are def not helping with your shingles! All that combine you can defeat shingles!n sleeping, try not to put pressure on the side where the shingles are.

    <li> If you ever have Shingles, give this a try. It helped soothe the pain and seemed to help heal the rash and blisters. It&#x27;s a nice consistency and aroma too, and, although I&#x27;m done with the Shingles, I have been using Wonder Salve for breakouts and dry skin patches. Great product &amp; I am so glad I found it when I did!</li>
    <li> Just use, feel better, I will insist on using it, looking forward to completely restored to health soon. Very good things</li>
    <li> Seemed to work ok. It does stain things, even your fingers. lol.</li>
    <li> My son has atopi and this product helps a lot. I like that it&#x27;s a natural product so that I can use it for my child without worries.     The shipping and service was very prompt. It arrived much earlier than expected. When I asked questions, they replied with utmost promptness and accuracy. They even included sample honey candies and lots of brochures to try. I am definitely going to try more of their products.    The packaging was very sturdy and very nice.    One of the BEST AMAZON experiences I have ever had!</li>
    <li> It works,  but very messy to use its sticky and can&#x27;t use under clothes very well my shingles is on my back so I have to ware under tops</li>
    <li> I did not find this product untill after my shingles started to fade but it did seems to reduce to the itching and pain when I did start to use it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product works great</li>
    <li> Wonder-Salve is named appropriately.  It is a great product!  I used it on shingles and poison ivy.  It got rid of the itching, rash and tingling pain in less then a week.  I already ordered 2 more.</li>
    <li> It worked on the first day, never worked on the other days. Maybe I just started it too late for it to have any benefit for relief for me.</li>
    <li> In my case the product didn&#x27;t work. I applied as directed but felt no relief. I guess that the product&#x27;s effectiveness varies from person to person depending on degree of virus, personal medical history, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t try to return it as I obviously had to open it to try it.</li>
    <li> My grandpa has been in alot of pain caused by Shingles, but worse..his Shingles are located directly over a malignant tumor over his lung area. Last time he had the shingles he suffered for 6 months (which was the first time he had lung cancer.) It came back, and so did the Shingles. With everything going on,it breaks my heart to see him suffer, especially at an age of 83. I took him to the ER for pain last weekend, but they did little for him. They gave him morphine, but that only gave relief for a few hours.A friend of his that owns a local Botanic Garden store told him about the propolis ingrediant benefits. His friend had knowledge of this, but did not carry it at his store, so I found this product online from Durham Farms. Its just amazing. Amazing how well it works. It worked instantly.How can a major hospital in Chicago not be able to help, and something so natural work so well? I&#x27;m very thankful and just wanted to tell everyone reading that this product is unbelievably amazing. I&#x27;m happy my grandpa will get some sleep tonight,again thank you Durham farm. You relieved my grandpa from alot of suffering. ~Cori</li>
    <li> This was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! I&#x27;ve never, written a review before but Wonder Salve deserves the time. My wife suffered a severe bout of shingles coupled with a gall bladder removal, the removal relieved internal pain but the shingles pain has left her sleepless for over a week. We ordered Wonder Salve overnight from Amazon, it arrived in 26 hours. She applied the cream at 8:45pm, she was asleep at 9pm. At 4am she awoke refreshed and wonderfully sexed me, first time without Viagra in five years!  Don&#x27;t know how the Queen feels about Wonder Salve but this old Drone just ordered her back up supply!  Thanks Wonder Salve!

    <li> Nice product but it did nothing to help my motherinlaw with her shingles. It also stained her clothing and didn&#x27;t wash out</li>
    <li> I just got my second round of shingles in the exact same area (by the way, I&#x27;m 21, almost 22 years old). My first shingles episode was 11/24/13.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today is the 5th day since the rash has appeared (since 1/30/14), so according to the general time-frame it takes for shingles blisters to appear...mine are right on schedule. I have been on anti-viral medication since 1/31/14, but I don&#x27;t think that has helped much. Definitely do not feel as much pain as the first shingles episode since I have been on prednisone for the same time as the anti-viral pills. However, my prednisone dosage is decreasing each day (to slowly wean me off the medication and prevent side effects), so I can feel the pain returning slowly. I am probably going to take ibuprofen after I finish with the prednisone. I can&#x27;t take the pain, and ibuprofen helped me a lot in my first shingles episode (but I also got anti-inflammatory injections, which worked INSTANTLY!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first used this product today, on top of applying aloe vera gel onto the affected area. I must say...my pain was reduced significantly upon application of this product! But it had no effect on &amp;#34;prodrome&amp;#34; shingles, which is BEFORE the blisters appear. Use this product only after the blisters start forming!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my shingles is, unfortunately, on both sides of my face -- specifically, my forehead/temple areas. Moreso on my left side all the way down to my eyebrow and mid-line of the nose, but it is definitely on both sides of the face. It is soooo unsightly. I haven&#x27;t been sick or ill in more than a decade...yet I succumb to shingles TWICE. (It doesn&#x27;t help that I developed an eating disorder in last 6 years). :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay safe, people! Buy this product for your blisters only (if they ever develop)! It doesn&#x27;t work on new shingles!</li>
    <li> I received this salve and started to use it right away. And, I could honestly say it works. So, I will recommend it. You may have to wait a day or say to see the results and you will see results.</li>
    <li> My husband has a prolonged case of the shingles and the meds were making him loopy. So, we tried this and he was pleased. It has helped make him more comfortable. I think if we found this earlier on, there would have been more relieved. This salve will stain clothes but that&#x27;s a small price to pay to be comfortable. We are very pleased.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to try and get some relief from the pain of shingles..When you have shingles you will just about try anything to try and get some relief..I searched the web and Amazon for a product that might do that..I was very hopeful..but it did nothing but stain my clothes.. Neither is it a wonder or is it awesome....very disappointed.....Would never recommend it to anyone in fact it is false advertisement.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have auto immune disease. I get shingles every other month. This is the best product for rash , clearing up shingles. I will buy again</li>
    <li> If you suffer from chapped lips, cold sores or shingles, this product offers quick relief for a topically applied product.  Daily use on your lips prevents chapping.  Be careful as this product will stain your clothing, so use a tissue to clean off excess after applying this product.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t help the shingles pain and I was shocked to see that the first ingredient is petroleum which is not a natural product.  I think I would have used it anyway despite the petroleum if it had helped my shingles pain, but It didn&#x27;t give me any relief.</li>
    <li> Did not relieve any pain at all when applied to shoulder area.  Shingles rash was almost all gone at the time when tried.  We tried st john&#x27;s wart salve that we got from the local herb shop and that took the pain away withing several minutes.  So far that has been the best pain reliever for topical application for that shoulder pain that was caused by the shingles.</li>
    <li> My son bought me Wonder salve for shingles but I was way past shingles and had phn. so the salve didn&#x27;t help much there but it is wonderful on poison oak. Suffering that used to take a couple of weeks and spread now with the salve just a couple of days. Great name for a great product.</li>
    <li> Saw all the other reviews that said this stuff was worth buying.They are RIGHT!!!  Had a very painful and sudden outbreak of shingles. Doctor gave some pain meds, but was still hurting badly.     Got this salve on Monday afternoon and by Wednesday (today) am pain free. Noticed that on Tuesday evening, I wasn&#x27;t watching the clock to see when I could take my next dose of pain meds. Wow, I was impressed. I only had used this once Monday evening,and once Tuesday morning, and already the pain is going away. By Wednesday morning, when I put the salve on, I noticed the places were drying up,still a little painful when touched, but BIG improvement. No pain at all during the day Wednesday. I just realized it is a little after 9pm,Wednesday night, and I have NO pain at all. Amazing!!! No need for pain meds tonight then. I will continue using the salve twice a day until the rash has completely gone. At the rate its disappearing, I figure that it should be gone by the end of the week.    This is really some great stuff, it delivers exactly as it promises to. As for the comment I saw on here about the color, greasiness, and texture of this product. It feels no different than vaseline on your skin. Besides----who really cares what it looks like when it works as well as it does? Anyone who has ever had the shingles is willing to try anything for relief--and this product gives relief quickly.</li>
    <li> Bought this because of the reviews here on Amazon and elsewhere. I wouldn&#x27;t call it immediate relief, but as the shingles pain dimmed, the salve worked better and faster.  I believe it speeded the healing.  My mom had been on Valtrex and Lidocaine ointment, both of which did NOTHING. It definitely takes some time to get used to.  Make sure you rub it in well, for a few minutes, so it really sinks in.  Wash your hands when done, as it is brown and goopy but definitely does the trick.  I would recommend to anyone who has shingles pain and rash.</li>
    <li> Of course like every other Shingles sufferer I was desperate for relief from the pain, burning and itching associated with this terrible virus. If this paste had relieved any of the symptoms I would have been happy. It is made mediocre ingredients which is why I gave it one star. Save your money and have your Dr. write a script for 5% Lidocaine Patches for the burning and itching, Percoset for the pain and Valtrex for the virus. If your nerve pain persists more than 3 weeks also have the Dr. write a script for Gabapentin .&lt;br /&gt;My heart goes out to all. Hang tough , it does get better.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my Mom who came down with  shingles approximately a week ago.  Drs said to use Cortisone, but I like to go natural if possible.  Searched Amazon and read reviews and was very impressed with reviews.  Ordered it overnight.  Works just like most said it would.  Blisters and rash 80% clear within 3 days. She has shown very little indication that she was in pain since using the Wonder Salve.  Would definitely recommend it and I have recommended to my Moms Hospice Nurse and she&lt;br /&gt;said she would recommend it to other patients who have shingles.</li>
    <li> My mom suffers from a terrible case of psoriasis and nothing has helped except cortisone. I found this product and brought it to her and it is the first time she has felt relief in years!!! As soon as she feels her skin flaring up, she applies a tiny amount of this product and it stops the itchiness, therefore preventing each flare transforming into days of pain and open wounds that she cannot help scratching.&lt;br /&gt;The pots are tiny, much smaller than I anticipated, but she only needs to apply so little. It ships worldwide, too (especially from the company&#x27;s website).</li>
    <li> Voltaire (1694 - 1778), the French philosopher once said, \\&quot;The art of medicine consists of amusing the patient while nature cures the disease\\&quot;.  There is no question that the body is extremely efficient at curing a wide variety of diseases.  The question I have about Wonder Salve is how much of the treatment should be attributed to the product and how much was a result of the natural curing process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what happened to me.  On a Saturday morning, I noticed a few small red bumps a few inches below my left armpit.  I suspected an insect bite.  By the following Wednesday there was a red rash from the front of my chest extending around to my back.  I went to the doctor and it was confirmed as a case of shingles.  The doctor said that since I had not been treated within 48- 72 hours, the current treatment would not be effective.  That normally the rash starts to clear up in two weeks. The best I could do would be to find an over the counter treatment which might relieve some of the burning/itching/pain. The doctor recommended domeboro.  But the recommendation was so weak that I did not feel strongly about trying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a Google search and found Wonder Salve.  I read many of the reviews on Amazon.com and decided to give it a try.  I ordered the product on a Thursday and received it on Saturday.  By that time I had the shingles for a full week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the Wonder Salve each night for the next six nights.  I had purchased the one ounce jar and by the sixth application the supply was depleted.  The product seemed to give some slight relief immediately upon application.  By the end of the second week, the rash was starting to show some signs of improvement.  I cannot say for certain if the results were primarily from the Wonder Salve or if the shingles were simply running the normal course - the body was healing itself.  Since I did not do any split testing - applying Wonder Salve to some of the rash and leaving some untreated, I cannot say how much of the relief was attributed to the product and how much was natural healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The literature says the product will stain your clothes.  This is an understatement.  The product will ruin whatever you are wearing.  I wore an old T-shirt and then an old dress shirt.  The T-shirt was totally ruined and the outer shirt was stained.  Do not wear any clothing around the affected area that you are not ready to part with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one other question I have about the product.  What part does the placebo/nocebo effect play in the results?  The placebo effect is where you get results from a product but the product was not responsible for the results.  This often happens when people believe they are going to get relief by using a particular product/treatment but it is the belief and not the product/treatment that it the primary cause.  The nocebo effect is the opposite of the placebo effect.  You should get the results but because you don&#x27;t believe you will, you create negative results.  Medical research has shown that the placebo effect occurs about thirty percent of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I am not sure how beneficial the product was.  It certainly helped some and if you do not have a better alternative, then by all means this product offers some relief.  Realize it is extremely messy and will ruin any garment which comes into direct contact with it.not say how much of the relief was attributed to the product and how much was natural healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The literature says the product will stain your clothes.

    <li> This is the second time that this salve has singlehandedly saved my son from poison ivy. Where prescription lotions failed, this propolis salve worked!</li>
    <li> Yes I’am sorry but your product for Shingles doesn’t work&lt;br /&gt;my pain is postherpetic?  I can express more words because&lt;br /&gt;I dont speak ingles verry well</li>
    <li> We tried all kind of stuff from olive oil, coconut oil, shea butter, triple paste, baby antibiotic cream, etc. Our 10 month old baby boy had rash, maybe teething rash, on both cheeks for over 2 months now. We put wonder salve before bed and next morning his cheeks were visible better. Today is day 3 and we can tell that is working for sure. I need to mention that we bought it directly from Durham&#x27;s as other reviewer mentioned to be sure that is fresh and not sticky. It is very easy to put on his cheeks.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend has the shingles and had not slept in 3 days because of the pain, so i was on the search for something to dull the pain a bit and came across Wonder Salve. I figured we might as well give it a shot... Couldn&#x27;t get much worse so I had it shipped overnight. I&#x27;ll go ahead and say that this product does not smell or look very pleasant. It is a very dark brown color and WILL stain your clothing. But it worked wonders for my boyfriend. It did not take away the pain completely (i don&#x27;t imagine anything could do that), but he is now able to sleep. His pain is no longer unbareable, just more of an annoyance like a simple rash. And i am now considered to be a miracle worker :)</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom; it did not provide any relief for her shingles.</li>
    <li> It helps drying out new rash and eliminating the redness of the skin. It also takes away the itchiness but not the shingles pain. Quite greasy and it stained any clothes big time, otherwise I like it</li>
    <li> Well the type of work my husband does keeps him with dry&amp; flakey skin. So &#x27;Wonder Salve&#x27; did a great job in repairing his skin.it also helped to smooth out&amp;Provide relief to other damage areas of his back. Wonder Salve works! I only wished I&#x27;d ordered a bigger Jar!</li>
    <li> Provides relief, only issue is transfers to clothes to easily. Well worth the price one has to pay. Would use again if needed.</li>
    <li> Have had to deal with my eczema on my hands due to hospital soap since November. Applied this AWESOME product last night. Woke up with my dry non-swollen and non-itchi hands. I wished I&#x27;d known this product sooner. So happy and very satisfied. Will absolutely recommend this product to another co-worker who suffer the same condition as mine.</li>
    <li> Its a wonder people are allowed to sell stuff like this - that&#x27;s the only &amp;#34;wonder&amp;#34; of this salve!. It looks awful and did nothing for my needs. It went in the trash!</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift that &amp;#34;might help&amp;#34; a friend with shingles who was under a doctor&#x27;s care and still suffered.  She is so grateful for the quick relief it brought to her.</li>
    <li> did little to relieve the pain and itching,might work better for someone else.i would not recemmed it to anyone else.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t take care of shingles.</li>
    <li> Product will stain any garments covering the areas covered as warned by the vendor. Helps with night sleep if used for shingles.</li>
    <li> It is a miracle cream for shingles.  My mother was in such pain and when I bought this it gave great releif.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice, all natural salve. However, it did nothing to relieve my shingles - which were excruciating. Additionally, as the package warns IT WILL STAIN EVERYTHING. Ugly yellow stains! If you have shingles, you have my sympathy and you are probably desperate to buy ANYTHING to relieve them. Many other reviewers indicated it gave them relief, so maybe it&#x27;s worth a try. But it did nothing for me. Just make sure you cover it with an old t-shirt and sleep on a towel, because it is greasy and will seep and stain everything it touches.</li>
    <li> I have only used this salve three times and already I can tell a difference.  I have patches of ezema and dry skin on my face and legs. It feels very soothing and I like the smell.  I will purchase this salve again.</li>
    <li> Wonder Salve is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used when it comes to skin treatment.  My co-workers say that I look much younger than my age.  I believe that this beauty cream helps me maintain my youth.    We always buy bee products from Durham because their products really work and Mr. Tim, Sr. is a very reliable person.    Thank you very much, Mr. Tim Sr.     Alex and Ditas</li>
    <li> It has relieved the itching caused by shingles on my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently had shingles which has left me with nerve damage to my right face. The pain has been very bad especially near my ear. I&#x27;ve found that covering my ear with a warm towel for a few minutes and then applying Wonder Salve in that area, the pain is calmed and reduced in a few minutes. It&#x27;s been a sugnificant help to me during this very painful time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this on dry patches on my body, also to treat my poison ivy rashes, along w/ dry lips using it as a lip moisturizer at night.  Very impressed w/ this salve!  I made sure when I put it in my skin that I was wearing dark colored clothing so it wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal if it stained, but it really helped w/ my poison ivy itching.  I had a big patch on my stomach, it kept it moisturized and didn&#x27;t itch after a few days.  Would recommend for sure!</li>
    <li> This salve gave my mom a great deal of relief from the severe pain of Shingles. She would put it on the affected area and it would help her sleep through the night.</li>
    <li> I had Shingles for several months before I learned what it was and went to see a doctor. The first time I used the Wonder-Salvo, the Shingles bumps were spreading rapidly. I had a care person vigorously rub the brown salve over the entire area of shingles bumps, and I took Vicodin to hide the pain.  The next day the shingles bumps were gone.  After months of pain that I had suffered, my very unpleasant experience with Shingles came to an end.  I reported this to Dr. Sty, who had prescribed the Shingle medicine (valacyclovir 1 gm, 3 times daily for 7 days).  He was impressed, and he copied the information about Wonder-Salvo.  Dr. Sty works at FIRST MED at125 Riverbend Drive, Charlottesville, Va  22911.</li>
    <li> I found this ointment/salve last year frustrated with the constant shingles breakout in my upper thigh area. I have used the salve and the shingles disappeared. I still use it for small breakouts and now I will try it on my eczema. I am very grateful for this product.......</li>
    <li> First, let me preface this with why I purchased the Wonder Salve.&lt;br /&gt;I was diagnosed with acute shingles five days after the rash started. I thought I had an outbreak of dermatitis on my arm. The bumps and itching were very similar, except the rash kept spreading, which was atypical. I&#x27;ve suffered from dermatitis for years and have yet to find anything that helped, but I digress. I bought this for an alleged shingles rash. Note, I said this rash is 3 weeks old now. It hasn&#x27;t blistered the way it&#x27;s supposed to. I took a course of anti-viral for 7 days as prescribed and while it started to settle the rash down, as soon as the course was finished, the rash came back. So, definitively, am unsure if it&#x27;s shingles, however I have had minor nerve pain along the affected arm. (Real minor.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wonder salve is a brownish/dark golden pasty ointment and is very sticky. As noted on the container, it will stain clothing. I first applied it to a bare arm and wiped it off about 45 minutes later. Later on today I put some more on and covered it in gauze while I napped for a couple of hours. I took the gauze off and showered and removed the rest of the salve. The raised bumps/lumps from the rash seemed to have shrunk. It still has an angry red look to it, but it&#x27;s softened up the skin and that means it&#x27;s doing some good. Dry skin (without shingles) in general can be rather itchy and painful. After two days of use, finally my shingles rash started to progress. Some people may be alarmed, but I had the rash for 3 weeks with just inflammation and unsightliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After 48 hours of use of the Wondersalve, I had to stop using it. I am convinced that the wonder salve pulled the virus out and got the rash to the next stage. Initially a burning sensation that required ice packs to help relieve the burn and the next morning, my rash started seeping. I didn&#x27;t get the traditional blisters, or they were very small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t use the salve after that untiltoday (a week later) because I felt my skin needed a break and to give it a chance to heal on its own. I applied the salve to remaining rash again today as it looks like it may flare up again (this is a very stubborn case of shingles) and it&#x27;s not causing any pain, but my hope is that if there is more virus that needs to come out, will be drawn out by the salve, instead of just lingering for another 3 weeks in an unsightly mass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I went for this salve was because it has Propolis in it and I gave some Propolis liquid extract (from another company) to a family member a few years back. She used it to treat a severe infection on her legs (she&#x27;s diabetic) and she mixed it with cream she had been using previously and when she added the Propolis, she finally got results and her skin healed up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin, but I think this salve is good to aid in healing the skin, not just masking the problem. It just may not work as you expect it to. In fact, in my case, it appears to be reacting to virus the way the wound of a white tail spider bite reacted after applying active manuka honey. It was that action I speak of that gave me cause to realize that I had been poisoned by a spider and why I think bee products are wonderful and trying to draw out toxins.</li>
    <li> I think it says that best by 03/2010!! And the cream become black! The most strange thing I ve ever smelled! Cant believe this.</li>
    <li> i bought this for shingles,it has some of the ingreting as the others still helpful ,but the texture is nuuuuuuuuuu.</li>
    <li> Nothing like using natural bee products, I use it for just plain bad skin acme etc.  Only used it a week and seems to helping my &#x27;old dry skin look&#x27; also for psoriasis.</li>
    <li> My wife said it did nothing for her?Wish we can give it a better say on the wonder salve BUT!!!!</li>
    <li> My friend had a very severe case of shingles.  Wonder Salve worked to help ease the pain even when a narcotic skin patch didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says it&#x27;s supposed to do for Shingles.</li>
    <li> It helped, but did not completely solve my problem, I am glad I bought this product and recommend it as a relief alternative.</li>
    <li> I have Lyme Disease and have much pain from that alone....then a month or so ago, I came down with Shingles on top of the Lyme....The pain was unbearable.  I began taking major pain relievers and that made it difficult and eventually impossible to drive.  I was losing money from not attending work (my own business)and I thought there must be an answer.  I looked online and found the Wonder Salve .....  I could not believe a salve could make me feel better since even major pain pills couldn&#x27;t do the job....  But it arrived in the mail and that night, I smeared it all over my Shingles and went to bed.  The next day was very painful all afternoon and then it stopped...100% it just went away!  It&#x27;s been two weeks and I can not believe there has been NO return of pain..... This really is a miracle salve...</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work on my shingles. I ordered it with another item that did work. I&#x27;m keeping it for other things that it may be good to use on. I do like the product though.</li>
    <li> It has help some and is very safe&lt;br /&gt;to use all so lasted a long time</li>
    <li> This product leaves a mess on any item that comes in&lt;br /&gt;contact with it. Any ointment would give as much relief&lt;br /&gt;as it for one third of its price. I do not blame the distributor,&lt;br /&gt;but it is not &amp;#34;awesome&amp;#34; as they advertise</li>
    <li> I had a very light case of the shingles.  This stuff stains like mad.  I bought a new cotton bra without wires as my shingles were on my  &amp;#34;you know what&amp;#34;.  only one, but it totally stained the bra.  but I personally would not use it for that reason.  I didn&#x27;t notice that it really helped that much.  sorry.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both ended up with shingles at the same time.  I know your next question -- didn&#x27;t you get the shingles shot?  Yes the both of us got our shot two years before we both got it.  By the way, its not contagious.  According to my neurologist, the shot does not work.  Anyway back to the product, we did not find it effective.  We were in so much pain nothing helped except Valtrex.</li>
    <li> Dont know if it worked or not I got this for someone elnce to try out,they didnt get back with me.</li>
    <li> works wonders good for a lot things such as healing minor sores &amp; scrapes</li>
    <li> After applying this balm to my afflicted area (facial Shingles) for two days, the rash went away.  It stings a little when you first apply it, but that soon goes away and the relief begins.</li>
    <li> I started with a severe case of shingles last Friday. I saw the Dr on saturday, who confirmed it and prescribed an anti viral med and painkillers. By Monday, I had shingles from the center of my spine in a 3 inch band to my abdomen. It was incredibly painful and I could not work,sit,stand,sleep etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the Wonder Salve on Monday and it arrived Wednesday, (standard shipping). I opened the salve and applied it to the shingles- one thing I noticed within an hour was how much the pain had subsided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, today is Friday and I have been using the salve for three days- I would say that the redness, blisters pain, etc has diminished by 80% during that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The salve smells a little strange, and is the color of molasses but if you have ever had shingles, that is NOTHING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered more- not because I need it now, but of it works thid well for shingles as severe as mine were, I will use it for minor skin irritations and fever blisters in the future.</li>
    <li> Wonder salve was used for the Herpes Zoster blisters my husband had around his eye and on his scalp and nose.  He said the salve was soothing and the blisters were not as painful</li>
    <li> Bogus claims. tried for over a week with no relief at all. very very disappointed.  I&#x27;m surprised at Amazon for marketing this.</li>
    <li> Sent it to my son who contracted shingles, poor guy. Said it helped. That&#x27;s all he said, not much of a talker.</li>
    <li> Anyone suffering from the shingles will likely be willing to try anything to relieve the pain.  Don&#x27;t wait!  Get this amazing product and give yourself some relief.</li>
    <li> I got shingles for the 1 time and am taking anti viral and pain meds . I was looking for more relief and come across several products some cost as much 49.95 and then come across durhams wonder salve bought it for 19.95 and has rave reviews  got the 1 day shipping really glad i purchased wonder salve felt immediate pain relief sores looked started to look better the next day . thanks for a great product</li>
    <li> This worked for temporary relief of my moms shingles pain. She rubbed it on and it helped with the pain right away so she could go to sleep at night. I will buy this again if she has any more flair ups. We both thank you very much!</li>
    <li> I bought this salve because I got all the discomforts of shingles and was desperate for relief from all the nasty symptoms.  I had read the reviews and was impressed, but not convinced about healing or making great improvements within three days.  To my great surprise, I was very pleased with the immediate relief I got.  I had tried the Caladryl Lotion which the dermatologist had recommended, but it only made the itching worse prior to using this Wonder Salve.  I have also been taking Prednisone 7 day treatment and the anit-viral prescribed pills, but the symptoms continued to be very uncomfortable.  I have used almost half of the Wonder Salve and the rash is almost disappearing and dried up, plus, the itching has subsided compared to how it was 5 days ago.  The Salve does stain your skin and clothes, and dries up your fingers, so I recommend using plastic gloves or Q-tips to apply to skin rash.  For anyone who is plagued with the miserable discomforts of shingles, this is a blessing!  I highly recommend it and I am grateful that I was able to get it so soon after I ordered it.</li>
    <li> If I could give zero stars I would - they lied about ingredients - it has petroleum jelly and mineral oil - the whole reason i bought this was as a natural, good for you cure - the above two are not good for anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for wasting my time.</li>
    <li> This really is wonderful for the shingles!! It does stain clothing but did a wonderful job relieving  the pain and itching! I would recommend Wonder Salve for anyone with shingles!!</li>
    <li> I know that there are all kinds of stuff out there promising the moon&lt;br /&gt;I know that you ar e feeling stunned and somewhat embarrassed about&lt;br /&gt;the fact you have this horrible stuff growing on you (shingles).&lt;br /&gt;I know you are a little crazy because all this happened to me.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this \\&quot;Wonder Salve\\&quot; out of desperation.  I read the reviews&lt;br /&gt;and said it was too good to be true AND I tried it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;This is good stuff.... it will take away 90% of the discomfort&lt;br /&gt;and let you sleep and keep you from looking like a goon at&lt;br /&gt;work becasue you are scratching yourself.  It works!</li>
    <li> THIS TRULY A WONDER SALVE</li>
    <li> I JUST GOT SHINGLES AND ORDERED THIS.  I CAN NOT TELL YOU HOW MUCH IT HELPED  IT HELPED WITH ITCHING AND PAIN.  I AM GOING TO PURCHASE OTHER PRODUCTS FROM THIS DURHAMS BEE FARM  I AM THRILLED WITH THIS PURCHASE  I AM AN RN AND I AM RECOMMENDING IT TO MY PATIENTS</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on the ingredients, not for Shingles specifically. It helped me with an eye infection (bacteria) as well infections on my feet.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I had a case of the shingles and it help relieve the pain that shingles produce. The only issue is this product will stain your clothes. I used a cloth between my skin and my clothes and this helped with this.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just OKAY, not great.  I think I had some relief but found it difficult to tolerate the smell and consistency of the cream.  The product is very expensive and the results are not worth of the amount of money you have to spend to purchase the product.  Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I was so hoping this would work ... ordered and paid for the two day shipping based on the many positive reviews. It did nothing. I tried it for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;I see there is a disclaimer for its efficacy on Post Herpetic Neuralgia -- maybe that&#x27;s why it did not work for me -- the shingles was mostly over by the time I used this product.&lt;br /&gt;It was greasy as many have complained about --- if it worked I could have lived with the greasyness. If you have PHN --- this may not be the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What did work:&lt;br /&gt;  Neurontin that I did not initially want my Dr. to prescribe brought the pain down to a more manageable level - still hurts, but not as much. Spikes at night for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;  Apple cider vinegar with baking soda mixed to get rid of the acidity help a little.&lt;br /&gt;  Cold paper towels or ice helped when burning came.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Aloe Vera gel did not seem to make much of a difference, but Wegman&#x27;s After&#x3D;sun Aloe Gel with Lidocaine helped - a little.</li>
    <li> A family owned business with incredible products. Very high quality and the products work as described. No need to second guess buying from tis company. Just do it, they will not let you down!</li>
    <li> This salve did what it says it does. Would recommend  for shingles.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item after researching topical ointments for shingles treatment. I had a case of shingles, which had already gone through most of its stages. I had already used up a doctor&#x27;s prescription, and was trying different topical lotions/ointments to help ease the pain and itching. After receiving Wonder-Salve, I immediately put it to use. However, my experience with it was not  miraculous as I had hoped. It did not help ease the pain or itching as I had hoped, nor did it seem to heal the rash in any way. It was gooey, and had a yellow color which stained my skin, and got into my clothes. After several days of attempting to give it a chance to do something, I gave up and moved on to other lotions. Unfortunately, it did not work for me...but everyone&#x27;s body is different, so it may be that it works for others.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product just last week because my fiance&#x27; has shingles for the first time and we were looking for a product that would help relieve the itch and soreness of this virus.  We started using it the first day and within 3 days the rash had subsided and has not increased at all.  We are very happy with this product and will likely try other products from this company.  We always try natural products whenever possible.  Thank you Wonder Salve!!!</li>
    <li> No immediate pain relief for me, maybe for some people. Still have pain here. Free Honey Candy with orders was nice.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my granddaughter who has eczema. This salve was amazing. It started to clear her skin the next day. Her skin keeps getting better.Tried it on cuts it also helps to heal them quicker. Stuff works great.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the greatest!! It took care of my shingles rash right away and my mom uses it on her Psoriasis and dry skin.</li>
    <li> The product did not do anything for what I ordered it for - shingles itch; however that is not to say it is not a good product for something else.  It came as expected as far as shipping was concerned</li>
    <li> did not get any results treating itching from shingles</li>
    <li> Works really well for ezcema!! My 2 y.o. daughter has very dry cheeks during winters and no lotion was helping her.  My friend told me about this and how it did wonders for her so I tried it and it cleared my daughter&#x27;s dry skin within couple of days of using it!</li>
    <li> Worked great for my Sis and the person who told us about it. We recomend it. DS thank you everyone</li>
    <li> I woke up with shingles about 6 days ago on my neck.  Luckily I started antivirals pretty quickly so I was able to keep it from spreading too much, but the sores and area were quite painful and swollen.  I was desperate because the cream my doctor prescribed me was doing NOTHING for me, so I came on Amazon, did a search for shingle treatment,  and saw Wonder Salve.  Just based on the reviews I bought it on the spot.  I received the product yesterday afternoon, and applied it right away.  Immediately I felt a difference- it soothed the itch and the pain on contact.  (Yes, perhaps the product can stain clothing, which the company warns you about in the packaging, but it works, and it has a really pleasant fragrance.)  I applied 3 or 4 different times throughout the day, and less than 10 hours later, I could not believe how much better the sores looked.  Even my boyfriend was in shock.  This morning there has even been more of an improvement.  I have decided to order other products from this company based on the amazing results!  If you have shingles, definitely give this product a try.  I am truly amazed.</li>
    <li> I came down with a case of the shingles. This was not a fun time. I had painful blisters on my back and stomach. I used the salve and it gave me immediate relief. I woul recommend this product to anyone who has shingles. This is a natural  product. It will stain your clothes. I wore a old tee shirt.</li>
    <li> Horrible smell, extremely gooey and difficult to apply. I received no relief from my Shingles. Terrible stuff!</li>
    <li> This salve does give relief from the pain of shingles. I used it continuously during an outbreak and was very pleased with how it worked.</li>
    <li> Wonder salve appears to be good for many types of wounds I use it for my lips and any insect bites.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have shingles.  I get itching when I eat the wrong foods (or wine for that matter).  The itching is pretty severe and this stuff works real well.  I put it on once when things get bad and I&#x27;m good for a few days.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after having my first bout with shingles.  Fortunately, I have not had a second episode so haven&#x27;t used it for shingles relief yet.  However, a friend/dental hygienist at work burnt her hand badly (entire hand and fingers were red &amp; painful, and large blister on the palm of her hand). Several co-workers thought she needed to go to the emergency room.  I looked the product up online to see if I could apply it to a burn.  I had the wonder salve in my purse  so applied it to the palm of her hand and covered it with a non stick bandage  She quickly felt relief from the pain. She left it on over the weekend (this happened on a Thursday night) and changed the dressing once.  She was back at work Tuesday with a small callus in the center of her hand.  She said the product was amazing and helped a great deal with the pain.</li>
    <li> A bit funky but helps sooth pain.</li>
    <li> I was having excruciating pain, and the only thing that helped was Betadine, which kills viruses and inhibits viral replication. It would slow things down, but did not seem to aid in healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I started using this bee propolis salve on top if dried Betadine, things started actually healing! Additional research revealed that propolis also kills viruses and inhibits replication, so I have switched to just this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it&#x27;s waxy and actually sticks to skin, helped soothe the pain, and FINALLY allowed healing to begin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone suffering from a bacterial or viral related skin problem. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR CARRYING THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
    <li> i tried the product for some relief from shingles and after several applications did not notice any improvement  from itch or pain - for shingles in my case absolutely worthless</li>
    <li> I would have tried almost anything to get rid of the shingles pain I was experiencing a few weeks ago.  I was not quite ready to use prescription pain meds yet, though.  So, I tried this Wonder Salve.  It does have an unpleasant odor and stains everything.  Also, keep in mind that it is very sticky and could be a problem if used on an area covered in hair.</li>
    <li> I get chigger &amp; skeeter bites/poison ivy, so thought I&#x27;d try the Wonder-Salve on them as a test run.  Usually chigger bites take a LONG time to resolve itself, leave a dark scar and I&#x27;ll do anything to shorten the healing time. I have (at present) chigger and poison ivy problems so I applied a nice thick dressing of Wonder Salve to the areas, applied a bandage to keep everything in place (did this before bedtime). I will have to  say that this stuff pulls the inflammation/itch and discomfort from the site and really does the trick for speedy healing.  It does have a distinctive odor but I like it.&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback to this product is this:  I wish they could find another  substitute of their formula(s)  for the Petroleum base in this salve. There are alternatives to petroleum which are far better and I do wish they could take this one ingredient out of their products but this is a good product and it does work.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really help me, although it doesn&#x27;t really seem anything helps the shingles.  Very messy and will stain your clothes</li>
    <li> I have used this before.  It is truly a miracle for shingles.</li>
    <li> It an&#x27;t worth it, DO NOT BUY IT..I WAITED MORE THAN A WEEK TO RECEIVED IT AND AS SOON AS I PUT IT ON IT WORSE MY CONDITION. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, THIS PRODUCT HAS MORE REVIEWS AND 90% OF THOSE REVIEWS ARE COMING FROM UNKNOWN SOURCES.</li>
    <li> My husband came down with a nasty case of shingles a few weeks ago (his first time) and was in a lot of discomfort and and looked like he had 3rd degree burns on his neck.  Of course the first thing we did was hit the internet to research how to get rid it.  In our search we found many many glowing reviews for Wonder Slave and after reading all the rave reviews from random people we ordered some.  It took a few days to get here and of course the shingles got even worse with little help from other tips we read.  Finally when the Wonder Salve got here he put it on at around 4 pm - he put it on again and went to sleep - by the time he woke up his skin was normal color and didnt itch or hurt any longer.  He continued with the treatment for a few days to be sure it was gone -- it was absolutely amazing.  We are ordering another jar in case it ever pops up again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one tip I can offer is it worked better if it was rubbed in very well - plus by doing this - it stained his shirt and pillow case less - but it WILL stain - so make sure you are willing to have a few pieces of clothing get a little messy depending on where you need to use the salve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously - amazing stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this tip and review helps.</li>
    <li> These products are great and work very well.  Thank you Mother Nature.  Next time you want to squash a bee -- remember they are our friends .  OUCH !</li>
    <li> My husband had shingles so I started searching for a miracle product that could help him with his pain.&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly say Wonder Salve gave him relief and it also helped him with the healing process&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> It worked OK. Not the immediate relief that is advertised but did help some.&lt;br /&gt;I did not reorder.&lt;br /&gt;It may work better for others but after 2 months still suffering with shingles.</li>
    <li> My shingles pain is in left shoulder.  Over three years now.  Tried a lot of things.  This product, while a bit hard to apply because it&#x27;s sticky, does provide some relief---beyond other remedies.  Seems to last about two hours.</li>
    <li> It did not help with the pain ..  I was not happy with it at all .. I would not recommend it for shingles ..</li>
    <li> I used the cream and it&#x27;s very good cream. It gives immediate relief for the price, it&#x27;s very great quality.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Will stain fabrics but it works great.</li>
    <li> This is an all natural way to take care of your skin problems.  really works but need to be careful of staining.</li>
    <li> how about few words like they dont fit size not good thats all i can say if you cant put it on your feet how good can it be</li>
    <li> it really cured my skin within one or two weeks. once I feel dry or uncomfortable with my skin, I would apply it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Reduced both pain &amp; itch associated with onset of shingles. Early recognition of the problemhelped to lessen it&#x27;s effects.</li>
    <li> You will feel the effectiveness of Wonder Salves from the first 3 hours,&lt;br /&gt;make sure to use it over night because it will help you to sleep better without any pain&lt;br /&gt;or itching.</li>
    <li> This Is an &amp;#34;Awsome Product for So Many Healing Needs......Especially The God-Awful Shingles Disease.!  This product has been found in so many cases/situations requiring &amp;#34;the natural healing processs through-the-will-of-God Way-Only Way!  The Wonder Salve Has Done a GREAT JOB With &amp;#34;the healings of the &amp;#34;Horrible Body Menace-Shingles&amp;#34;!  My wife has had shingles twice I past 2 yrs.....The Wonder Salve, So Help Me God......Has Been an Absolute Blessing...So Help me God!  Les/BettyHolman</li>
    <li> I bought it to help a friend, she would NOT continue ie give it a chance.  It was the&lt;br /&gt;clothing - staining that got in way .... Product does indicate this would happen, I&lt;br /&gt;was OK with this .  Let me tell you why.  I am a New Englander over 70 , I remember&lt;br /&gt;my Grandmother &amp; Mother using a &amp;#34;Black Salve&amp;#34; that worked, I think this product&lt;br /&gt;can be compared to what my Grandmother used  I will keep in my cabinet in case&lt;br /&gt;I have need of it .....I do wish MY friend would have given it more time.</li>
    <li> Initially this salve seemed to help my mother with Howe shingles but after a few days it did nothing. Perhaps if she had used it in the beginning it would have helped more. It was a disappointment for me as I wanted to find something to take away the pain.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to find some relief from this Wonder-Salve. However no relief of any kind was experienced.This is the 6th. Year of pains from Shingles and i was having high hopes.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if there was a refund offered.&lt;br /&gt;Ernest Dern</li>
    <li> In 2010 my husband had a large case of shingles. The Doctor gave him some very expencive meds that did not help with the pain.  We looked on the internet under shingles and Wonder Salve came up.  We tried the product and now most all my family us it, including my 105 year old grandmother. She had the shingles about 10 years ago and still has problems with the nerve pain.  She uses Wonder Salve every morning, and is able to get up and do around her home without the sharp pain going through her side.  Thank you God and Jim for providing this product.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful! My husband has an infection on a private area (Blantis) that does not respond to any other medication. Little is understood about this infection, but it is miserable. The doctor prescribed an ointment at nearly $170 a pop that did absolutely nothing. Finally my husband had to have surgery. After that the skin started growing together, and further surgery was proposed. We then saw an ad about this product (Durham&#x27;s Wonder Salve). We thought we would give it a try. Are we glad we did! It has softened the skin, the skin does not grow together, it stays loose and lubricated, and does not appear or feel infected any more. We hae just ordered another container, and will be buying it for life! Wonderful stuff!!!</li>
    <li> I got this today. I have had shingles for about a week. The blisters were starting to dry out. A couple days ago I was in a lot of pain and the itching was horrible. Yesterday I started using Jason aloe vera and calamine lotion. That helped. Today when I got this product I put all 3 of those on the blisters. Since they were starting to heal already, I&#x27;m not totally sure how much this product helped. I know the Jason aloe vera cream felt amazing,though. I would recommend trying all three of these products. It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
    <li> I bought this when I came down with Shingles, and although I think that it may have helped some,&lt;br /&gt;if I ever come down with Shingles again, I will most likely try something else, if I want something&lt;br /&gt;to put directly on the shingles.  Before I purchased this, I was using 100% Aloe Vera Gel, and I&lt;br /&gt;think that it helped as well, and was much cheaper!  But I also began taking OREGANO OIL CAPSULES&lt;br /&gt;(Now brand) several times a day, which helps the immune system, and I believe those also helped a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Plus I would apply alcohol with a cotton ball periodically, to help dry them up.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways - if you purchase this - BE AWARE: IT STAINS CLOTHING! I ruined a couple of shirts before I realized that I was not going to be able to get the stain out; just a heads-up here!</li>
    <li> After using it several days,we found that It did not help to the skin problems indeed. Disjointing. No wonder happens</li>
    <li> I have shingles and have been suffering with itching, blisters, and pain. I have been using Wonder Salve for 2 days and I am amazed how quickly my skin has healed, blisters gone and itching subsided. I finally feel like I&#x27;m on the mend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone suffering from shingles. I wish I had found this product weeks ago.</li>
    <li> Despite the claims and even some reviews, this did not work for my mother&#x27;s shingles, which is the only reason I bought it. It may be fine for the other ailments it claims to relieve but in this case it was a waste of money. I&#x27;m sure what this points out is that everyone is different in terms of their own bodies so what may work for some will not work for others. Of course, you should know that going in; that there are no guarantees of efficacy for a product like this. It did, as the description states, create severe stains on clothing. So aside from not working and staining clothes it was a perfect product.</li>
    <li> Wonder Salve was purchased to relieve  pain from Shingles as was reported in previous reviews.  Sorry to report It has done nothing for the pain.</li>
    <li> Wonder Salve&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t work for me.  Seems it irritated my skin instead of helping my nerve pain from the shingles, so I stopped using it after 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried any other product..</li>
    <li> smells rather like tar.  did nothing for my problem.  large price.  small quantity.  rather like the tar shampoo I use on my dog.  I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I, personally, did not find this product to bring amazing relief; but have hope that i can use it in other situations perhaps.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Wonder Salve to see if it worked on a sebaceous cyst, even though it advertised to use it for shingles.  Well, it worked better than I expected.  The last time this cyst flared up, I was on penicillin for 10 days and only close to the 10th day did it start draining.  The Wonder Salve had it draining in four days.  It still is releasing residue and I keep the Wonder Salve on it as often as I like.  The Wonder Salve also helped a recent pimple scar go away sooner than I expected.  I was getting impatient with the scar still remaining.  As soon as I applied the Wonder Salve, the scar disappeared the next day.  Love this product and I intend to always keep a supply of it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for relief of pain with shingles for a relative.. did not work at all. Do not recommend for shingles pain.  Have not used it for anything else.</li>
    <li> Like everyone says, this does stain everything---even your skin/shingles/hives---so bad that I had to stop using it because I couldn&#x27;t tell if my hives were getting better because my skin was stained a dark brown---looked like I had bruises all over my body. I&#x27;m going to say it doesn&#x27;t work, although, there was a nice warming quality when I used it, but Calamine spray works just as good with no mess.</li>
    <li> Great product that helped with shingles pain and to heal the rash.  only downside is that the stuff is dark brown and will stain clothing - so be sure to wear an old shirt.  there is a warning on the package about staining - which is nice.  Highly recommend this wonder-salve for people with shingles - this will help you.</li>
    <li> Wonder Salve was indeed helpful to our daughter who had the shingles. It alleviated pain and assisted in an early healing.</li>
    <li> Not exactly the miracle cream that these 5 stars are saying it is, but I can&#x27;t deny how well this works. It didn&#x27;t get rid of 100% of my pain or itching, but it helped tremendously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll still get itching and occasionally a spike of pain, but this does provide relief, even if it isn&#x27;t instant like they claim in the description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have shingles, you really don&#x27;t have many options, take your anti-inflammatory, take your anti-virals, and just wait it out. Add this to the concoction and you should have a relatively pain and itch-free experience. As long as you&#x27;re not trying to sleep...</li>
    <li> Product was hard to apply to sore area and stained clothing.  Disappointed.and would not recommend to shingles sufferers.  May work for other people but didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> My husband searched on Goodle  for relief from  shingles.  That is when he came across Durhams&#x27;s Bee Farm  Wonder-Salve.  I ordered the product over-night, When I received Durham&#x27;s Wonder-Salve it started to work on the first application. That night I was able to sleep through my first night in over a week. Since then every day is a better day and This Wonder -Salves works and I thank Durham&#x27;s Bee Farm and there Bees for me relief.  They may not be doctors but they do have a product that works. And PS I will spread the word of this product to all that I know.  Leona L Clough</li>
    <li> It does contain petroleum jelly, but the texture and smell is very nice.  I use it as lip balm and it is slightly colored, so it looks good too.</li>
    <li> The reviews I read of this were so amazing, that I should have known better.  I know I will end up using it over time, but please note...if you are using it on something like shingles, or a rash, it doesn&#x27;t work instantly, and doesn&#x27;t completely shut down the rash.</li>
    <li> I like that it did help me with my issue but the product is VERY sticky! I mean VERY! and it also has a strong odor and the color is dark brown so I dont recommend using it when going to sleep since your pillow cover may get messy!</li>
    <li> This is my second jar it is wonderful.. My husband had shingles and it really helped with the pain.I plan to keep it in the house because it will help itching etc</li>
    <li> When I purchase this, they only listed the natural ingredients on the Amazon site below:&lt;br /&gt;Important Information:&lt;br /&gt;Indications&lt;br /&gt;to effectively treat shingles, psoriasis, and eczema skin conditions.&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Propolis, Aloe Vera and Goldenseal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However when I received this product, and read the ingredient. It also contains petroleum jelly, mineral oil and isopropyl myristate.</li>
    <li> I got this for one of my sons who has very bad eczema and when item arrived I opened it and just rub a little on my finger and put that amount on a rash I was getting. Well the next morning the redness was gone and the rash was much better so I ordered another one for me. My son says it is helping  his skin which was all raw and infected from the eczema but it is getting better and not worst.</li>
    <li> Hubby had a milder case, but indicated immediate relief from the itching with this salve.  Highly recommended!!!  A little goes a very long way too!</li>
    <li> This was supposed to be great to help with the itching from shingles. It did nothing!!!! Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> The bee&#x27;s wax was not effective in eliminating the pain resulting from shingles.  Maybe&lt;br /&gt;it helps the lesions, but it did not help the resulting nerve pain.</li>
