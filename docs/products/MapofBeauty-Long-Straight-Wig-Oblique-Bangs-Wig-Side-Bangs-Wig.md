      <li>Its so pretty!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty though!</li>
      <li>The piece is priced just right for a costume wig and</li>
      <li>Most wigs have to be trained, cut or fixed and this one feels real.  </li>
      <li>Thanks so much Taobaopit!!</li>
      <li>Makes anyone mysterious and sexy.</li>
      <li>I find it just as pretty at one length.</li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t exactly buy it because of that</li>
      <li>I loved the color of the wig but it sheaded a lot and it was not good for everyday wear if u want to wear her maybe every now and then again great</li>
      <li>loved the style, but wig cap was too small, wig slide on head,</li>
      <li>really suites my face, for this reason I wil wear it until it wears out.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t bother if your planning to wear it out in the real world.</li>
      <li>Not for everyday wear because it tangles very easy.</li>
      <li>The color looks just like the photo, and it is silky and soft.. feels just like real hair!  </li>
      <li>The wig is a little more of a cranberry color than the product picture implies</li>
      <li>I was so surprised ,when my wine red, straight wig came SO fast!</li>
      <li>but I can live with it.</li>
      <li>Plus, it came 10 days early.</li>
      <li>The bangs are too long and are in the way too much.</li>
      <li>I bought other wigs from the same seller in the same order and other models were made with a better fiber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The cap is a full cap made of mesh, I find this cap style hard to adjust as it is not stretchy except for the circumference.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really soft and long.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s all one length, and I mean REALLY long!</li>
<li> The bangs are also a little longer, but I will cut them anyway.</li>
<li> the hair was all knatted and the head peice of it had a chunk of hair missing.</li>
<li> that your average Halloween wig, and at least half the price.</li>
<li> Your company never lets me down!!</li>
<li> The bangs need a little trimming, at least for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Its a little on the thin side, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br</li>
<li> It is a dark red wine color, but the rest is crap.</li>
<li> A little thin but not too bad for what I paid.</li>
<li> For the price I paid I was expecting to be a little disappointed.</li>
<li> The quality of the wig was bad.</li>

    <li> I haven&#x27;t actually worn this out yet because it sheds a lot. It&#x27;s not as comfortable as some other wigs I&#x27;ve tried and the hairstyle sits weird on my head. The bangs are also too long and because of the way the hair falls, I doubt trimming them will work. It&#x27;s pretty though!</li>
    <li> It arrived on its estimated arrival date in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;It sheds a little, but that&#x27;s expected considering the price. Its a little on the thin side, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very nice cut, not too shiny and it came with a wig cap which was nice.&lt;br /&gt;I love love love it. Its so pretty!</li>
    <li> It is a very inexpensive wig, but the quality is not good. It sheds a LOT. I bought it from seller TaoBaoPit. The bangs need a little trimming, at least for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came all tangled, and the ends of the longer layer were damaged. The cap is a full cap made of mesh, I find this cap style hard to adjust as it is not stretchy except for the circumference. It slides backwards a lot while wearing, I had to sew in a couple clips for hair extensions along the front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed it with wig shampoo and It had massive shedding. I didn&#x27;t combed it while wet, but there were lots of hairs left in the basin. After drying it looked better than before, but the fiber is very tangly. I bought other wigs from the same seller in the same order and other models were made with a better fiber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the color, it&#x27;s beautiful and really suites my face, for this reason I wil wear it until it wears out. But I think that will be soon...  a shame...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price this is an amazing wig for a costume or a party, but not for frequent use. It took a month to arrive u.u just in Halloween actually ¬¬ I had no time to wash it before wearing... and I had the sliding problem...</li>
    <li> Great for a toy for a kid&#x27;s dress up or maybe theater - not for actual wear.</li>
    <li> I was so surprised ,when my wine red, straight wig came SO fast! it only took 11 days! I was so excited, and opened  my package up, in about 10 seconds! Oh my gosh!! This wig is so gorgeous! The color looks just like the photo, and it is silky and soft.. feels just like real hair!  It isn&#x27;t layered ,as in the photo.., which actually, I&#x27;m glad. It&#x27;s all one length, and I mean REALLY long! I put it on, and the color and style is SO flattering!!  Wow!I think this is now my favorite wig , And, I have about 20! Thanks so much Taobaopit!! Your company never lets me down!! :) :)</li>
    <li> The quality of the wig was bad. the hair was all knatted and the head peice of it had a chunk of hair missing. it just didnt look like the picture at all!!</li>
    <li> This is so pretty :) The one thing was it wasn&#x27;t layered like it is shown but I didn&#x27;t exactly buy it because of that I find it just as pretty at one length. The bangs were quite long and instead of pushing them off to the side, I swept them over my forehead and it looked beautiful. I would definately recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> Looks better on the pictures then for real.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t take this seriuosly. The bangs are too long and are in the way too much.It is a dark red wine color, but the rest is crap. Don&#x27;t bother if your planning to wear it out in the real world.</li>
    <li> The wig is in very great condition and the color is beautiful. It is as described and I love it.</li>
    <li> loved the style, but wig cap was too small, wig slide on head, no combs to keep wig in place, tangles and knots easily</li>
    <li> Fantastic for the price. Wig had no stretch to it, however. Be warned.</li>
    <li> I love the color and quality of this wig. Just received it today! All I need to do is cut the bangs shorter and it will be perfect for my cosplay!!</li>
    <li> I received this wigs, with 2 others that I didn&#x27;t like, but this one was OK. The color is a lighter red than pictured. The bangs are also a little longer, but I will cut them anyway. Plus, it came 10 days early. Not the best wig ever, but it&#x27;s decent.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really soft and long. Not for everyday wear because it tangles very easy. It is heat safe and can be styled just as easy as real hair. The cap it comes with is very nice too. A little thin but not too bad for what I paid. Also came before the expected date. Overall its a pretty good buy :)</li>
    <li> The wig will not last all that long (heavy shed), but the color and cut is far nicer than the picture. The bangs could not be more perfect. no trim needed.</li>
    <li> The piece is priced just right for a costume wig and the color is gorgeous. The seller was very polite and excellent to do business with.</li>
    <li> This wig was able to be worn right out of the box.  Most wigs have to be trained, cut or fixed and this one feels real.  I am very happy with it.  It also came an entire month earlier than expected.</li>
    <li> The color is fantastic and matches the photo.  However from the second I took it out of its packaging it began to shed.  Get what you pay for I guess.</li>
    <li> For the price I paid I was expecting to be a little disappointed. However I was very happy with the quality of this wig! It has a good amount of hair. The wig is a little more of a cranberry color than the product picture implies but I can live with it. Much much better quality that your average Halloween wig, and at least half the price. :)</li>
    <li> I loved the color of the wig but it sheaded a lot and it was not good for everyday wear if u want to wear her maybe every now and then again great but the a heading</li>
    <li> Very nice quality, and it&#x27;s been many months it&#x27;s holding up well.</li>
    <li> This wig color and length is so cool!  Love it.  Makes anyone mysterious and sexy.</li>
    <li> For the price of the product it is in very good condition and fits wonderfully than some other seller&#x27;s wigs. I rather like how it fits and the quality of the product though the wig is a tiny bit darker than it appears in the picture it is still fantastic and an excellent buy. Taobaopit is also very friendly and has wonderful communication about all their products and willing to do whatever they can to make sure the buyer is satisfied with their product too.</li>
