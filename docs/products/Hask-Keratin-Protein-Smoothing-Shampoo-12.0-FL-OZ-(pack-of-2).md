### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Plus I was out of my Cliniqie face primer (flawless skin when used)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
      <li>Great product</li>
      <li>It does however make a good shaving cream, lol</li>
      <li>If anybody has any suggestions as to what might be a good product to use after these, please let me know.</li>
      <li>It is good stuff.</li>
      <li>Let me begin with saying I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
      <li>and Im soooo glad I did!</li>
      <li>The pros of this brand is that it smells nice</li>
      <li>The smell of this is so nice</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair</li>
      <li>OMG this is far my favorite shampoo/conditioner I have ever used!!!</li>
      <li>I love hask.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I ordered both.</li>
      <li>Anyhow, as added protection I also use the Keritan Oil treatment before blow drying and the combination of both products make for an even better solution to my funky, heat tortured hair.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>Love the shampoo and the conditioner.&lt;br</li>
      <li>LOVE THIS BRAND AND HELP MY HAIR GROW</li>
      <li>but I love the conditioner.</li>
      <li>They have been okay.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good product because it makes your hair much softer and shiner.  </li>
      <li>My hair are smooth and silky than before.</li>
      <li>I get that I&#x27;m offered free two day shipping</li>
      <li>Soft after one wash, my hair is becoming healthy again.</li>
      <li>They do a good job but just don&#x27;t go far enough.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll most likely pay the additional money to have it brought directly to my door because I love the product so much.</li>
      <li>Very reasonably priced shampoo that does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair soft and silky smooth, plus the shine...</li>
      <li>Must try shampoo first.</li>
      <li>but once it does, it is unruly even though it&#x27;s soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I would order more in the future if I needed it.</li>
      <li>My hair literally fell straight.  </li>
      <li>really??</li>
      <li>I love how soft it left my hair and how supple it was.</li>
      <li>I have been using a different protein shampoo &amp; conditioner on my fine, naturally wavy hair.</li>
      <li>Well, as most women, I tend to wait until the very last minute to re-order my products, leaving me in a bind and having to run to the store last minute because my shipment won&#x27;t be in until Friday.</li>
      <li>It gave a new look to my hair.</li>
      <li>I have a Brazilian Keratin treatment on my hair and have tried several different suflate  free shampoos.  </li>
      <li>I know a lot of women use protein products to help smooth or help with straightening hair, but I have found they help my waves (reduce frizz and don&#x27;t weigh them down).</li>
      <li>I have very thick coarse hair and have never found a conditioner that detangles my hair and leaves it as soft and manageable as this one did, not to mention it smells good too.</li>
      <li>leaves hair soft even after a coloring your hair</li>
      <li>well, it wasn&#x27;t fixed</li>
      <li>This product is okay, not very impressed.</li>
      <li>Back to my old products because they work.</li>
      <li>I let my hair dry naturally</li>

<li> I let my hair dry naturally</li>
<li> While I do recommend it, I just wish it was a bit stronger in the frizz protect part because the weather, where I live, is a mix of crazy: humidity goes from high to low; heat is very high (during Mid-Spring through Mid-Fall); and makes it seem like I never comb my hair.  </li>
<li> and it&#x27;s not chock full of nasty chemical ingredients like many shampoo &amp; conditioning products.</li>
<li> /&gt;Though the shampoo alone leaves my hair kinda dry</li>
<li> I have dry unmanageable hair and have difficulty finding products that help it, but I have no complaints about the Hask Keratin Protein smoothing shampoo &amp; conditioner.  </li>
<li> both products did nothing to help repair my dry hair..</li>
<li> I blow dry my hair every day to straighten it as I  have this kinda funky partial wave going on.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used the conditioner in the pink packet.</li>
<li> I would not buy again due to the price and the results.</li>
<li> I have bought other Keratin products from cheaper brands and they make my hair softer than this shampoo/conditioner.</li>
<li> I have very dry, long, thick hair.</li>
<li> and it just left my hair feeling icky.</li>
<li> However, this still weighed down my hair a bit and didn&#x27;t control frizz.</li>
<li> This is not a magic system that works for dry, damaged hair.</li>
<li> I was hoping this would work because it&#x27;s much less cheaper than the products I am using, but I guess I won&#x27;t be saving money.</li>
<li> but thought it would make my hair a little softer after I used it.</li>
<li> a waste of money</li>
<li> They finally fixed it, but now my hair is so dry that as soon as it touches any shampoo, it tangles so badly that even putting tons of conditioner for up to 10min won&#x27;t work.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been having trouble with frizzy hair lately and this has been helping a little bit with that.  </li>
<li> and I&#x27;m lazy to the point of not wanting to run into the store, and it&#x27;s a convenience factor, but come on..8 freaking dollars...</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m somewhat lazy.</li>
<li> I might try something else, not sure yet.</li>
<li> i think the products are fake the shampoo and conditionador were open 👺</li>
<li> But not too bad overall!</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure why this was so bad with all the reviews.</li>
<li> You just can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
<li> , Ill buy it again just for that!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I did not purchase this product from Amazon but I saw it at my Local beauty supply on sale and decided to try it out. I haven&#x27;t tried the shampoo but I love the conditioner. I have very thick coarse hair and have never found a conditioner that detangles my hair and leaves it as soft and manageable as this one did, not to mention it smells good too.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo and the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Though the shampoo alone leaves my hair kinda dry but the conditioner makes up for it.My hair are smooth and silky than before.</li>
    <li> The smell of this is so nice, Ill buy it again just for that!</li>
    <li> I have been using a different protein shampoo &amp; conditioner on my fine, naturally wavy hair. I know a lot of women use protein products to help smooth or help with straightening hair, but I have found they help my waves (reduce frizz and don&#x27;t weigh them down). The pros of this brand is that it smells nice and it&#x27;s not chock full of nasty chemical ingredients like many shampoo &amp; conditioning products.

    <li> OMG this is far my favorite shampoo/conditioner I have ever used!!! I tried Loreal, Redken,Garnier,etc and this has made my over processed hair manageable and softer! I got highlights on my hair...I didn&#x27;t like it so I went back the next week to fix it...well, it wasn&#x27;t fixed so I went to another salon the next month. They finally fixed it, but now my hair is so dry that as soon as it touches any shampoo, it tangles so badly that even putting tons of conditioner for up to 10min won&#x27;t work. I tried deep conditioning it, putting olive oil, masking it with home made oils mixed, etc...nothing. Then a lady at the store saw me comparing brand by brand for 30min and told me this helped her a lot. I gave it a try and Im soooo glad I did!</li>
    <li> I have a Brazilian Keratin treatment on my hair and have tried several different suflate  free shampoos.  They have been okay.  I then tried this and I was amazed.  My hair literally fell straight.  I even took it to my stylist to try and she was amazed!  She&#x27;s ditching her salon brand for this!</li>
    <li> Saved my hair from the nightmares of bleach. Soft after one wash, my hair is becoming healthy again.</li>
    <li> I have dry unmanageable hair and have difficulty finding products that help it, but I have no complaints about the Hask Keratin Protein smoothing shampoo &amp; conditioner.  They do a good job but just don&#x27;t go far enough.  I let my hair dry naturally but once it does, it is unruly even though it&#x27;s soft and smooth.  Not all products are for everybody, so I don&#x27;t feel that I can speak for anybody but myself about this shampoo &amp; conditioner.  If anybody has any suggestions as to what might be a good product to use after these, please let me know.</li>
    <li> Very reasonably priced shampoo that does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner repaired my split ends and gave my hair body. I would recommend the product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great product but thought it would make my hair a little softer after I used it. I have bought other Keratin products from cheaper brands and they make my hair softer than this shampoo/conditioner. I would not buy again due to the price and the results. This is not a magic system that works for dry, damaged hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product because it makes your hair much softer and shiner.  I&#x27;ve been having trouble with frizzy hair lately and this has been helping a little bit with that.  While I do recommend it, I just wish it was a bit stronger in the frizz protect part because the weather, where I live, is a mix of crazy: humidity goes from high to low; heat is very high (during Mid-Spring through Mid-Fall); and makes it seem like I never comb my hair.  I might try something else, not sure yet. Still deciding.  But not too bad overall!</li>
    <li> i think the products are fake the shampoo and conditionador were open 👺</li>
    <li> I received these both today. I&#x27;ve used the conditioner in the pink packet. It&#x27;s wonderful. I love how soft it left my hair and how supple it was. I kept buying packets of it thinking, there&#x27;s got to be a bottle set somewhere. I found it here. I&#x27;m glad I ordered both. I love hask. It is good stuff. I would order more in the future if I needed it. But, not on a weekly basis no. Perhaps monthly I could. Must try shampoo first. I will update this review after trying the shampoo.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS BRAND AND HELP MY HAIR GROW BUT WAS ALSO USING THE PROTEIN DEEP CONDITTONER DISPLAY TREATMENT AS WELL.</li>
    <li> Let me begin with saying I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! It did/does as one reviewer said, and repaired my split ends! It leaves my hair soft and silky smooth, plus the shine... You just can&#x27;t go wrong here. I blow dry my hair every day to straighten it as I  have this kinda funky partial wave going on. It&#x27;s yuck. Anyhow, as added protection I also use the Keritan Oil treatment before blow drying and the combination of both products make for an even better solution to my funky, heat tortured hair. The reason for 4⭐️..... Well, as most women, I tend to wait until the very last minute to re-order my products, leaving me in a bind and having to run to the store last minute because my shipment won&#x27;t be in until Friday. Plus I was out of my Cliniqie face primer (flawless skin when used) and figured I would just stop in ULTA on my way home and grab the two. Well wouldn&#x27;t you know the shampoo and conditioner combined was cheaper there as opposed to Amazon. I&#x27;m no talking a buck or two. Close to $8.00 cheaper. I get that I&#x27;m offered free two day shipping and I&#x27;m lazy to the point of not wanting to run into the store, and it&#x27;s a convenience factor, but come on..8 freaking dollars...really?? Oh well. Either way I&#x27;ll most likely pay the additional money to have it brought directly to my door because I love the product so much. and I&#x27;m somewhat lazy.</li>
    <li> I have very dry, long, thick hair. I have not noticed any improvement. After using this product for a month, my hair has shown no difference.</li>
    <li> leaves hair soft even after a coloring your hair</li>
    <li> This product is okay, not very impressed.</li>
    <li> both products did nothing to help repair my dry hair.. a waste of money</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. It gave a new look to my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this was so bad with all the reviews. I have very fine hair and it just left my hair feeling icky. It does however make a good shaving cream, lol</li>
