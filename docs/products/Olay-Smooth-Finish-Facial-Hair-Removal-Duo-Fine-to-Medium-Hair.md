      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I will be using this for years to come and the price is amazing as well.</li>
      <li>One thing that does help is I use a washcloth and kind of scrub my lip after I remove the product.</li>
      <li>and it kind of has a yucky smell that stays with you for a while.</li>
      <li>If you do - its at your own risk.  </li>
      <li>I washed my face with warm water, and couldn&#x27;t stand the burning or redness, so I applied alcohol-free aloe vera to soothe it.</li>

      <li>It is kind of pricey</li>
      <li>She liked it, and it did not irritate her skin in any way.</li>

      <li>The clear hasn&#x27;t yellowed, the case hasn&#x27;t cracked and my phone is still in perfect condition.</li>
      <li>mineral/petroleum jelly stick is a nice idea, and after the removal creme is gone, I imagine it will make a lovely cuticle</li>
      <li>So far, this one is the best.</li>
      <li>WORKS PERFECT ON SENSITIVE SKIN, DIDNT REDDEN</li>
      <li>Best i have used thus far with no burning or redness</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Loved it, would buy again</li>
    <li> I have very coarse facial hair.  Doesn&#x27;t remove all of it on the first try...but, works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried...without the skin damage and irritation.</li>
    <li> Left stubble behind.  Not smooth at all.  Would have been better off if I had just shaved.  Great if you want to use every three days.</li>
    <li> This product is the best one I&#x27;ve tried.  I wish I could find something that removes the hair forever, but that just doesn&#x27;t happen with a topical product.  This one does a pretty good job of removing hair on my upper lip and chin.  It does cause some burning sensation and redness, but I use a rash cream on it afterwards and everything is back to normal within about an hour.  I usually use it at night so my skin has all night to recover before putting on makeup the next day.  That&#x27;s probably not necessary, but I do it anyway.  If you have a lot of hairs on the chin, you&#x27;ll probably find a few leftovers that have to be pulled out, but better than trying to tweeze all of them.</li>
    <li> I used this product to remove those wacky chin hairs that show up after you become a \\&quot;woman of a certain age\\&quot;.  I read the directions carefully and found a youtube review before using and everything went according to plan.  I will say that it is important to apply the skin guard balm as directed.  I missed a spot or two and suffered some mild irritation that was soothed by the use of Aloe Vera gel.  It lasted about 4 or 5 days before I begin to see the hairs return.  I will definitely use it again and it will be a part of my regular beauty regimen.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years.  It is the easiest and least messy product I have ever used.  I tried several other methods.  My skin is sensitive and becomes a bit irritated if I do not follow the directions carefully.  I use this every two weeks and am very satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> Works on most of the fine hairs but does not remove the coarse hairs.  Save your money, as it is not worth it.</li>
    <li> I have course, dark hair. It works great and is fast and easy to use. I would highly recommend versus other methods.</li>
    <li> OK - pleasant fragrance, easy to use but re growth back in just a week so not much difference to using razor.</li>
    <li> This product is good but not great. I wanted a longer lasting effect than just a few days. It does what it is supposed to do. My face felt really smooth after using this.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work to we&#x27;ll on chin hair.</li>
    <li> This is probably my favorite product for hair removal. It really does remove all the hair and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I can usually wait a week before I need to do a touch up with tweezers, and a full two weeks before using it again. Great if you want at-home hair removal for the price.</li>
    <li> I love this Hair Removal! It doesn&#x27;t burn me and smells good.</li>
    <li> Olay smooth finish facial hair removal duo is perfect for the fine hairs that began growing on my face.  I use it about every 8-10 weeks and it&#x27;s very easy to do.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great! I would recommend this product to any women. It leaves your skin feeling soft and the product just wipes away.</li>
    <li> This is the worst produch I swear, My face was red and burning like crazy after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;USELESS, PAINFUL AND WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
    <li> Product worked well. No burning or redness I&#x27;d use it again</li>
    <li> I was hoping this was the holy grail I&#x27;d been looking for, but alas... still didn&#x27;t work for my coarse hair. I&#x27;ve tried everything on my chin, I have unfortunate coarse hair there... and nothing works. I&#x27;ve tried every cream, and wax, nothing makes a dent. I gave this two stars because it did actually remove SOME hair, which is more  than anything else ever has... but it was a comically small amount. I followed directions to the letter, and left it on for the maximum amount recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks like I&#x27;ll be spending some money on laser removal.. so thanks Olay for finally getting me to the point where i&#x27;m desperate enough to try that route (i guess?)</li>
    <li> This product did not remove my hairs at all. Don&#x27;t understand how it can work for some and not for others. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Sally Hansen works for me and is a lot cheaper!</li>
    <li> I have dealt with facial hair for a long long time.  I have done everything from laser hair removal to waxing every 4 weeks.  I saw this online and decided to give it a shot.  Last night, I tried with my upper lip.  I was surprised with how well it worked!  Surely it couldn&#x27;t work this well on the &amp;#34;tree trunks&amp;#34; that I had on my chin.  So I tried it out.  It left a few super short ones (I pluck them daily), but otherwise was great.  Used it this morning on my cheeks on the peach fuzz, and once again, like perfection!  Much cheaper than waxing, and I can do it on home!</li>
    <li> This product worked but it does not work better than the 4 dollar sally henson or 5 dollar veet. Its not worth the extra money with those products on the market. Also I don&#x27;t find the protector worth it. If anything it prohibits the product from working and the product alone does not burn my skin.</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly! No irritation!</li>
    <li> The product is ok, I wish it would actually work within the 5-10 minute time frame they advertise. I usually have to leave it on for about 15 minutes to make sure that the hair is all removed.</li>
    <li> This is a great product however I am allergic to it.  Product does what is says</li>
    <li> It is so easy to use. I was really impressed. I read directions carefully, including pre-testing instructions. Worked like a charm and takes only 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give this product zero stars if I could. It did literally nothing to remove my facial hair. Even though the directions said to wait three days before using it again, I tried it one day later hoping that two treatments back-to-back might work together to yield better results. No improvement. I have no reason to believe that my facial hair is any different than anyone else&#x27;s. I cancelled my subscription and I&#x27;m trying eflora, an OTC version of Vaniqua, hoping at least to slow the hair growth. Reviews rate it very highly and it&#x27;s available through Amazon at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Not only did it not remove the hair, it burned me as well! Followed the directions EXACTLY.  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all. Don&#x27;t do it. The burn was 100xs worse than waxing.</li>
    <li> Gain olay products are the bomb!</li>
    <li> Worked well on soft hair but failed to remove coarse hairs.</li>
    <li> Been living with facial hair for a long time. I have tweezed, creamed, waxed and tried every gimmick out there. I have just faced the fact that It is just part of my routine and have found that this product works the best out there. It did a great job, and yes you have to pluck a few hairs that it leaves. My sensitive skin was not irritated  and my face felt very soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin so these types of creams always leave my face red and tender. This doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all thanks to the salve stick that goes on before the cream! I do need to leave the cream on a bit longer than recommended to get tougher hairs (ladies know which ones I&#x27;m referring to). But the peach fuzz is easily removed in the appropriate time. This is the FIRST cream I have used that I was happy with in over 10 yrs. The only reason I gave it 4 stars, is that I do have to leave it on longer to get course hairs which I didn&#x27;t realize the first couple of tries, so ended up plucking. But if the undercoat is used properly there was no burn for me.</li>
    <li> The best ever and lasts quite awhile.  I love it and will buy it again.  Not harsh, no redness; easy to apply.  Excellent product, much better than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  Does not leave you red.</li>
    <li> I love this product it really works great it doesn&#x27;t burn you face. Would recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay not clean and clear like waxing or threading .. I don&#x27;t like it</li>
    <li> Very effective at removing facial hair, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.</li>
    <li> This product works exactly as described. Use as directed and it works great..</li>
    <li> I have very dark, course hair; thus, facial hair is an issue. Unfortunately, though not common to those of us with dark, course hair, I also have highly sensitive skin. For years I have suffered through products that have either left the hair behind or burned the top layer of my skin, leaving it red and blotchy at best, or sore and peeling at worst. Thankfully, that is not the case with this product. I followed the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions to the letter and was left with soft, smooth, hairless skin! (I did feel a slight tingle right before the 8 minute mark, but everything was fine once I removed the product.) I would highly recommend this product. On a side note I&#x27;d like to add my 13 year old daughter suffers with the same issues I described above; however, due to her age, I&#x27;m always hesitant about what products I let her try. I will have no problems letting her use this product.</li>
    <li> It seems to work okay. Better than some others I&#x27;ve tried. My hair is very fine.</li>
    <li> This facial hair remover does a good job of removing hair.  I got three uses out of the one package.  Probably about 3-4 months in between uses.  I don&#x27;t normally have sensitive skin but about 1 1/2 weeks after it&#x27;s been done my face has broken out pretty bad.  I have actually had better luck with Sally Hansen products.  Won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> This product works better than any other I have tried and lasts longer. It also doesn&#x27;t smell horrible which is a huge bonus.</li>
    <li> WORKS PERFECT ON SENSITIVE SKIN, DIDNT REDDEN MUCH AT ALL ONLY DURING THE WARM RINSE AND PAT DRY STEP, because when you rub off with tissue, rag, or cotton ball, you then rinse with warm water which shows up rosy at that point on your skin. As soon as you pat dry, it should calm down within seconds</li>
    <li> I  used this product exactly according to the directions and it did&#x27;nt dissolve or remove coarse hair from my face.</li>
    <li> Their description of this product did not do what it said</li>
    <li> Works like a charm and I&#x27;m SUPER FREAKING HAIRY!</li>
    <li> Exceeded all expectations, worked great and pain free!! Well worth the money and skin feels great after using, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Kept it on for 6 minutes. Wiped it off. OWWWWWWW!! Intense burning for over an hour and only a cool wash cloth gave some relief. The hair is gone, but it left me with small rash that lasted a couple days in one spot. I don&#x27;t think I could endure it again. Well, now that the initial pain is over and the hair is gone....maybe... I&#x27;ll just leave it on for 4 minutes. Maybe. Gave it 3 stars because of the pain.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and really suffered when I used Sally Hansen, but it was the least caustic of anything I could find until I found this. Olay worked great the first time and I thought I was in Heaven. No pain, no rash and it worked great, but the second time it wasn&#x27;t as great. I had a few small burned areas and some slight pain, but I reread the directions and realized I hadn&#x27;t spread the balm evenly or over a large enough area. Now, I am very methodical about spreading the balm and being sure I cover the area completely and evenly plus I apply it well past the area I want to treat, and have had great results. I have even used it the same day and worn makeup right after treatment. I have fine light hair over most of cheeks, chin, neck and above my lips with a few black coarse hairs here and there. Sometimes I might have to pluck a few of the black hairs, but I find if I remove the cream against the direction of the hair growth I have less plucking. Probably won&#x27;t work for everyone and it is really expensive in comparison to other cream removers and a pretty small tube that only gives me two or three applications at the most, since I cover a large area, but it looks like it might be coming down a little in price and I still use the Sally Hansens on my arms since they aren&#x27;t as sensitive like my face. I have had this facial hair since I was very young and have always been insecure about it, so for me the extra expense is not a deterent for me, since I finally have some sense of normality now. Good luck!</li>
    <li> I do not think it is  as effective as less expensive products ,and it is more complicated to use, since there are two steps .</li>
    <li> After reading all the directions and warnings, I opted not to use this product on my face.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this product. After some experimentation with timing and amount of the remover, these are the adjustments that worked for me (oily, medium-to-olive skin, combination of fine and coarse hair).&lt;br /&gt;1. Prepare the area as directed.&lt;br /&gt;2. Spread a thin layer over the area to be treated. Go back and really glob it on, so that the coverage is opaque, like the picture in the leaflet.&lt;br /&gt;3. Wait 12 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;4. Remove with a dry washcloth, rubbing against the grain of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;5. Voila! It&#x27;s done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I follow up by placing a damp, cool washcloth on the area for a few seconds, and have had no redness or irritation.</li>
    <li> Only took off some hair not all of it, so hard to find a product that works</li>
    <li> This works great on my upper lip. I have fine blond hair and it removes it in one application quickly.</li>
    <li> Product was used by my daughter. She liked it, and it did not irritate her skin in any way. This is the first time she has used a product for this purpose. She stated that it did not seem to remove every bit of hair, but there was a difference. maybe needs to repeat, although her problem is not a big one.</li>
    <li> This product is very gentle on the skin as it advertises. However, it removes only the medium hair, leaving the coarse.</li>
    <li> I have some noticeable hair on my chin and tried this product twice as directed and nothing happened.  No hair came off.  It&#x27;s smells weird and isn&#x27;t effective.  Save your money!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and trouble with harsh smells to the point I can&#x27;t wear perfume or even scented deodorant. I also have a few rather course, hormonal whisker like hairs on my chin that are difficult to even tweeze. This stuff worked great, the most difficult hairs were removed easily, the smell was very light and tolerable and there was only a slight tingle, just this side of a burning sensation that left me slightly more sensitive to the touch but not at all red or irritated beyond that. I will be sticking with Olay Smooth Finish.</li>
    <li> Arrived sooner than promised and exactly as expected-thanks</li>
    <li> I have course chin hairs and knew nothing works besides shaving or plucking so I figured I would try this after reading reviews and give it a chance to see if it would be a miracle but I&#x27;m sad to say it didn&#x27;t take even the hair off the surface of my chin, it worked on thinner hair on my cheeks so I like it for that, it&#x27;s not effective enough to remove all the hairs, but again not for my cheeks just my chin hairs so it wasn&#x27;t useful at all.</li>
    <li> This is the first product that I have used over the last forty years, that removes the hair and does not irritate, burn or generally create a sensitive upper lip. And, when it is wiped off, the skin underneath is like a baby&#x27;s bottom. It really gets all of the hair. After removal of other products, when you run your fingers over your lip, the skin still has something there; not completely smooth at all. After applying this product your skin is \\&quot;Sticky\\&quot; soft. don&#x27;t know any other way to describe it. And, you could go right out into the public after using it. There is no redness and no irritation whatsoever. I just love it. After all these years it is about time they got it right. As far as how quickly hair grows back, I don&#x27;t really care. The only reason I cared before, was that your skin got so irritated, you did not want to do it again, too close to the time before. But this could theoretically be used every single day and you would never know the difference. For me, it is every two weeks, before I repeat application. The point of this, is to be able to go out and NOT have people see hair on your upper lip. And, you don&#x27;t want to look like you SANDED your lip in order to get it that way. I am happy with this product.</li>
    <li> The hair remover works but the quantities of face prep &amp; face remover aren&#x27;t balanced for use at the prescribed rate.  I hate that kind of waste.</li>
    <li> It works well on fine hair but not so great on coarse hair.  It was easy to use and did not cause any skin discomfort.</li>
    <li> Amazing and does not irritate my sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> I only use Oil of Olay skin care  products-great price!</li>
    <li> I have very fine blonde hair on my face and this did not even phase it! Still the same as it was before this application. This name brand and high price did not make a difference what-so-ever. Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> It actually worked.  I bought for for my wife.  She calmed this type product doesn&#x27;t work.  She tried it and now uses it.  It isn&#x27;t perfect but it does work.  Suggest getting the coarse hair right off especially if you are older.</li>
    <li> Try this item on my medium to coarse hair and did not like at all. I saw very little difference in the before and after usage. Returned.</li>
    <li> As advertised but not exceptional--I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Any woman that wants an easy in home method to remove facial hair, Olay Smooth Finish Facial Hari Removal Duo is perfect product to use. After watching a few YouTube videos, I finally figured out the perfect technique to using it. I learned to apply the wax lightly over the area you want to remove your hair from and the white cream so it covers your skin. I will likely be a lifetime buyer of this product.</li>
    <li> I lOVe love love olay products, but not this. Here&#x27;s the problem : First they don&#x27;t clear the hair from the root. All it does is dissolve the growth so after a day or two of using it, I get little growth back. There is never a full clean feeling like after plucking. I have tried wiping off the cream firmly with the cotton pads in the hopes that I will get a cleaner result. No luck.  Second, I may be allergic to something in this, I don&#x27;t know but it is really annoying that I get pimples on my chin after using this cream. It is really ironic since I got rid of my acne by using the regenerist serums.</li>
    <li> dosnt get all the hair even if you leave it on for the max 10 min and it kind of has a yucky smell that stays with you for a while.</li>
    <li> Hair type: mostly peach fuzz, some dark thick hairs on upper lip, chin, and jaw line&lt;br /&gt;Skin: medium complexion, normal but sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this at my local drugstore. I have tried every type of hair removal product out there. I receive the best results from waxing but I have very sensitive skin and I break out, so I thought I would try this. I cannot use Nair or Veet, but I read others who were able to use this product but not those 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied it per the directions and didn&#x27;t feel any type of burning sensation like I usually do. I applied a thick layer of the pre-treatment cream. I left it on 8 min then began removing. As soon as I began removing it, it felt like my face was on fire. I had to wipe pretty firmly to remove the hair, and it all came off. I washed my face with warm water, and couldn&#x27;t stand the burning or redness, so I applied alcohol-free aloe vera to soothe it. It helped slightly, but an hour later and my face still feels like its on fire and is extremely red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could be that my skin is ultra sensitive, so if your skin is like mine, take caution in using this product. It will remove all hair, but you might be left with chemical burns.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  It is gentle yet effective and leaves my skin feeling silky smooth! And at the department store it it between 35 and 45 dollars!!!</li>
    <li> This product did not work at all. I was very disappointed for the price that I paid!!! Would not use this again</li>
    <li> This product is a complete waste of time and money.I bought it at wal-mart used it twice and didn&#x27;t Work either time.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and, works well with removing hair without tearing hair out. I would much rather use this rather than waxing!&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be buying this again!</li>
    <li> It is not too messy, doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as some, doesn&#x27;t irritate too much (apply a good coating of the balm first), and isn&#x27;t too expensive compared to other brands.</li>
    <li> It works.  This product does not burn the skin.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had it work yet (I&#x27;ve tried it once on facial hair, will try again soon), but I will attest that this product has caused me zero irritation, so I can&#x27;t complain too much, given that it is in the category of chemical depilatories.</li>
    <li> Not thrilled about this product. Followed the instructions but either my hair is too coarse, or this product does not work.  I have only used this product once.  I will try again, and let you know what.</li>
    <li> Not meant for thick coarse hair I think.  I left on a couple of times a long time to see and all it did was piss my face off.</li>
    <li> Yes, I am in my 50&#x27;s and have &#x27;stray eyebrows&#x27; on my chin.  This product works well when used as directed.  Once a week a grapesized dab spread over the upper lip and another under the chin.  I sit with it for 10 minutes while in the bathtub and wipe clean.  Almost all hairs will be gone.  The last few stubborn ones, I pluck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the &#x27;chapstick&#x27; wax before you use this product really helps for people like me with sensitive skin.  There is a generous supply to go with the tube.  And although the tube is small and (to me) expensive, it lasts me a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had not realized until I started using it regularly how much older that &#x27;invisible&#x27; blonde mustache made me look.</li>
    <li> Using this for several months now. The clear hasn&#x27;t yellowed, the case hasn&#x27;t cracked and my phone is still in perfect condition. It&#x27;s a great case!!</li>
    <li> Only placed this work was on the test patch I did on my arm,in fact it worked very well for that.  Nearly 4 weeks later, I do not have hair in that area.  Did absolutely NOTHING for my mustache or beard-sighhh.</li>
    <li> This is the only depilatory that works on my course Greek upper lip hair. Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t work for the hairs on my chin, but those are easy enough to pluck. I haven&#x27;t noticed much irritation on my lip afterwards. I typically use it for 8 minutes before wiping off. My lip is a little red, but not too bad. I only have to use it every two weeks or so. Very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I had seen this on TV and wanted to try it, but it was too expensive for me.  Then a friend told me about ordering it on Amazon for half the price!  I did and it worked better than any other over the counter item like it that I&#x27;ve tried until now!  TY Oil of Olay and Amazon:)</li>
    <li> I was surprised. It worked.  Not 100%, but it worked better and was less obnoxious then everything else I have tried. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> DID NOT REMOVE ALL HAIR...I DO NOT HAVE ALOT OF HAIR ON MY LOWER CHIN SO I THOUGHT THAT THIS PRODUCT WOULD WORK WELL...IT DIDN&#x27;T!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LINDA</li>
    <li> does what it says and I didn&#x27;t have to be embarrassed at the store - worth the price I paid</li>
    <li> What I love about this product is that it removes the hair completely no matter how short the hair growth is. It does not burn and has no odor. Unfortunately for me it barely lasts 48 hours. After 48 hours the hair starts growing and my upper lip feels very rough from stubble which DOES NOT happen to me after waxing or threading. This is why I can only give this product 2 stars. I have a friend who uses this product and this does not happen to her so it obviously depends on the person. If you are thinking of trying this it is worth a shot. Maybe it will work for you.</li>
    <li> if you dont mind burning the skin off of your eyebrows, then go ahead and try this product. this was used exactly as directed and I ended up with severe burn marks on my face that wouldnt go away for a week. horrible product.</li>
    <li> This is over priced and not for coarse hair at all. It does try to take care of the skin.....but its other claims ate false. My first bad Olay product.</li>
    <li> Came fast and it works perfectly fine.  This product was recommended to me and I now see it works.  Very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> While this worked on the fine hairs on my upper lip, I have some coarse hair on my chin. I chose this one specifically for that area and it did not succeed in removing all of it. I had been using a different brand which didn&#x27;t quite get the job done, but for the cost of the Olay, I might as well continue with the cheaper brand.</li>
    <li> I like it because,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1- It didn&#x27;t give me a rash or itchy feeling after I used it. Maybe a little redness but much better than other stuff I used before.&lt;br /&gt;2- I have an acne prone skin, which is why i am looking for a good hair removal solution that will not increase my acne. So far, this one is the best. waxing is the worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it&#x27;s not really for coarse hair. It just works for medium hair. Beware.</li>
    <li> I am a 42 year old African American. While the product did not irritate my skin, it did no better than products that cost a lot less. Yes it removed the fine layer of hair, won&#x27;t remove coarse hair, but neither will the other products (Hansen and Veet).  The only positive is that is does not smell as bad as others.....it&#x27;s a lot more money for the same results. Once I have used this up I will go back to more reasonable priced products and deal with the smell which goes away after awhile anyway.</li>
    <li> It was effective without burning or damaging my skin. The time needed to work was correct.  I had no trouble removing it, the soothing cream was soothing.</li>
    <li> I bought this to clear my top lip area that I&#x27;ve been tweezing since menopause.  I thought this might be easier and more thorough.  Not only does it &#x27;miss&#x27; hairs, but I had re-growth much more quickly and needed to tweeze anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t re-purchase.</li>
    <li> It worked on all of my fine hair (even though it is meant for med- coarse) and did nothing at all to my medium hair. I will reuse for fine hair but will be turning to another product for med hair.</li>
    <li> works great, just smells really bad. i&#x27;ve tried 2 times already and the tube still has enough for maybe 3 or 4 more times. the hair stays off for maybe 5 days before it starts to grow back.</li>
    <li> About me: I&#x27;m very fair skinned with some light blonde mustache hairs that don&#x27;t bother me too much. My problem area is my chin--I&#x27;ve noticed over the past 5 years I&#x27;ve started to sprout some coarse, dark hairs that seem to regrow quickly. I&#x27;ve been purchasing this cream for a year now and use it every 4-7 days. I leave the cream on about 10 mins.I use tweezers in between applications to pluck to get stubborn dark hairs. I usually need to reorder a new tube every 2 months or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;Works well on fine, blonde hairs and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I actually don&#x27;t even apply the skin protector gel beforehand. Gentler than plucking and gets the fine hairs which my tweezers can&#x27;t seem to grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;Does not work on stubborn, coarse dark hairs. I had some success with these ones when I left the cream past 10 minute recommendation, and followed up immediately with a 2nd round (so basically, I had to increase the recommended time a lot). However, if you are going after the stubborn dark hairs, be prepared to apply every other day since you aren&#x27;t taking them out by the root as you would with plucking or waxing. The cream smells bad and the price is a bit high.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t smell awful or hurt, didn&#x27;t work perfectly but I think I just need to give it another go and I should be fine.</li>
    <li> Product works well and is not harsh.  Takes a little longer than it says on the package but still works in minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Use the coarse version for best results</li>
    <li> I bought the Coarse/Medium box &amp; it didint even touch any of the hair.  I watched quite a few videos about it &amp; read the instructions &amp; applied it to a T, per instructions.  COMPLETE fail!!  The return process was effortles &amp; they promptly returned my $$ so....that wasn&#x27;t a pure waste of my $$.</li>
    <li> This works so well!!!!! Not only does it remove the hair but it does so pain free if you follow the directions. Just make sure you get the balm over the entire area. I missed one spot and it hurt for the next day</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use and does not leave your lip red like some of the other hair removal products.</li>
    <li> Works great. First couple of times did not get really course hair on face, but only need to use about every 8-10 days to keep hair off face.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin smooth and soft and don&#x27;t need to repeat treatment for quite a while.  I am very satisfied and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> This product does not irritate my sensitive skin and it has a low odor when compared to other products I&#x27;ve used, and--it works!</li>
    <li> I use this on a regular basis, I find it to be gentle but effective when used as directed. The price is also right.</li>
    <li> Tried it twice using exact instructions - did not get rid of facial hair, sorry that I spent the money.</li>
    <li> I have tried many products to remove hair from my upper lip but this is the best one I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Being a Olay product I thought this would be a good hair remover to use.  Not so.  This product burned my upper lip and left scarring.  Does not remove hair any better than less expensive over the counter brands on the market.</li>
    <li> The stuff is useless, it is a fraud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert Mattson</li>
    <li> Works just like described! A little goes a long way. Smell is not unpleasant. My sensitive skin has not had any negative reaction over the several times I&#x27;ve used it (although I am very careful to use the balm exactly as directed). Easy to use. Will reorder in the future.</li>
    <li> Like this product and can&#x27;t seem to find it locally for a decent price.</li>
    <li> Meh... It took of all the superfine hairs but still had to tweeze.  Just happy it didn&#x27;t burn like some other reviewers experienced although it was pretty sensitive for a day or 2</li>
    <li> Did not remove chin air as easily as expected; it took additional time; and, it did not last very long.  I was looking for something that might be more tailored to African American, coarse hair.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me at all! I followed the directions to a T on multiple occasions. It did seem to make my skin softer but did not remove any hair. Not worth the price</li>
    <li> If you have major, coarse, black chin hair this product just does not work.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Buy another razor.</li>
    <li> I had tried the Fine-To-Medium removal duo before, but it was not effective enough for me.  So I ordered this kit and it did the trick.  It does not have the smell that other kits have; and I like that you put a barrier down before you put on the actual removal cream on first.  A very effective product from my view point.</li>
    <li> This is gentle, effective product for facial hair removal.  It works fast and efficiently.  This far out performs other products that I have used.</li>
    <li> I have both fine hair and weird coarse hair on my upper lip.This is the only thing I have tried that removed all hair. So far there is no rash or irritation.</li>
    <li> Good product that does not irritate my skin as much as others.</li>
    <li> OMG.....I am happily surprised.  I was leery of trying this like many because they never work right and stink horribly.  There is a faint smell, but nothing that will scorch your nostrils.  Upper lip it worked like a dream so I went and tried the chin area.  I have some of those horrid thick grizzly &amp;#34;man&amp;#34; hairs on my chin that I have to pluck continuously.  It did take the longer ones out, but the shorter ones that had been plucked most recently stubbornly stayed.  It is much like waxing on that point, let the hairs grow out some for better results.  Overall I am pleased, I would definitely recommend it, and I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t take off the course hair I have on my chin.  Sure it would work for fine hair, but definitely not for course hair.</li>
    <li> IT worked about as well as any other hair removal product I&#x27;ve tried like this. Which is to say, not very well at all. I have super dark, thick hair that grows in on my chin/neck/cheeks and it got some of it, and did thin what it didn&#x27;t get, but it didn&#x27;t remove it completely, even though I left it on for the full recommended length. It also didn&#x27;t last any longer than shaving</li>
    <li> Great product for hair removal I recommended I use the wax and I actually got a scar from it on my face I have very sensitive skin so I only leave it on for eight minutes even though the hair is very thick I recommend this product</li>
    <li> Have used 2 times so far. First time used exactly as directed and second time without the balm. Allowed 10 minutes both times. Both times the product did not remove coarse hair. Did remove the fine/medium hairs but all coarse hairs were left or broken off right at skin level so looks like stubble. Not worth the price to me and I will not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This Olay facial hair removal lit works well for hair removal..I use it weekly and it removes facial hair while leaving your face feeling smooth.</li>
    <li> This cream works good, the best i&#x27;ve tired for facial hair removal. My upper lip can be sensitive to waxing, so I prefer a cream.</li>
    <li> Did not work only removed some hair and you can still feel stubble.I let it stay on for 12 minutes</li>
    <li> I bought the Fine to Medium one first and it didn&#x27;t work on my darker/coarse hair, so I bought this one.  I tried it for the first time today and I was pleasantly surprised to see most of those little dark hairs wipe off on my cotton pad!  I think I&#x27;ll have to put a bit more cream on some of them next time since not all came off, but at least this product worked on some so far.  I may have used too much of the grease stick.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I used to wax all the time but this is so much easier. Never has made my skin irritated. Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something that works on coarse hair and the reviews on this were good. I thought it was a bit pricey, but if it works, I don&#x27;t mind spending the extra money compared to other products.  It works great on fine to medium hair....extremely pleased with that. However, it did nothing for the coarse hair. I tried it one day and then 2 days later and it didn&#x27;t work any better on coarse hair even leaving it on for 10 minutes. After cleaning it off, you could still feel where the hairs were and the next day I could use a tweezers again.  Needless to say, I was very disappointed since that&#x27;s the main reason I purchased the product.  I will continue to use since it works so well on the fine to medium hair, but doubt that I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this product.  I tried the medium to coarse hair this time and got the same result.  It left stubble and I had to tweeze after use. I left it on for a full ten minutes.  I don&#x27;t think my hair is especially coarse because Sally Hansen works just fine.  I trust the Olay brand and that is why despite its $27 cost I gave it a second chance.  I also like the pre-treat idea which SH does not offer but it is just petroleum jelly.  Good idea though.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin.  I have reactions with waxing and depilatories nearly every time I use them.  I prefer threading.. hurts but it works with no skin reaction (beyond a little temporary redness).  When threading isn&#x27;t an option.. this does the trick.  It removes the hair in 8 minutes with only a little irritation/burning.  MUCH less than Nair. Downside is the hair grows back in stubbly and sooner than with threading or waxing. But it&#x27;s definitely the best depilatory I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> It only takes off the surface hair, not the root as expected.  I have to redo every 7-8 days, but it does not make me break out at all.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much difference between using the Medium to Coarse duo and the Fine to Medium duo. The really coarse hairs are more difficult and only 50% or so are removed.  The fine to medium hairs are easily removed.  My point is that you can use either of the two products for fine, medium, and/or coarse hairs with basically the same results.</li>
    <li> So, yes sometimes us women have to admit to embarrassing facial heir, lol. Well, I have searched around and tried many many different products. So, many of them hurt my skin, which is sensitive and I will get a rash. &#x3D;(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well this product is great because it comes with the moisturizer stick! And it really does work, so yay. It is kind of pricey so it took me a while to commit, but it definitely is worth the price. It does last a while and one package will last about 3 months, which is pretty reasonable if you think about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the other good things is that it doesn&#x27;t feel like it is burning when it is on and it actually does take ALL of the hairs off instead of just some of them. With Nair I had to leave it on for way too long and I would still be stuck with some hairs i had tweeze out anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as it says it is supposed to before it grows back. I also hate that you have to wait until your hair is a certain length before it works effectively, but that is just the nature of these creams and has nothing to do with the brand itself. Olay really does make quality products.</li>
    <li> I was super disappointed in this. I followed the directions exactly, and even did extra time with no luck. It was for medium/coarse hair, and it didn&#x27;t even take the fine stuff off either.  Will not be re buying</li>
    <li> Best i have used thus far with no burning or redness</li>
    <li> Too hard to use and didn&#x27;t work well.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
    <li> Bottom line - doesn&#x27;t work at all for coarse facial hair as product promises.  Didn&#x27;t remove peach fuzz well either.  Disappointing.</li>
    <li> This product is very effective with the fine and medium hair.  However, the coarse hair is not totally removed with this product.</li>
    <li> I go by the motto &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; and figured I would buy a high quality product with a reputable brand.  I didn&#x27;t think twice about shelling out $25 for this item because I just &amp;#34; knew it would work&amp;#34;. Boy was I wrong. This product left me with the full handlebar mustache I started with.  Okay, maybe that is an exaggeration; my hair is not coarse, neither is it fine.  But this product failed to live up to its claims.  It removed NO HAIR.  I followed the directions to a &amp;#34;t&amp;#34;--following directions is how I make a living.  But again, this product is ineffective and I will never purchase it again.  I will be seeking a refund with Oil of Olay tomorrow morning when their call centers open back up.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work for me at all. I have tried leaving it on longer, putting more on, and even not using the balm stuff first, but nothing works. Waste of money for me at least. It didn&#x27;t even remove the thin, fine hair....would not recommend. Very pricey too....</li>
    <li> Love these little wands :)  - easy to use, no mess and long lasting.</li>
    <li> This did not work for me and I was very much disappointed. I followed the directions to a T and nothing happened at all. I don&#x27;t recommend this at all.</li>
    <li> This product does work, but be very careful and read the instructions thoroughly.</li>
    <li> Good, but didn&#x27;t solve my problem.</li>
    <li> have only used it twice, and haven&#x27;t seen hardly any hair removed.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t remove the small coarse embarrassing hair. I had high hopes for this product being Olay. But sadly just another company lying about what their product can do. If it only works on the fluffy facial hair why say different. Wasted my money on yet another lie. Olay, I thought better of you.</li>
    <li> Love the Olay Smooth Finish Facial! Its easy to apply, its not too smelly, its quick and removes most of the hair on the face.</li>
    <li> I am happy to announce that this product works perfectly on upper lip! Much better, and far less painful than waxing!</li>
    <li> I must have much more \\&quot;coarse\\&quot; hair than this product claims it will treat or it is simply not effective, because it didn&#x27;t do much at all for me. I was able to wipe away a few of the finer hairs, but I still had to pluck the dark, coarse hairs, and to me it actually seemed harder to pluck them - not easier like one reviewer stated... It didn&#x27;t leave any redness which was nice, and there was noticeably less odor than products like Nair; for the price and with the previous positive reviews I really expected much more than I got.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased and satisfied with my purchase of the Olay Smooth Finish Hair Removal duo.  This is the first product that has done what it claims to do! Did not irritate my face or leave red, dry spots.</li>
    <li> Make sure you have no type of irritation on your face whatsoever before you use this product. I do not have sensitive skin at all and have had no problems with other facial hair removers. Everything seemed fine after I used it until the next morning I woke up and looked in the mirror. I had 2 burn marks on my face. I would not leave the house for 2 days because I was so embarassed.</li>
    <li> Does a great job &amp; I have no skin reaction to it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome no burn on the face at all. Just don&#x27;t get too much of the protective stuff on or you won&#x27;t get good removal.</li>
    <li> The best hair remover ever!!</li>
    <li> This is by far the worst hair removal product I ever bought. It did not remove the hair. What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Use along with another product.</li>
    <li> very good but if your skin is sentitive be careful.</li>
    <li> love it,  the same effect as ones  bought in pharmacies but they are much lesser cost at Amazon. will order again</li>
    <li> Works great but make sure you use the moisture barrier stick before applying remover.</li>
    <li> I was intrigued by this product and spent the $20 . Unfortunately, this product did not work. I kept trying but to know avail. There are other less expensive products on the market which are more effective.</li>
    <li> This product is OK.  It DOES remove the hair from my upper lip however, within 7 days its growing back.  It really does remove in the 8 mins and there is literally NO smell which is nice.  Just wish it lasted longer because it isn&#x27;t cheap!</li>
    <li> Since minus stars are not available a 1 star it is. I have admittedly sensitive skin, so I bought the fine hair product and watched the clock carefully and only left it on for 6 minutes. Two days later I woke up with a blistered upper lip. The blistering spread and the inflammation spread to the entire lower half of my face. 17 days after using the product, and a costly prescription, my face is still red and now peeling and so itchy I have a hard time sleeping. So I would say this product is not worth it. I did notify Olay via their website and also via Facebook. The person managing the Facebook website was much more responsive and sent me a refund which the people working the website did not offer to do. hopefully I&#x27;ll only suffer this crazy red face for another week or so. I&#x27;m posting pictures so people know I wasn&#x27;t exaggerating. I have a ton of other Olay products that I really do like, and have always been great on my sensitive skin, so this one was a real disappointment.</li>
    <li> It works better than the other creams I had tried but the instructions are a little scary. It&#x27;s a two-part procedure. You have to make sure you have the protective conditioning cream covering everywhere you want the hair removed because the 2nd step says you can&#x27;t let the hair remover cream touch your actual skin.</li>
    <li> It left a little stub behind and it was a bit irritating to my face. Don&#x27;t think I would buy again,&lt;br /&gt;I need to try it again and see if these happen again.</li>
    <li> I tried it. I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> I love Olay but this hair removal duo didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> So far, I&#x27;ve just used this once, but I can say that it did the job.  So, no doubt I&#x27;ll be ordering it again.  I was worried about it burning my skin, but with the soothing balm, that didn&#x27;t happen, and I have fair and tender skin.  No unpleasant odor either.</li>
    <li> I used this yesterday, followed instructions exactly, today I have stubble hair! I would rather pull out the hairs than spend all of this money for a product that does not work!</li>
    <li> Worked well on hair on upper lip, but did not work as well on chin hair.  Disappointed because that&#x27;s what I really needed it for.</li>
    <li> I need to order more of the product.  It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve tried that actually works on coarse hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel that this works any better than any other 7 .00 cream at the drugstore-I still had to use the tweezers after and I left it on for 11 minutes. I gave it 1 star because u had to pick a star and also bc it did not irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> I have dark, coarse hair on my chin and neck area, which is extremely embarrassing. Plucking no longer works because it causes too much pain, so I was hoping this might be effective. Paid $25, followed the directions exactly, and not a single hair was removed. Unfortunately, I do have irritation/burning left behind but thankfully no redness. Also not amused with Olay&#x27;s Satisfaction Guaranteed policy as they take 4-6 weeks to send you A PRE-PAID CARD. Wanna bet it&#x27;s only good for Olay or P&amp;G products? Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Horrible! Does not work!!! Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> product works just like any other 5 dollar product. hair comes back right away in a week im full of upper lip hair again. wouldnt reccomend</li>
    <li> The olay cream is a bit dissappointing. It only removes a portion of what your trying to get rid of. I bought the medium to coarse followed direction and it still doesnt get rid of the thicker hairs. Plus you have to use it again in a few days to make sure you got everything. It also irritates the skin for a few hours. Olay could do better, its too expensive, too little, and ineffective.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well. Hair seems to come back rather quickly though (in two to three days).</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all for me.</li>
    <li> This did not remove ANY of my hair. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a good product that works well and does not have a strong odor.  You can find it in stores, but Amazon Prime just makes it so easy and fast so I choose to shop there.</li>
    <li> I applied as directed and left it on for the 8 minutes. As I rinsed it off I could feel that it had irritated my skin. After I examined the area it didn&#x27;t remove any hair, but I do have a bad red blotchy rash on the area. So Definitely a waste of money for me. Plus now my skin feel like I have a chemical burn. Save your money.</li>
    <li> I love Olay moisterizers.  I had no doubt this product would be everything it said it would.  And I was at the end of my rope.  When facial hairs started to show up in my late 20&#x27;s--not knowing any better--I cut it off with scissors!  After a few times of this, of course, it came in thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I thought my problems were solved with depillatories.  After about a year or so, all it did was burn; not remove.  I went back to cutting until those hairs became so coarse, I couldn&#x27;t reach them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I started plucking.  That was a solution for a very long time until the hairs became miniscule and very painful to pluck.  I went back to dipilatories.  Soon, the burning started with the dipilatories not working at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate so much this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised at the negative reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure my first result was 100% effective, because you have to follow the direction of how to apply the pre-treatment.</li>
    <li> This stuff actually worked!! It was easy to use and got rid of the hairs where I applied it. I just wish it was not so expensive.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for me.  I have very stubborn coarse hair on my upper lip.  I leave it on for 10 minutes - I believe it says 8 minutes max.  So I don&#x27;t recommend doing that.  If you do - its at your own risk.  But it gets 98% of the hair.  I pluck the rest, usually only a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish that it came with more in the box, and it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove the coarse hair at all!</li>
    <li> Great price on this product.  I love it.  It effectively removes my coarse lip and chin hair. It does not aggravate my sensitive skin at all.</li>
    <li> THIS DID NOT WORK AT ALL  IT HAD A TERRIBLE STRONG ODOR I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED..</li>
    <li> Title says it all.  The cr&amp;egrave;me removed the top of some hairs but stubble remains; they&#x27;ll grow back even faster than shaven hair does. Most hairs were unaffected.  And, despite using the safety cr&amp;egrave;me as directed, the treated skin area is angry, slightly pink, and itchy. I&#x27;m sure this works for many people, but if you&#x27;re trying to get rid of the coarse white chin hair that comes with age,  this doesn&#x27;t even touch it.</li>
    <li> This product has worked great on my sensitive skin, I would totally recommend this product. it hasn&#x27;t caused any irritation or bumps like the sally hansen facial hair removal cream.</li>
    <li> This product worked very well for me. I followed the directions, and my upper lip and the few very annoying chin hairs (which I cannot see to pluck with twisers), all came out! My skin is very smooth and not irritated.&lt;br /&gt;I am sold, and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Wont work on my stubby white facial beard.  Great for the knuckles..</li>
    <li> I got this in the fine hair and after a few uses it didn&#x27;t get the job done. I&#x27;ve used this one once and it did remove all the hair. I&#x27;ll get back to you after I use it again, fingers crossed.&lt;br /&gt;OK it worked well the first two times but this last time not so much. I guess you just get immune to these products. One thing that does help is I use a washcloth and kind of scrub my lip after I remove the product. It&#x27;s not perfect but it helps.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good,I like this.</li>
    <li> i use the medium to coarse and its perfect. I leave on for about ten minutes then wipe off with a wet cotton pad. make sure and apply the balm a little way further than you want to apply the cream to avoid burning your skin. four stars because I have to use it pretty often as the hair grows back pretty quickly. also, it is a bit pricey given the size of the tube.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on the &amp;#34;coarse&amp;#34; hair, but does take the finer stuff off; this was disappointing because I had hoped for more based on the title.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells awful, of course, just like every other depilatory.</li>
    <li> I was so expecting to be frustrated with this like all the other facial depilatory creams I&#x27;ve used but this stuff WORKS! Hallelujah! I&#x27;ve tried Sally Hanson and others which just left me with a stinging face and distinctly not hairless skin. I would always need to leave the stuff on for twice as long as directed to get even a decent result. But with this stick/cream combo my very very sensitive skin was not irritated at all and the hair was gone in exactly 8-10 minutes as the directions claim! It&#x27;s surely on the expensive side, but I am so happy to have found something that actually works.</li>
    <li> Thank you olay! You have given me my confidence back. Y&#x27;all know exactly what you&#x27;re doing this product does exactly what it claims. I have corse hair on my upper lip and a few stray corse hairs on my chin with fine hair on my chin and jaw. Truly no burn, no bad smell &amp; amazing results I will be using this for years to come and the price is amazing as well.</li>
    <li> I received this item right away which was wonderful! In addition, I was really pleased to see that this item was sent from a private business trying to make a few bucks in this poor economy. But, I received the products USED!! This was not in the description and I was so disgusted! I would never use a face product from anybody I know, nor would I use a product from someone I didn&#x27;t know! I would not recommend buying from this seller if they cannot be truthful. This is a manipulative seller.</li>
    <li> This product is only okay -- despite the protective balm, I have experienced some irritation/burn on my face after using it. Oddly, it was in an area adjacent to the application of the hair removing product where the cream wasn&#x27;t directly applied. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell at all and removes hair as effectively as other facial hair removal products (that is, sufficiently but not perfectly). If it was competitively priced to other products, I would purchase it again just to avoid the nasty smell of other products. However, I don&#x27;t think the extra expense is justified.</li>
    <li> GENTLE  ON THE SKIN. LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff.  Happy wife &#x3D; happy life, therefore I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Product is overly priced and doesn&#x27;t work at all as stated. I have given it 3 tries, all it did was leave my face smelling disgusting, made my skin burn and made my skin break out. Might have been able to overlook those things if the product had actually removed the hair. It didn&#x27;t and I had even purchased the stronger kit for medium to coarse hair. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY, BUY NAIR OR VEET FOR BETTER RESULTS AND WAY LESS MONEY!!!!</li>
    <li> My problem area is my upper lip with a few coarse on either side. End result: smooth skin with the coarse hair being shorter.&lt;br /&gt;So I tried again. Same thing. I even called the company. Their first question was if I was African American? I said \\&quot;no\\&quot; and their response was \\&quot;well then the product should have worked, maybe there was user error.\\&quot; I said I paid 20 dollars for it so I used it till it was gone. But still not what the box says it will deliver. The company was \\&quot;sorry to hear that\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Not buying it again!&lt;br /&gt;Ever!</li>
    <li> This works great.  No nasty smell, no harsh chemicals.  YOur face is not left with any redness when you are done.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Very gentile removes hair as advertised</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the hair removal product. I have very sensitive skin and the product removed all hair without irritation. The treated area was smooth and soft. I reapply the treatment once a week and continue to be pleased with the results. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I think the concept is great, I like the packaging, much more convenient than other hair removers.  But it just doesn&#x27;t work well enough.  I&#x27;ve tried it three times now, each time being very careful to follow instruction to a t.  I realized after the first time I have to go 10 minutes, but in fear of doing harm never go over 11.  I have thick Irish hair, but never thought it was the most difficult to remove.  But I have never had even majority success in the hair removal.  And what kind of frustrated me is it leaves the bottom part of the hair and yet when that grows, if I try to tweeze, the hair breaks from being weakened by the cream from the previous attempt.  I would have liked t mark as 2 1/2 stars.</li>
    <li> I love this product b/c I can do it in the privacy of my home and it doesn&#x27;t hurt. I would recommend this product tomy friends</li>
    <li> Returned because product arrived in a non sealed box (tape was visibly removed).</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have sensitive skin and cannot wax.  THis product does not irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It&#x27;s effective and really easy to use.  I originally tried this on a whim because CostCo had a sale on it.  CostCo no longer stocks it but I am hooked and always have two on hand (1 I am using and 1 for when the first one runs out.)</li>
    <li> Milder than most hair removal products. Does not burn.</li>
    <li> It does what it is supposed to do!  What else can I say about a hair remover?</li>
    <li> I have tried this several times, with and without the pre-treatment, and it just doesn&#x27;t get everything.  Kind of disappointing.  I found that if I tried to wipe with a cotton ball as directed, very little came off, but if I &#x27;scraped&#x27; with a fingernail, more of the hairs were removed.</li>
    <li> I was using the Sally Hansen version of this and thought that the Olay brand would be better. Not the case at all. It really hardly worked, and I went back to the Sally Hansen brand.</li>
    <li> I have PCOS so I have coarse facial hair on mr chin and lip. I can pretty much grow a goatee if I don&#x27;t shave for several days. Anyway, this product did not work for me. It removed maybe one tenth of the hair I had on my chin. I even left the cream on for 20 minutes. I had high hopes for this hair remover but it just did not work for me. I am giving it 2 stars because it did remove some hair, the smell was not bad and it did not leave me rashy.</li>
    <li> This product did not work period.  It did not remove any hair at all as it claims it will do.  I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Where has this product been all of my life? It works the first time, not like other products that may take two or three applications to remove all hair. Fantastic.</li>
    <li> Leaves no redness, no allergic reactions, and seems to decease hair growth over the months  have only used it on the face and and am very happy with the product</li>
    <li> If you have that much facial hair, try electrology. It&#x27;s more expensive but it&#x27;s permanent.</li>
    <li> I have hirsutism and grow coarse, dark hairs on my chin and neck. It&#x27;s almost as thick as the hair on my head. I was relieved when they came out with a coarse hair option because I thought I would finally get some worthwhile results. Like many others, i followed the directions as printed, but the time limit proved to be insufficient enough for adequate hair removal. It works better when I leave it on there past 10 minutes. Not to mention, they don&#x27;t give you a lot, and for the type of hair I have, I need to use a LOT in order to get it off to my satisfaction. It seems like the stuff only lasts me 3-5 uses. My hair grows too fast for that, and I&#x27;m a starving college student on minimum wage for less than 20 hours a week. I need things to stretch a long way for a low price. I won&#x27;t be buying this anymore.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work. I applied. I waited. I wiped. The hair remained. I got a hairy chin so I gave this product one star.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and most other attempts at removing facial hair with a cream have left me with a red beard. Not cool. Doesn&#x27;t happen with this though! Even gets my darker, coarser hairs.</li>
    <li> I have tried many facial creams and this is the best one yet. I have found none are perfect, but this one is the best. I tried the one for fine hair first but it didn&#x27;t work too well. Even though I wouldn&#x27;t consider my hair to be &amp;#34;medium to coarse,&amp;#34; it does the job. I also like that the scent is very mild and I doesn&#x27;t sting or burn. After I put it on, I usually set my timer on my phone for 8-9 minutes. Then I wipe it off with a tissue and rinse my skin with warm water.</li>
    <li> I will preface my review by saying I have very fair skin, dark blonde hair and limited/softer hair on my face (not super dark but still noticeable, at least to me). That said, I really do like this product. I have had great luck getting rid of unwanted hair above my lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does not have an overwhelming smell &amp; it does not sting like other cream-based products I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used this to get rid of those pesky middle brows. This can be tricky but the cream&#x27;s angled tube it pretty good at helping spread the product to only where it is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$20 may seem steep but should last you at least a few months, depending on how often you use it. I purchased this in July 2014 &amp; I still have plenty of product left.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I tried this twice and not a single hair came off. I didn&#x27;t overdo it with the skin protecting balm you put on first either - just one swipe and I massaged it in. I suppose everyone is different. $24 is not a huge deal I guess but it was totally useless for me.</li>
    <li> I have fine hairs and some stubborn, coarser hairs on my upper lip &amp; sometimes on my chin.  This actually took care of all of them.  About 8-10 days later, I have some regrowth, but my hair and nails all grow really fast.  I was surprised because products I have used in the past have burned my skin, smelled horrific, and still left the hairs.  This one actually did as claimed, no burn, no bad smell, no hairs left behind.  Very nice, Olay.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t help at all</li>
    <li> I bought this product at Walmart, but Figured I would post a review here. I used this product yesterday. I applied the balm and then the hair removal cream as suggested. I left it on for 10 minutes which is the longest recommended to leave it on. I used a napkin to wipe it off and all the hair was gone. My skin was really smooth. The product didn&#x27;t burn at all while it was on there and there was no pain at all. After wiping it off, I washed the area with lukewarm water as suggested and my skin looked normal. No redness or rash. I did not have any issues the next day either with skin rash or burn. My skin looks normal now. I will definitely buy this product from now on.</li>
    <li> Like this product. Hair grows back faster than showing unfortunately</li>
    <li> Good product. Did not dry out my skin like others. However, did not remove all hair targeted in the allotted time. Overall  a decent product though.</li>
    <li> I used this for some annoying hairs that develop near my chin and jawline. This was a great alternative to plucking. My hair grows incredibly quickly, so after plucking I usually don&#x27;t go more than two to three days before I can feel the hairs coming back. It&#x27;s now day 4 and there is no sign of regrowth in sight. I neglected to do the 48-hour test (to make sure you don&#x27;t have an adverse reaction to the cream first before putting it on your face) but luckily I didn&#x27;t have any adverse reaction to the cream. Will purchase again</li>
    <li> Hair removers always burn my face so I was very excited to read about this hair remover on one of my favorite blogs. The balm you rub in before you apply the hair remover really works! I didn&#x27;t even have any redness after I used it, and that NEVER happens. Usually, the whole area I treat is red and certain areas will have chemical burns for a couple of days, but NOT with this. I took a real chance and used it right before we went out somewhere, and you would have never known I just used it, even without makeup. Another nice benefit is that my skin didn&#x27;t have the weird very smooth feeling that it usually has after using other removers. The feeling is almost like a layer or two of your skin has been removed (because it probably has!) exposing the very new skin underneath. It&#x27;s a weird feeling that I never liked, like your skin was too smooth. I did not get that feeling at all with the Olay remover. My skin just felt normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried that the product might not remove hair as far below the skin as other removers because of the balm being applied first, but it really did. The hair has been gone as long as when I used other removers in the past. I am so happy I found this product!</li>
    <li> Works great!  I have those pesky pop-up coarse hairs on my chin and a few  on my upper lip.  Most hair removal creams for the face leave me plucking quite a bit.  After using this product I had 2 hairs I needed to pluck and they slid right out without resistance which I am attributing to the cream softening the hair. In my experience most hair removal creams have a gross chemical smell and are sometimes scented to try and cover it up which leads to a rotten perfume smell.  This product has no obnoxious smell.  It is really thick and doesn&#x27;t drip which I like.  I would give it 5 stars but the price is a little steep.  The verdict is still out on how long the result lasts but overall I am pleased with the product!</li>
    <li> I ran to get this when I read in the latest \\&quot;Allure\\&quot; magazine, it had made the list for one of their &#x27;picks&#x27; for best products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have some really coarse hairs on the chin that are too light for laser and I was really hoping this product would do what it said it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it first following directions to the \\&quot;T\\&quot;, leaving it on for 10 minutes (the max per instructions), I applied thickly, and you are supposed to rub the balm in for 20 seconds first before applying the remover cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took off ONLY my fine hairs with that time and process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day I re applied more thickly and left it on for 20 minutes (even though recommendations is 10 minutes max). Finally it DID take off most of the coarse hairs, but again, a few were left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good side is it was not as irritating as the other cream hair removal products (which are way to harsh for my sensitive skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No miracle product and absolutely didn&#x27;t live up to the hype in \\&quot;Allure\\&quot; magazine. And very overpriced for the smallish quantity they give you.</li>
    <li> Did not work at all. Used the coarse hair item and nothing happened. Amazon will not take this as a return. I contacted Oil of Olay through there website and explained it did not work. They returned my money on a pre-paid visa card. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical at first to purchase this product as years ago I purchased a similar facial hair removal cream and it burned my skin so bad I had to wear bandages on my face for 2 weeks. So knowing Oil of Olay has a money back guarantee and I have used their products in the past, I dove in feet first. I have issues with hair growth on my chin and neck. This happened after the birth of my first daughter. Over the years it has gotten a bit worse. I went to an electrolysis and that made it worse. Plus it was painful. So I followed the directions, making sure to get enough of the protecting balm on the area and the surrounding areas, then covered the areas to treat with enough of the depilatory cream, so as no skin to show through, set the timer for 10 minutes and waited. When the timer went off, I removed the area above my lip first. I dont have an issue there but have fine blonde hairs there and maybe 1 or 2 darker hairs at the corner. And it worked ! No hair. gone, zilch, all of the upper lip hair is gone, smooth, no redness or irritation. So next , the truth will be told as i start to remove the areas on my chin and neck. I am seeing hairs on the tissue paper. I wipe it all clean, rinse with lukewarm water and rush back to the mirror. 94% clear ! No hair,. I had to pluck a few. maybe 5-10. but those were really short hairs, too close to the skin to probably remove with the cream I am guessing. but There are no hairs, no irritation, no redness, no blisters. The cream never burned or tingled or irritated my skin and I have very sensitive skin. And the hairs I removed that I had major concern about, were medium to thick/course hairs. So I am sold on this product. The only irritation I feel now are from me pinching my chin 2-4 times with the tweezers as I attempted to grab those pesky small hairs that were too short to remove with the cream/treatment. So I am sold !! I can now go out and not fear that someone will see stubble, unshaved hairs, or even razor rash/burn. And I sweat a lot as it is and being hot and humid here, i immediately get razor burn/irritation from sweating or the heat out doors. I feel confident. I feel like a woman again. And I definitely recommend this product. Oh, I went with the medium/course hairs as I read reviews and although I could consider half of the hairs to treat light to medium, i went with the medium/course to make sure that it worked . and It did. So try it out. You won&#x27;t be sorry you did.rn. And I sweat a lot as it is and being hot and humid here, i immediately get razor burn/irritation from sweating or the heat out doors.

    <li> This Olay Facial Hair Removal kit did not really work for me. I left it on for 10 minutes as instructed, but when I wiped it off, very little hair came off. It also left a burning sensation on my upper lips after I used it.</li>
    <li> even leaving this on for the required 10 minutes, which is the longest recommended time, it still did not completely remove all of the hairs I had covered with the product. If you have fine or sparse hair to get rid of, then this should wiork great, but if using on something more extreme, you might want to consider something else.</li>
    <li> This works pretty well, but it&#x27;s still quicker and more convenient to go to a nail place for a lip wax. This stuff wasn&#x27;t  bad, but there are too many steps to make it convenient, and it doesn&#x27;t get all the hair.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these  (because I could not find product locally) and intended to be able to use it on my 86 year old mother as well.  After using it on myself, however, I found that I believe it would be too strong for her delicate skin.  While it did a great job for me, and did not give me a rash, I felt a bit of a tingling sensation for a few days on my upper lip, making me believe I should not try it on her.  I am very pleased with using the product for myself - because I have tough skin, but would not recommend it for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I got this for my girlfriend and this is what she had to say. \\&quot;Seeing the videos on you tube and reading reviews online I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would be the right product for me. I have pretty sensitive skin and was really hoping the chemicals wouldn&#x27;t irritate it, because the last thing I wanted was chemical burns on my face! So a few nervous days went by waiting for the package wondering, did I just waist $20? Will it work as is says it will? When I opened the package it was in a box just like you would have bought it off the shelf somewhere. The instructions want you to put a small dab on you forearm first to make sure that you don&#x27;t have a reaction. So I did that waited a long time, although not as long as they want you to wait (48 hours) usually if I brake out from something it happens almost instantly. Nothing happened so I continued on with my treatment. Upon completing my treatment I can say this stuff is AWESOME! It took the facial hair completely off the areas applied, GONE! One thing though if you&#x27;ve ever used Nair...The smell is exactly the same, if you haven&#x27;t, it smells like burning hair and grandmas deviled eggs... doesn&#x27;t stink up the house or anything, but you can smell it that&#x27;s for sure. In conclusion, this product rocks and I would recommend it to anyone with even the slightest bit of unwanted facial hair.\\&quot; SO they&#x27;re you have it! Girlfriend happy &#x3D; Me happy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;A VERY Satisfied Customer</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin, but it also didn&#x27;t remove all my hair. I only used a bit of the balm and I fully coated my upper lip with the hair remover and left it on for 10 minutes (the maximum). I have fairly coarse hair and even though I purchased the coarse hair kit, there were still some hairs left. I have yet to find a hair remover that works on my hair.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a better product that would totally remove the unwanted hairs from the chin area, however this product only gets most of it not all. No burning or skin irratation though, which is a plus.</li>
    <li> I am a licensed cosmetologist and have done professional hair removal. I have never smelled a cream hair remover that smelled this great. I am sad to report I did not get good results. The hairs did not budge. Back to the tweezers.</li>
    <li> It works, not perfectly but I think the medium to coarse is in fact different that the one for fine hair.  It may be a problem with sensitive skin, and the instructions as per time to leave it on and frequency of use should be followed.</li>
    <li> This product was OK. It didn&#x27;t totally remove hair.  Even after I left it on beyond the recommended time.</li>
    <li> It worked but it worked a lot better on my arm where i tested then it did on my face the hair was back in a couple of days it stays away longer when i tweez</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the results I have achieved with Olay Facial Hair Removal. It works well on the coarser hair as well as on the fine fuzzy hairs. It&#x27;s especially nice to be able to use it in the privacy of you own home.</li>
    <li> I am a brunette and do not like the hair around my lips, which, while fine and blondish, is noticeable to me.  When I saw this, I was excited to try.  I don&#x27;t mind waxing my brows, but just didn&#x27;t want to wax my lips.  This is a two process kit - start off by applying the balm to the area you want to depilate.  Then apply the cream, wait the required time, then remove with a soft cloth or paper towel.  Works perfectly.  If you are familiar with Nair or Neet, this doesn&#x27;t have the obnoxious scent.  Very happy with this!  This is for facial hair BELOW the eyebrows.  If you want a great brow wax kit for at-home waxing, Sally Hansen has kits that work great for brows.</li>
    <li> I Left on the time span that was required and product did not work. No rating, 1 would do it justice, but it would not take my review without rating. So I have to rate 1</li>
    <li> i like this been using this about a year after seeing a review on youtube..works fine does not burn my face i just apply it wait about ;8 ;mins then take off with tissue or cotton balls then wash my face with cool water. i usually do once a month....the hair does not grow back fast, but every one is different for me i love it.</li>
    <li> was hesitant to purchase this.  The second time I used it, it worked great.  First time, I didnt apply enough of the cream.  It doesnt remove it all or completely but it does what it says. No burning. No red marks. No blotches.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a while now.  It works wonders.  My skin is very sensitive and I never have a problem using this!</li>
    <li> its&#x27;s pricey - could be a better value for the cost - 2 small tubes and unnecessarily deceptively large packaging.</li>
    <li> First time I&#x27;ve ever used a hair removal cream, and this one worked just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are super easy, put protector balm on skin, massage it in, then apply a thick layer of the cream. Leave for 8 minutes, and take it off with a tissue, and rinse/wash skin. Easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream has a fresh smell and doesn&#x27;t sting or burn. My skin felt a little hot/irritated afterwards, but a few coats of moisturizer and this went away within 10 mins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish I&#x27;d found this product earlier.</li>
    <li> It worked really well to remove the hair on my upper lip, which stayed gone for a week and a half! But it irritated my chin (I have sensitive skin) and the hair on my chin grew back in a few days.</li>
    <li> So, I was super stoked to get this. I have blondish hairs on my upper lip with a few dark coarse hairs thrown in for good measure. It&#x27;s not a \\&quot;mustache\\&quot; but it&#x27;s noticeable to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions exactly. Two different times. Mostly, it just melted the hair but it was still attached to my face. The coarser hairs were still there in their entirety. I noticed when I wiped it off at ten minutes that there were some of the finer hairs removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, it just made my upper lip hair feel weird and stiff. For the money I spent, I expected a friggin&#x27; miracle. But it didn&#x27;t break me out, cause a cold sore or make me red and itchy. It also didn&#x27;t really remove the hair as promised.</li>
    <li> Works better than any other product of this type that I have tried. No redness and skin remains smooth as promised. &#x27;Will definitely use this again!</li>
    <li> works well, not quite as advertised, but glad i bought it</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom and I she loved it.. She said that it is a great product that took away her unwanted hair easily and left her skin smooth.. Recommended..</li>
    <li> Save your money if you have coarse hair--this product didn&#x27;t make a dent.  It does dissolve the fine hair, but I bought it for the coarse ones.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m blonde and fair-skinned. I get a lot of light colored but coarse hair on my chin. I&#x27;ve gotten tired of plucking since I have to do it almost every day to keep up and in-home waxing products irritated my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, I&#x27;m very pleased with how this product removed hair. I used it as directed and left it on for the maximum 10 minutes. My hair wiped away like a dream, leaving only 4 or 5 left over to pluck (way better than my whole chins worth!). I had absolutely no redness or irritation. Could have walked out of my house the minute after I removed the product and been just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I used the product on Thursday night before bed and it&#x27;s now Saturday morning and I have visible stubble. I was really hoping for a product that would leave me smooth for a little longer than that, especially for what I paid for it. I will keep using it at least until it&#x27;s gone, and maybe it will help reduce some of the hair growth. Not sure if I&#x27;ll repurchase or not.</li>
    <li> I used this heavily and still did not get all the hair off. I do have thick hair and even left it on longer. Got most off but spotty.</li>
    <li> This product is great if you want to remove that baby-fine down that only you can see.  If you have serious problems, save your money for electrolysis.  I left it on until it ate the skin, but not the hair.</li>
    <li> After hormonal changes, I needed to remove some facial hair and this worked great. Easy to use too.</li>
    <li> I am a very fair skinned, dark haired brunette, as you may imagine this causes a bit of a problem when hair grows in unwanted places. It shows even if it&#x27;s very fine. Hair on my upper lip has always been a bit embarrassing. I have tried soooo many products and methods in removing hair and I have to say this product is the most pleasant and successful I have tried thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell awful (I wouldn&#x27;t want to wear it as perfume but it doesn&#x27;t smell like a lot of depilatory creams tend to, if you haven&#x27;t experienced other creams they tend to smell to me like rotten eggs, this smells more like a lotion.) The balm they give you, if you follow the instructions actually works to prevent your skin from burning. I have tried other products without that balm and my sensitive skin reacted very badly to the chemicals in the cream, with this there is no chemical burn or unpleasantness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow the instructions and don&#x27;t leave the cream on for more than the time suggested. I am very pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> Not a good buy; it removed the hair but it grew right back and it did state it supposed to be smooth for a while without reapplying.</li>
    <li> Ok so I&#x27;ve had chin hair issues for awhile. SO EMBARRASSING!! Even with my husband I felt uncomfortable. So I started trying different things, even got NoNo (which was a total waste of money!) Anyway I saw this and wanted to give it a try. The first time I used it I saw a little change but still had to pluck lots of hairs. Ugh! Was disappointed but gave it another shot. Tonite was the 4th time using it and it got ALL the hair YAY!!!! Although, I use just a little of the balm stick, probably less than I should but the hair is gone so it works still! Thanks Olay!!</li>
    <li> does not work. Just a waste of money like all the other products out there. Stick to wax :) or a razor o.O</li>
    <li> Really a good product.  Does a great job and doesn&#x27;t damage my skin, but those with sensitive skin may still need to be careful.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and it worked fine on the upper lip didn&#x27;t bother me at all and no redness.  When I did use it on my chin it was fine until I wiped it off and it started to sting and slightly red. But after a few seconds the redness went away, but the stinging continued. I just can&#x27;t use it on my chin. So before using it, test it if you have sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Removes fine &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; hairs like a boss! Doesn&#x27;t remove the dark, coarse ones that are really the problem! I followed the instructions EXACTLY and even read user reviews before trying it out but I have not managed to get around this problem.</li>
    <li> This product does not work...I was so excited to finally be happy to use a product instead of going through&lt;br /&gt;waxing....Very disappointed that I wasted $20.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes since this was an Olay product. I&#x27;ve used many things &amp; have always had issues removing the hair in my upper lip. I&#x27;ve tried at home waxing kits &amp; removal creams. I used this for the recommended time, 10 minutes. I took it off with a tissue, &amp; nothing. Not one hair was removed! This product is total crap. What a waste of money!</li>
    <li> Product did absolutely NOTHING!!!!  I would have rated this product 0 stars, but that was not an option......  I expected a better product from Olay~~VERY disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> Works great, just wish you got more for your money.&lt;br /&gt;other than that i would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> Burned my skin! Returned it!</li>
    <li> Best facial hair removal cream!  It really works.</li>
    <li> Recently I&#x27;ve notice more and more hair on my face. I&#x27;ve tried many different ways of battling it, but this product has by far been the best way I&#x27;ve found. It&#x27;s quick, easy and pain free. The results last for several weeks. Over all, I&#x27;m a believer and will be sure to keep this in my home.</li>
    <li> Works pretty good.  It doesn&#x27;t remove all the hair.  I&#x27;ve never had any pain when using it.</li>
    <li> This product is good but if your hair is thick then it could take more cream or you might have to let the cream sit longer, which is a little frustrating.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Have on repeat auto ship &amp; use every month.  I have red, blond fine hair and both fine &amp; medium products remove all unwanted facial hair</li>
    <li> It took out three hairs and burned. Unfortunately, it was a waste of money. I have to go back to the salon for waxing/</li>
    <li> I wanted a painless alternative to waxing, and think is alright for that.  I don&#x27;t hate it and I do use it, but it only gets maybe half the hair even leaving it on for 10 minutes, and I have to go back with tweezers, which makes me think I should just go back to waxing.</li>
    <li> used this 4 time and NOTHING it did NOT work. what a waste of money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay product. Works okay for coarse upper lip hair, just have to leave it on longer. And, the hair seems to grow back too quickly. However, I keep using it since it doesn&#x27;t burn like other depilatory creams do.</li>
    <li> Too pricey. But works.</li>
    <li> My worst area is chin hair and it comes in in spots with black hairs, very ugly. Normally i use nair or veet or pluck but was trying to find something more gentle.&lt;br /&gt;Ive tried it twice and i get just a few hairs to remove! Such a disapointment.&lt;br /&gt;I have it now, ive sent the money which is another flaw. $20-$25 is A LOT of money for this. Esp when you can get nair or veet for half that and you... i get double the usage! Even if i use it besides my chin!&lt;br /&gt;I wouldnt recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I used it as required, put on the smoothing cream then the hair removal cream for 8-10 min on my upper lip. After I wiped it with a tissue, It started burning all day and left some injuries there. The next day I still look horrible. Not going to buy this ever again.&lt;br /&gt;There is much cheaper bleaching products out there and more effective!</li>
    <li> This worked better than the Nair I had been previously using. It took the hair away in 8 minutes and did not leave me with any sort of irritated red skin afterwards, which I would get a bit of with other product. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> This works well for fine hair, like peach fuzz, anything more coarse than that wont budge.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to buy  this product at first cause I was a little skeptical about it, mainly because of the bad reviews. My mom purchased it for me (she hates it when I shave my upper lip) so I decided try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to thank my mom cause I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It removed every single hair I had and it took two weeks for me to see hair growth. Which is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did try it on my chin hair which is very coarse and long (I know, it&#x27;s embarrassing) and it only removed about 70% of it so yeah. I just plucked the rest of them out. When the hair starts to grow back, then I&#x27;ll go back over it with the olay product and it should be able to take everything off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess if it&#x27;s really long and coarse, it won&#x27;t take it off amazingly well but if you use it when  your coarse hair is still growing. It should work well. Hope that made sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do a feel a burning tingle when you put it on. Nothing painful but I was a little worried and  it turned out to be fine but I don&#x27;t know how this will do on really sensitive skin. Just make sure to wash your face afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah, I like it and recommend it. It is on the pricey side but it should last me awhile. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> It does somewhat a ok job but hair grows back super fast, wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. This product broke my chin out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought plenty of hair removal products in my day. Most of them smell awful and burn, and waxing is just painful. But Olay has revolutionized facial hair removal. I use this on my upper lip as well as my eyebrows and it gets the hair off every time without any pulling, burning, or ripping. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, and leaves my skin feeling smooth and moisturized when I wipe it off. My only suggestion is that you should wipe it off with a wet towel, not a dry one.</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait until I&#x27;d used the product multiple times before reviewing, simply because user error is always a possibility the first time you try something new.  That said, I have used the product three times now, and I have to say that I find it a less than effective method for those of us with dark hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using as directed, the product will remove fine hairs.  It will not, however do much for coarse, or thick hair like mine. (I am of Mediterranean descent.)  Used as directed at the low end of the time, I did not experience much discomfort; however, at the upper end of the time limit, I developed blisters which have not yet healed a few days later.  (I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin, so I found this development to be surprising.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The mineral/petroleum jelly stick is a nice idea, and after the removal creme is gone, I imagine it will make a lovely cuticle moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;Removal of fine hair seems effective and as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Product does not seem to work for black hair or coarse hair.&lt;br /&gt;Product caused blistering at the upper range of the published time limit&lt;br /&gt;Product is considerably more expensive than it&#x27;s market peers, but does not seem to offer additional value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a rule, I&#x27;m a big fan of Olay products, and use a considerable number of their line targeted at women of a &amp;#34;certain age&amp;#34;, but I think this product is a miss and I won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Use about once a month!</li>
