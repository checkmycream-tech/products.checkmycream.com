      <li>I love this!</li>
      <li>every 2weeks, it smells great and feels light on my face , I feel awoke and refreshed after the use of this</li>
      <li>Smells nice</li>
      <li>i liked the feeling of it cleaning my face.</li>
      <li>I really love the lemon smell, very refreshing, revitalizing.</li>
      <li>smells great, works pretty well.</li>
      <li>and smell was nice and not too strong.</li>
      <li>most ppl with Celiac&#x27;s do not have a skin reaction...</li>
      <li>and I love the smell.</li>
      <li>Dryness got better as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My face does not shine nor look better after using this product.  </li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>This scrub smells great and works very well.  </li>
      <li>this product smells amazing and leaves my skin hydrated and smooth</li>
      <li>Love that it&#x27;s natural.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better now</li>
      <li>and i love it as a mask rather than a scrub.  </li>
      <li>I love this scrub.</li>
      <li>It kind of makes it glow like when I&#x27;m pregnant.  </li>
      <li>Smells great and leaves the skin feeling soft.</li>
      <li>use this for now until I find a perfect (for my skin) brightening scrub without any harsh chemical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t have a satisfaction of scrub effect of clean feeling after the wash.&lt;br /&gt;(Hard</li>
      <li>Love this brand 100 % pure.</li>
      <li>In fact, I wasn&#x27;t even sure what a product promising \\&quot;skin brightening\\&quot; was supposed to do.  </li>
      <li>and I am just used to something more abrasive that you feel like you are really exfoliating.  </li>
      <li>Love the smell, very citrus and yummy.  </li>
      <li>Here is a great article that breaks it all down...</li>
      <li>But if you like the larger beads and have dry skin, this should work great for you!</li>
      <li>I love using natural products.  </li>
      <li>there are simply not enough beads to be an effective scrub.  </li>
      <li>Gentle beads and a rich emollient texture helps you exfoliate while you hydrate.</li>
      <li>My skin is not only clear, and bright and luminescent, but it is also not in need of moisturizer, or wrinkle or acne cream any longer.</li>
      <li>The scrub is very gentle on my normal/dry skin.</li>
      <li>like to product allot , its just it goes very fast</li>
      <li>I first time I used as scrub(massaging kinda wash),  so oily texture</li>
      <li>This smells divine and leaves my skin feeling so soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>I like this much better than the daily foaming face wash...</li>
      <li>But 100% Pure still uses this ingredient that does exactly what synthetic parabens do.</li>
      <li>Then I was going to use toner (also 100% Pure brightening toner), my skin was peeled off.</li>
      <li>This line is, as it indicates, 100% pure with no chemicals.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;your face looks so healthy nad lively the last couple of days what have you been doing to it\\&quot; ...</li>
      <li>I love most 100% Pure products and this one definitely makes my skin cleaner, softer and a little brighter after using it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s almost too gentle.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m really picky</li>
      <li>Highly recommended for anyone!</li>
      <li>The scrub beads aren&#x27;t very scrubby.</li>
      <li>This scrub works really well</li>
      <li>However, this stuff really makes my face appear awake and refreshed.  </li>
      <li>I received this in a kit that I had purchased and had tried it out not expecting much.  </li>
      <li>Met expectations as a gentle face wash/scrub.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very greasy (as I have oily skin) or that it&#x27;s beads</li>
      <li>I have the 100 Percent Pure foam cleanser in green tea and lemon and love them, however I wasn&#x27;t too keen on this scrub.</li>
      <li>I like scrubs that feel like baking soda or something slightly a bit more abrasive.  </li>
      <li>the reason above 3 stars; some what works, just not enough for the price unless they change to a better formula.</li>
      <li>When you leave it on as a mask it has a light clear consistency and the scrub particles are made from actual sugar.</li>
      <li>This product is last in a line of products I have tried for my gluten free, sensitive (wicked-I burn within seconds, and anything with wheat or paba has me breaking out) acne</li>
      <li>This product contains Japanese Honeysuckle, and many say using Japanese honeysuckle is a way for companies to hide their parabens.</li>
      <li>plus I think it would go on better as a mask if it were a little thicker...</li>
      <li>And FYI, from what I&#x27;ve noticed looking at their ingredients, 100% Pure uses this in MANY (if not most) of their skincare products.</li>
      <li>80-90 degrees (sitting on UPS truck all day) or if that is normal for this product.</li>
      <li>I tend to have normal to oily, acne-prone skin.</li>
      <li>It actually whitened my skin right after use.</li>
      <li>I tried creams, and washes, and masks that cost more than my mortgage payment, trying to get my skin to just look normal (i.e. not bright red, and filled with pustules...)</li>
      <li>I have to buy a new one</li>
      <li>First, the granules are quite large and sparse, the size reminiscent of Neutrogena Deep Cleaning Invigorating Foaming Scrub.</li>
      <li>Pure Brigtening Scrub, and facial mask should not be sold anyone, While washing my face this prouduct took off skin off my nose.</li>
      <li>and when I use a little lotion afterward my skin looks fantastic.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have any allergies but sensitive to some products as not getting any younger plus a little sun damage :)</li>
      <li>and i look so alive</li>
      <li>If the beads were much smaller, gentle massage to spread and massage/scrub</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve basically been using it like a cleanser after st ives apricot scrub and it does leave my face soft and refreshed.</li>
      <li>I started using whole series, so check out my other 100% Pure brightening series review as well.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
      <li>The initial watery consistency is a bit thicker now that I&#x27;ve used more of the tube, not sure if it was watery initially because it was delivered in very high temps</li>
      <li>my worry, no more peeling my skin off after I use as more of a mask (spread all over the face, wait a bit, then massage very short time).</li>
      <li>The main issue is a chemical in Japanese honeysuckle called para-hydroxy benzoic acid that acts just like a paraben.</li>
      <li>I really did not think this product would work very well,i have a few acne scars from before i was pregnant,since i had my baby</li>
      <li>this product is not very brightening, but it is very hydrating</li>
      <li>Thus, I can only use the scrub/mask when my skin is on dry side or my face will be very oily afterwards.</li>
      <li>They feel like little silicone beads and are very diffuse in the emulsion.  </li>

<li> scrubbing may dry up/peel your skin, but mask with a little massage leaves skin feeling of residue/stick unclean</li>

    <li> Met expectations as a gentle face wash/scrub. It actually whitened my skin right after use. I don&#x27;t have any allergies but sensitive to some products as not getting any younger plus a little sun damage :)</li>
    <li> I received this in a kit that I had purchased and had tried it out not expecting much.  In fact, I wasn&#x27;t even sure what a product promising \\&quot;skin brightening\\&quot; was supposed to do.  However, this stuff really makes my face appear awake and refreshed.  I don&#x27;t know how - but it does.  It kind of makes it glow like when I&#x27;m pregnant.  Not only that, I found that it seems to minimize the look of my pores.  It also has a wonderful fresh citrus scent.  The effect doesn&#x27;t last all day, but it does work immediately after I use the product.  I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d buy it again since it is expensive, but it does definitely work.</li>
    <li> this product is not very brightening, but it is very hydrating and i love it as a mask rather than a scrub.  there are simply not enough beads to be an effective scrub.  this product smells amazing and leaves my skin hydrated and smooth and i will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I started using whole series, so check out my other 100% Pure brightening series review as well.&lt;br /&gt;When I first time I used as scrub(massaging kinda wash),  so oily texture so I massaged longer than the usual. Then I was going to use toner (also 100% Pure brightening toner), my skin was peeled off. My skin was a bit dry-ish after the wash as well.&lt;br /&gt;Despite my worry, no more peeling my skin off after I use as more of a mask (spread all over the face, wait a bit, then massage very short time). Dryness got better as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Brightens a bit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-May not for a sensitive skin due to my skin peeling results&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t have a satisfaction of scrub effect of clean feeling after the wash.&lt;br /&gt;(Hard scrubbing may dry up/peel your skin, but mask with a little massage leaves skin feeling of residue/stick unclean effect)&lt;br /&gt;- Agreed with other reviewer&#x27;s comment about the beads, too big for the consistency of scrub to match. If the beads were much smaller, gentle massage to spread and massage/scrub easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this for now until I find a perfect (for my skin) brightening scrub without any harsh chemical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the reason above 3 stars; some what works, just not enough for the price unless they change to a better formula.</li>
    <li> like to product allot , its just it goes very fast I have to buy a new one every 2weeks, it smells great and feels light on my face , I feel awoke and refreshed after the use of this</li>
    <li> I really did not think this product would work very well,i have a few acne scars from before i was pregnant,since i had my baby the acne has not reappeared and i was looking to liven up my very dull skin,with pregnancy induced melasma my face was not looking to good,i use this as a mask every night for five minutes and i have to say i look like am glowing the scars have started to fade and i look so alive,my husband comented the other day as i got in bed \\&quot;your face looks so healthy nad lively the last couple of days what have you been doing to it\\&quot; ...i practically giddy with excitement as i told him wat i have been doing..i will definately continue to buy.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the bomb. Gentle beads and a rich emollient texture helps you exfoliate while you hydrate. This line is, as it indicates, 100% pure with no chemicals. You can feel good about these products.</li>
    <li> i liked the feeling of it cleaning my face. and smell was nice and not too strong.</li>
    <li> Dumb move, but I decided to research the ingredients in this (and 6 other 100% Pure products that I purchased) AFTER purchasing them. What I found was disturbing. This product contains Japanese Honeysuckle, and many say using Japanese honeysuckle is a way for companies to hide their parabens. The main issue is a chemical in Japanese honeysuckle called para-hydroxy benzoic acid that acts just like a paraben. Here is a great article that breaks it all down...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this product gets one star because of the company&#x27;s sketchy marketing when they say \\&quot;paraben free\\&quot;. We avoid parabens because they are considered hormone mimickers, and their suspected link to cancers. But 100% Pure still uses this ingredient that does exactly what synthetic parabens do. Unless you do your research, you don&#x27;t know this, and this is what the company hopes, I&#x27;m sure. I had no idea about any of this until I dug a little deeper. And FYI, from what I&#x27;ve noticed looking at their ingredients, 100% Pure uses this in MANY (if not most) of their skincare products.</li>
    <li> I have used and purchased a few times now. I love this scrub. It smells great and feels great. Love this brand 100 % pure. Great Products!</li>
    <li> Did not notice any thing specail about this product.  My face does not shine nor look better after using this product.  The smell is ok.&lt;br /&gt;Would not recomend to anyone.</li>
    <li> smells great, works pretty well. I wish it were a little thicker coming out of the tube because I end up wasting it plus I think it would go on better as a mask if it were a little thicker...probably the same for \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if they&#x27;d make it thicker, I&#x27;d buy again and recommend to others but as it is, probably not&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update Sept 30, 2013: I&#x27;ve been using this product for several weeks now. The initial watery consistency is a bit thicker now that I&#x27;ve used more of the tube, not sure if it was watery initially because it was delivered in very high temps 80-90 degrees (sitting on UPS truck all day) or if that is normal for this product. It&#x27;s better now but I&#x27;m still mystified by the scrub usage, it&#x27;s not like any facial scrub I&#x27;ve ever used. I really love the lemon smell, very refreshing, revitalizing. I haven&#x27;t tried it again as a mask. I&#x27;ve basically been using it like a cleanser after st ives apricot scrub and it does leave my face soft and refreshed.</li>
    <li> Very gentle on the skin and does great job of cleansing!  Will order again.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, very citrus and yummy.  Love that it&#x27;s natural.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t like that it&#x27;s very greasy (as I have oily skin) or that it&#x27;s beads are a bit larger than I wanted.  I like scrubs that feel like baking soda or something slightly a bit more abrasive.  But if you like the larger beads and have dry skin, this should work great for you!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and I&#x27;m really picky so I&#x27;m hard to please. This smells divine and leaves my skin feeling so soft and smooth. Love it.</li>
    <li> I have the 100 Percent Pure foam cleanser in green tea and lemon and love them, however I wasn&#x27;t too keen on this scrub. First, the granules are quite large and sparse, the size reminiscent of Neutrogena Deep Cleaning Invigorating Foaming Scrub. I didn&#x27;t use it as a mask, so I can&#x27;t comment on how it dries, but as a scrub and cleanser, I didn&#x27;t feel that it cleaned my skin well. Since there were so few granules, I didn&#x27;t feel that it exfoliated my skin at all. I would have to rinse several times to get it off as the cleansing lotion was very thick.</li>
    <li> I love this! I like this much better than the daily foaming face wash... I use it twice a week.</li>
    <li> Pure Brigtening Scrub, and facial mask should not be sold anyone, While washing my face this prouduct took off skin off my nose. And yes, it bleed, My face was red for hours. If you like your face don&#x27;t these items.</li>
    <li> Smells great and leaves the skin feeling soft. When you leave it on as a mask it has a light clear consistency and the scrub particles are made from actual sugar. Leaves the skin feeling refreshed.</li>
    <li> I love using natural products.  This is my 2nd purchase of this product.  My skin feels great.  No residue and non-drying!</li>
    <li> This scrub smells great and works very well.  I had a few acne scars that it really seemed to lighten.</li>
    <li> I tend to have normal to oily, acne-prone skin. Thus, I can only use the scrub/mask when my skin is on dry side or my face will be very oily afterwards. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great find.</li>
    <li> I love most 100% Pure products and this one definitely makes my skin cleaner, softer and a little brighter after using it. The scrub is very gentle on my normal/dry skin. I am quite pleased with my purchase but the best thing is that this product does not have any chemicals or toxic ingredients that are harmful to my skin! Highly recommended for anyone!</li>
    <li> This product is last in a line of products I have tried for my gluten free, sensitive (wicked-I burn within seconds, and anything with wheat or paba has me breaking out) acne prone (cystic) skin. I have tried EVERYTHING on the market. Even before I knew I had a gluten sensitivity (skin wise...most ppl with Celiac&#x27;s do not have a skin reaction...I have a wheat allergy as well.) I tried creams, and washes, and masks that cost more than my mortgage payment, trying to get my skin to just look normal (i.e. not bright red, and filled with pustules...) My skin is not only clear, and bright and luminescent, but it is also not in need of moisturizer, or wrinkle or acne cream any longer. My skin is soooo healthy, and it is beautiful! (If I do say so myself...and strangers on the street.) Try it! I have tried the face wash from this same brand and the same &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; and it made me break out, so I use this, and only this...I also DO NOT use it as a mask...so I cannot attest to that. Hope it brings you the joy it has brought me...Good luck!</li>
    <li> This scrub works really well and I love the smell. I use it every time I shower and when I use a little lotion afterward my skin looks fantastic. Plus it&#x27;s healthy for the skin!</li>
    <li> The scrub beads aren&#x27;t very scrubby. They feel like little silicone beads and are very diffuse in the emulsion.  i have used salt scrubs and that st Ives stuff...and I am just used to something more abrasive that you feel like you are really exfoliating.  It&#x27;s almost too gentle.  You could use it daily and hopefully the effect is cumulative. I&#x27;m just used to exfoliating perhaps once or twice a week and expect to feel scrubbing! Smells nice...has a nice cream to it which isn&#x27;t surprising since 100% pure body creams are awesome.</li>
