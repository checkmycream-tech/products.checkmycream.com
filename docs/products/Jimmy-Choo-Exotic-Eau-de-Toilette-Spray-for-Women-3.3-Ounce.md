      <li>good price here compared to macy&#x27;s or dillards</li>
      <li>Loved it and let daughter talk me out of it.</li>
      <li>I love all Jimmy Choo perfumes - another great purchase .</li>
      <li>Plan to buy more if they have it!</li>
      <li>Very happy it was the real thing.</li>
      <li>individuals come to their own conclusions.  </li>
      <li>This is just a great girly scent that is perfect year round, day or night.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of the original Jimmy Choo fragrance, but the Exotic is absolutely amazing!</li>
      <li>however I received the orange exotic.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>I love, love, love, this perfume.  </li>
      <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
      <li>Thanks for great service.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments-</li>
      <li>It is fabulous!  </li>
      <li>I have never had so many comments and compliments on a perfume as with this one.  </li>
      <li>One of my favorite perfumes</li>
      <li>I was under the impression that I was ordering the purple bottle of exotic which I smelled before</li>
      <li>I knew I was going to love this perfume</li>
      <li>I loved it so much that I just ordered 2 from Amazon.  </li>
      <li>This scent is so much better than the normal Jimmy Choo, Love it!</li>
      <li>It is unique, but not overly strong.</li>
      <li>This is a flanker to the original Jimmy Choo.</li>
      <li>This is more on the sweet side than it is floral, which is probably why I like it so much.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, authentic product</li>
      <li>Jimmy Choo is one of my absolute favorites, and the Exotic, well surpasses that.  </li>
      <li>And that&#x27;s probably why I love it so much.</li>
      <li>See excerpt below:  Jimmy Choo will launch a new, limited-edition fragrance for women for summer of 2014 from February 2014 called Exotic.</li>
      <li>Same great smelling perfume in a new box and orange colored bottle.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing, I have Jimmy Choos other perfume (that I LOVE btw), I love this scent for a day fragrance, and Jimmy Choo (light pink box), for night time stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Yummy!!!!</li>
      <li>The latest version in the orange bottle smells more of grapefruit than raspberries, less sweet, more sour.</li>
      <li>The brand already proposed a summery Jimmy Choo Exotic in 2013 and are offering it anew - the very same just - in a burnt orange bottle this time...  </li>
      <li>Lasts MUCH longer than any other spring/summer frag I own.</li>
      <li>but this is the 2014 limited edition of Jimmy Choo Exotic.</li>
      <li>If you find it online, make sure you&#x27;re getting the pink bottle and not the orange one.    </li>
      <li>If you want high quality perfume, buy this one.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve never received a counterfeit product, so I would highly suggest ordering online and saving some cash.</li>
      <li>The orange bottle of exotic doesn&#x27;t last as long as the purple.</li>
      <li>The patchouli and pink grapefruit definitely pop on my skin the most, and it just smells &amp;#34;Exotic&amp;#34; as the name suggests.</li>
      <li>I bought this and many other perfumes via Amazon (Amazon Prime only, no third party vendors)</li>
      <li>As it is limited, I wanted to make certain</li>
      <li>Same as the New Jimmy Choo, now in an orange bottle.</li>
      <li>This is what I expected for a reasonable price compared to department store price.</li>

    <li> I was under the impression that I was ordering the purple bottle of exotic which I smelled before however I received the orange exotic. The orange bottle of exotic doesn&#x27;t last as long as the purple.</li>
    <li> This years fragrance, loved it!! even got some for my daughter.</li>

    <li> Very happy it was the real thing. Plan to buy more if they have it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, I have Jimmy Choos other perfume (that I LOVE btw), I love this scent for a day fragrance, and Jimmy Choo (light pink box), for night time stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Yummy!!!!</li>
    <li> This is what I expected for a reasonable price compared to department store price. Love it!!! I would purchase it again</li>
    <li> saw this at  macy&#x27;s and knew I wanted to get this for my girlfriend.... she loves it... good price here compared to macy&#x27;s or dillards</li>
    <li> I love all Jimmy Choo perfumes - another great purchase .</li>
    <li> Thanks for great service. I love all his scents!!!</li>
    <li> We went to refill my Thierry Mugler perfumes at Macy&#x27;s and were introduced to this limited edition Jimmy Choo.  I have never had so many comments and compliments on a perfume as with this one.  I will not begin to explain the scent...individuals come to their own conclusions.  I loved it so much that I just ordered 2 from Amazon.  It was about the same price as some other retailers, but a lot lower than department stores.  As it is limited, I wanted to make certain I had some bottles to fall back on!</li>
    <li> I knew I was going to love this perfume and I do!  When I opened it and sprayed it - I was in heaven.  Jimmy Choo is one of my absolute favorites, and the Exotic, well surpasses that.  Happy ... VERY happy!  &#x3D; )</li>
    <li> Same as the New Jimmy Choo, now in an orange bottle. Same great smelling perfume in a new box and orange colored bottle. See excerpt below:  Jimmy Choo will launch a new, limited-edition fragrance for women for summer of 2014 from February 2014 called Exotic. This is a flanker to the original Jimmy Choo. The brand already proposed a summery Jimmy Choo Exotic in 2013 and are offering it anew - the very same just - in a burnt orange bottle this time...  UPDATE: SOME CLAIM THERE IS A DIFFERENCE.  Lasts MUCH longer than any other spring/summer frag I own. And that&#x27;s probably why I love it so much. Too bad it&#x27;s not in the stores anymore... If you find it online, make sure you&#x27;re getting the pink bottle and not the orange one.    The latest version in the orange bottle smells more of grapefruit than raspberries, less sweet, more sour.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, authentic product</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t the same smell n the bottle color is different from the one in the actual store like Carson&#x27;s,  Macy&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of the original Jimmy Choo fragrance, but the Exotic is absolutely amazing! The patchouli and pink grapefruit definitely pop on my skin the most, and it just smells &amp;#34;Exotic&amp;#34; as the name suggests. This is more on the sweet side than it is floral, which is probably why I like it so much. This is just a great girly scent that is perfect year round, day or night.  I bought this and many other perfumes via Amazon (Amazon Prime only, no third party vendors) and I&#x27;ve never received a counterfeit product, so I would highly suggest ordering online and saving some cash.</li>
    <li> Not a knockoff fragrance. It smells expensive and a little spicy, but sweet. It is unique, but not overly strong. The bottle is beautiful. I love this fragrance. It lasts all day.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but this is the 2014 limited edition of Jimmy Choo Exotic. Not a favorite one of mines. I was specifically looking for the 2013 version.</li>
    <li> Not what is pictured. The perfume was blue.</li>
    <li> The perfume smells really good.  One of my favorite perfumes</li>
