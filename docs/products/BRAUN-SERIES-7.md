<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had been shaving with Norelco rotary razors for the past 10+ years and always bought the latest \\&quot;top of line\\&quot; model. I had been enticed by the amazing reviews for this Braun for the past 6 months and finally pulled the trigger to order it.    Been using it now for the past 3 weeks and must say I regret waiting so long....even with the steep price tag! Where this razor really shines is the absolute lack of skin irritation. I have sensitive skin and with the Norelco&#x27;s I would only shave mon-fri mornings before work. Never shaved on weekends or touched the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow for fear of redness and pain. However with the Braun I can now shave in morning, night, and weekends without a problem! Like others have said it can also easily handle 4-5 days growth without a problem (and I have think dark hair).    In terms of shaving closeness, the Bruan provides a closer shave on the face without question. On my neck, I would rate it about the same closeness as the Norelco (but no pulling or redness!)  I don&#x27;t find this razor louder then the Norelco models as others have mentioned. It does have to be cleaned more frequently, but this is an acceptable compromise for the results.    If you have sensitive skin, or are up in the air about this product, just buy it! You will not be sorry.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver. My last shaver was a triple-head, that shaved it&#x27;s last shave. I was just looking for the best shaving, most reliable, durable shaver.    This one shaves very close, but still requires multiple passes and more multiple passes to get all the whiskers. The cleaning container is larger than I would have liked: It requires space on a counter near an outlet. At least one of the modes is has a rather loud re-occurring noise in the cleaning process, but it negates the need for manual cleaning. I&#x27;m very happy so far.</li>
    <li> It is an excellent shaver and good value for its price. I was using Panasonic 8047 before this but this a class above. Only problem is its refill cartridge which can&#x27;t be shipped by air being \\&quot;inflammable\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I upgraded from a 9000 series and was blown away by how smooth it feels when shaving. My previous one felt pretty rough. I don&#x27;t notice that it shaves any closer really, but it just feels nicer when I shave and that&#x27;s good enough for me.    My one gripe with it is that the flip out cutter is smaller and not as good as the 9000 series shaver. I use it a lot when I just want to trim my facial hair rather than shave it all off.</li>
    <li> I like the way this razor works on most of my face.  It is also a comfortable shave.  My problem is that I have a very hard time getting all the hairs on my face and especially on my neck.  I actually use the Series 7 first then quickly go over my face and neck one more time with my rotary razor so I can get all the hairs I missed with the Series 7.      The cleaning / charging function of the razor is great.  It is loud but I start the cleaning on my way out the door so it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> Perfect in every way!  I cannot say anything bad about this shaver!  Simply perfect.</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun shavers for the past 10 years, and every time they come up with a new series, I am usually skeptical on how much improvement one would get in shaving performance for shelling out money for a new shaver. This time, however, I was pleasantly surprised. This shaver is definitely a notch above my previous 8995 version. They have re-designed the shaver head, which gives a closer shave, and the battery lasts longer as well. The only downside to Braun shavers is that they sell their proprietary cleaning solution at ridiculous margins(much like how the printer manufacturers sell you their proprietary Ink cartridges).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for nearly 20 years, and this is the best one I&#x27;ve ever purchased. It is very comfortable, both during and after shaving. It shaves quickly and closely without any mess. I like everything about this product so far, and would recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a great electric shaver. It is pricey, but this is an example of getting what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I have the 9595 Pulsonic model for more than a year.  I may have rushed too early to buy it, and the design flaws I see may have been fixed by now...    I have been using Braun shavers for over 30 years, so my experience with this one is terribly disappointing. Here are the design flaws I see:  * The contacts at the back do not make good contact with the charging/cleaning base. When the shaver starts the cleaning cycle, quite often the contacts separate, and both cleaning and charging stop in the middle, leaving the shaver soaked in the cleaning fluid.  * The beard trimmer simply fell off after about 5 months.  * There is a bad contact inside the shaver that randomly stops it in mid shave. This never manifests itself when I take it to the lab (of course...)  I think that the engine is simply too powerful for the rest of the shaver and base.    The shaver shaves well, but is hard to clean without the base, and the base is just plain bad design.  I&#x27;m really at a loss what shaver to get now. Is this model indicative of the quality level of Braun shavers these days?</li>
    <li> I have had the old Braun Flex shaver for years and wanted to update. On a recent trip to Germany, I thought I&#x27;d get one there.  NOT !  The Euro stopped that very quickly. At approx. $1.50 per Euro, and the price there being E 300 (that&#x27;s about $450), I passed on that option immediately.  Bought it on Amazon for $220.    The only thing more satisfying than getting my Braun Pulsonic at half the price....is that it is everthing I expected and more. A smooth, close shave and a cleaning system which leaves me \\&quot;ready to go\\&quot; anytime I need to shave. Execellent.....</li>
    <li> This is without question the best shaver providing the best shave I have experienced.  I had a top of the line Braun shaver for 10 years which just stopped working.  I was somewhat skeptical of the reviews for this shaver but it has performed as the best reviews have suggested.  You won&#x27;t be dissappointed.  Amazon was the best price found for this product...I saved over $50 off compared with our local WalMarts store.</li>
    <li> Been a electric razor user for 12 years.. I typically change shaver once in 4 years. My first one was a braun foil. Liked it. My next one was a Norelco rotary top end model..Liked it and swore would never go to foil again.. But as I was looking at upgrading to norelco aztec, i saw these piled up positive reviews on amazon for this foil razor.. Then I did my research and said i would give it a try.     I must say this pulsonic shaver got converted me to foil once again.. awesome performance.. Far exceeded my expectations..  I thought that auto-cleaning stuff was unnecessary as i was used to tap cleaing. But now i am addicted to it..If i want to nitpick on one, that would be the travel case.. looks cheap. But that is not the important point here. Hey, I wanted a good shaver for the price - Braun delivered it, making my daily shaving chore a pleasure..thanks..</li>
    <li> I have had the Braun 790 for about a month now and I am extremely happy with my daily shave. No, I don&#x27;t work for the company just a happy user. I have been using an electric razor for about 15 years. Norelco has been my brand of choice and have had ok results but needed to skip every couple of days or my face would be sore. So decided I would try another brand this time. Based on the reviews selected the Braun. Can&#x27;t speak about the newer Norelcos they may give just as good a shave but Consumer Reports magazine and the various comments rated this one highly.    What do I like?  -the closest shave I have ever gotten from an electric razor  -close shave every time whether I wash my face first or use the razor first as the company suggest  -no sore neck or face using it daily  -nice cleaning stand that does a fine job  -used on a trip and running hot water on the head seemed to do fine as well  -low energy use when cleaning when I checked it with my watt killer meter    Any concern?  -so far none to speak of  -I am still working on getting the shave on my upper lip as close as I would like. But I am figuring it out  -some mentioned the case not as handy as just a cap over the cutting blade for travel but I have found the case is just fine. same size as razor so no space difference    I am a happy camper so if it changes I will be back  with another post.    This razor is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Over the years I have used both blades and other makes of electric shavers.  However, after doing my homework in researching a quality product.  I found it with the Braun Series 7 - 790cc Pulsonic Shaver.  It is a major improvement over what I have used in the past giving me a good clean shave.  I highly recommend the product.  However, keep in mind its a little pricey but worth the extra money.    Emanuel Stein</li>
    <li> I have been using a Norelco electric for the last 20+ years but have always had occasional problems with ingrown hairs which have gotten worse recently.  So I decided to try out a Braun to see if it would do better.  At first I was having HORRIBLE problems with ingrown hairs on the Braun, I was getting a couple nasty ones every week, real nasty ones.  My neck looked like a minefield.  Just when I was about to give up I decided to try a different shaving technique.  With my old Norelco I had to make many quick passes to get all the hairs cut so that was the way I was doing it with this one.  I decided to try slowing down, and found that the vibrating head in fact made it possible to shave that way and get just as quick a shave in the end because only a couple passes were needed.  To get an idea of the speed, I now take about three seconds to run up a side cheek on my face.  Now as you have probably guessed already, that has completely solved my ingrown hair problem and I am now doing much better than I did with my old Norelco.    I have found the self-cleaning aspect handy.  I was initially concerned that I would be spending far too much money on the replacement liquid things that go in the base, but after four months of use I am still on the same one so it looks like 2-3 per year which isn&#x27;t all that horrible.

    <li> Alrighty then. I&#x27;ve had Braun razors ever since I was over playing Army in Germany in the mid- 80&#x27;s. At that time I bought a battery powered Braun for the field. It worked well then, and worked fine until I moved about three years ago and misplaced it. It&#x27;s around here somewhere, and I&#x27;ve no doubt that it&#x27;ll still work fine when I finally stumble across it someday.      Anyway, the razor that this new 790cc replaces is the 8985 360 degree complete, which still works fine, but with which I&#x27;ve grown bored. I&#x27;m sending it to my little brother (he still gets my hand-me-downs, but never complains!) where it will no doubt continue to perform well.     How does the 790 perform? In a word: peerlessly.  It powers through my not insubstantial beard with no audible slowing (generations prior to the 8985 would bog down if I tried to shave too quickly) and without having to go over the same spot several times.  It even cleans up the throat and neck area quickly and comfortably.  And... I shave my head with it and it works very, very well for that too!        I tried the 500 series Braun: not bad, but not as good as my three year old 8985.  It went back.  I tried the top-of-the-line Norelco triple head razor. Lift and cut shaving? What a crock! I&#x27;d finish with the the Norelco and go over the same area with the 8985. Smoother. The Norelco went back. So, enough screwing around!  What&#x27;s the top Braun? 790cc. I bought it and am very happy.     Notable features and differences from previous generation Braun razors:    This one can be rinsed in warm water to clean it if you don&#x27;t want to use the clean and renew station. Nice, but make sure you pop off the screen /  cutter block to dry, off of the razor. If you put it in the cleaning station to dry, it won&#x27;t, and you&#x27;ll get a cold wet razor the next time you fire it up. Yuck.     The trimmer is a new design from previous razors, and I actually prefer the old style.  This one works, but it&#x27;s weaker than previously (it will bog if you tryto go too quickly) and is harder to be precise with. I have a long sweeping mustache and if I have to mess with it, I&#x27;ll typically reach for my dedicated trimmer.      The cutter block and screen have been combined into one unit. I like it actually, as it seems to better contain the shaved material. (Remember that I shave my head, too?).  I read a review (complaint?) on here that it was more expensive to replace than before, but no, a little e-shopping and you&#x27;ll find that it&#x27;s the same as replacing the screen and cutter block. They work together, get dull together, and should  be replaced at the same time. If your scissor gets dull, you don&#x27;t sharpen one blade, right? Same principle.      This razor is powered by a lithium polymer battery, where prevoiusly they were powered with nickel metal hydride batts.  I wish they&#x27;d have stayed with the nimh, as I believe that they have a much longer lifespan. I actually think that the battery will be the longevity limiting factor with this razor.  Will I grow bored with this razor and be looking for the next generation, better Braun before the battery croaks? I&#x27;m not so sure.  Maybe they can re-power it a service center.    The razor has an LCD display on the bottom that shows remaining battery power, and the cleanliness of the razor. Pretty nifty. Each scale (six segments in a little curved line) gets reset when the Clean and Renew station is used to clean/lubricate and charge the razor (Like having a brand new razor each time!), but not when it&#x27;s rinsed in warm water.  That&#x27;s another complaint that people make: you have to pay for the cartridges to refill the cleaning station.  Whoopie doo. They last about two months each, and they cost about ten bucks for two.  A little over two bucks a month to keep it in tip top shape. Again, whoopie doo. You don&#x27;t have to use the station, but why buy this razor at all if you don&#x27;t plan on using the cleaning function?    To finish, I would whole-heartedly recommend this razor to anyonewho wants a smooth, non irritating shave. Is it as close as a good blade? Nope. It can&#x27;t be. As thin as they make the screen, it&#x27;s still there, and it&#x27;s between the cutter and your skin. But it&#x27;s darned close, and I don&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s a better electric out there anywhere!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned two electrics razors, both Norelco&#x27;s.  Norelco #2, a 6-year old top of the line 8894XL, was starting to have trouble holding a charge, so I decided to buy a Braun 790cc because of its good reviews,  Big mistake.  The Braun is a quality razor that looks good and feels great.  It did a good job on my face, but a terrible job on my neck.  I was very careful to follow the instructions in the Braun user guide to make sure I wasn&#x27;t the problem, but there was nothing I could do to get a decent shave on my neck.      After three weeks of trying, I called the 800 number you have to call to return the razor.  I thought they&#x27;d ask me why I wanted to return the razor and maybe suggest something new to try.  Wrong again.  I reached a recorded message that, after some of the usual voice mail exercises, spit out  return instructions at something just short of the speed of light.  After spitting out the message, the recording then abruptly hung up; no dial &#x60;*&#x27; option to repeat the message.  The recording didn&#x27;t bother to spell words that could easily be misspelled, such as Genco, Jenco, or Gen. Co.  After lots of redials and some Internet detective work, I think I got the return address right.  I&#x27;m not at all sure that was Braun&#x27;s intention.   I did eventually receive my refund within the expected timeframe    Since I still needed a razor, I ordered my second choice, a Norelco 1090x.  I finally got it right.  This thing does a great job on both my face and neck,  It&#x27;s not baby smooth, but it&#x27;s in the ballpark.  Now my wife doesn&#x27;t have to complain about the Braun cleaning thing sitting on the counter all the time (I didn&#x27;t like it either) and I don&#x27;t have to spend $7 a month to buy cleaning refills.  The Norelco did got a little warm for a while, but that stopped after a few weeks.  Other than that, it&#x27;s easily the best electric razor I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> I always buy the top of the line shavers from different companies and they all lasted for years with no problems.  The only reason I replaced them was because the battery no longer took a charge.  After 2 years of light use, the trimmer broke (it no longer was able to stay open) and the cleaning fluid dissolved the cheap silver sticker behind the shaver.  This shaver shaves no closer than other brands that I have used in the past.  The quality of construction is very poor.  I would definitely not recommend this shaver to anyone.  I have been using foil shavers for 25 years and will purchase a rotary shaver for the first time in my life because I thought this was the best foil shaver.[[ASIN:B000Q6SU3C Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic  Shaver]]</li>
    <li> This review is for the Braun 7-790cc electric shaver.  Highly recommended.  Worth every penny.    The last foil shaver I tried was a really old model which my grandfather left to me, about 10 years ago.  I tried it once and brutally cut up my face.  Which explains why my last shaver was a high end Norelco rotary shaver (don&#x27;t recall the exact model number).  I had that shaver for about four or five years.  Initially, it shaved pretty well, but over time, even though I replaced the cutters every year, and thoroughly cleaned the shaver from time to time (hard to do when they discontinued the cleaning solution), the shaving performance degraded.  I ended up having to finish up some parts of my face with a razor.  Also, the tradeoff for setting the shaver for a reasonably close shave was that my skin would often get irritated, especially since I would have to do multiple passes to try to do a somewhat reasonable job.  It was time to purchase a new shaver, and I considered purchasing this model, but I was nervous, because of the expense, and because it would be my first foil shaver.    I read the reviews of the Braun and decided to give it a try.    I have been satisfied with the closeness of the Braun shave, and extremely satisfied with the comfortable shave and the ease of cleaning.  I started off the first few weeks being very gentle and careful with the shaver, not pressing too hard.  It is recommended that you stretch the skin and hold the shaver perpendicular to your face.  After a few weeks, I became more comfortable with the shaver and started to press harder.  I recently got my very first nick with the shaver.  I had stretched the skin, but apparently pressed a little too hard, and I felt it nick me right on the end of my chin.  It was just a very small nick with a little bead of blood.  Not bad at all, and I&#x27;m pretty sure I can avoid it in the future just by not pressing as hard around the bony contours of my jaw.    This shaver does not shave as close as a blade, but it does a fairly good job, and I believe it does the best job possible for an electric shaver.    The cleaning cartridges make me a little uncomfortable, because I don&#x27;t know exactly what they contain.  I believe it is alcohol plus some lubricants.  I&#x27;m not sure whether it qualifies as hazardous waste.  Each cartridge costs about $6 and lasts about a month (of daily cleanings).  You can subscribe via Amazon.com, so that you will receive a package of 2 new cartridges every 2 months, and you will get free shipping and a 15% discount by doing so.  The cleaning system activates the shaver and draws the cleaning solution from the cartridge into the shaver, in order to flush it out.  The noise of the cleaning system is a little bit annoying, due to a high-pitched whine, but I am fairly sensitive to those sorts of noises.  It&#x27;s acceptable to me (and my cat), so I don&#x27;t think this would be a deal-breaker for the great majority of people.  You would not want to start the cleaning cycle while your partner is trying to sleep in the next room.  After cleaning, the next day there sometimes seems to be a very small amount of alcohol/lubricant residue on the shaver itself, and a little bit of odor from the cleaning system, but it&#x27;s not bothersome.  It is quite a luxury not to have to clean the shaver manually (although it is possible to do so while traveling and away from the cleaning center).    Here are the cleaning cartridges, which are available from Amazon.com (free shipping via Amazon Prime or by subscribing to the product):    [[ASIN:B000050FDY Braun Clean &amp; Renew Refills (2 Pack)]]    My particular model (7-790cc) has a fast cleaning cycle, which I doubt I will ever use.  The reason is that I don&#x27;t want to use the shaver immediately after it has been cleaned, because I&#x27;m concerned that the used cleaning solution may not have completely drained or evaporated from the shaver.    I am hoping that by cleaning the shaver regularly and replacing the foil and cutters every 18 months, it will keep shaving this well for years to come.  I&#x27;m very happy I tried out this foil shaver.  I shave every day, which makes my partner happy.  I look better.  My face doesn&#x27;t get all red and irritated.  I don&#x27;t have to finish up with a razor.  I do have to do multiple passes on my neck, and particularly on my sideburns for some reason, in order to find the best angle to approach the hair, but this doesn&#x27;t bother me, because my face doesn&#x27;t get irritated.  I think it takes me about 5 minutes to shave, and it&#x27;s a very comfortable experience without any fear of nicks, cuts, or irritation.    The shaver itself also looks very impressive.</li>
    <li> WOW - best shave ever! Pressing down against the grain gives me a smoother shave than the Gillette 5 blade razor!! Independent judge (wife) confirms smoother shave. ;-)  No face burn at all. Can shave my evening shadow, without my face \\&quot;objecting\\&quot; with little morning white heads.  Shaving now quicker, easier, and aftershave is no longer painful at all.  As a design engineer I am impressed with the cleaning/lubricating system.  Thank you Braun and Gillette for making a daily chore quicker and easier!</li>
    <li> I have had my new Braun Series 7 for 13 months now and absolutely love it.  I am not one to rave about a shaver and was a Norelco user for the past 20 years.  This was my first Braun shaver and I am very impressed!    At the one year mark my razor&#x27;s charger/cleaner stopped making the connection to the charging/cleaning components.  It has a two year warranty so I just took it in to the local authorized dealer and it was fixed no problem.  From what I understand this is a common problem but the only problem.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a blade shaver for more than 20 years. Years ago, I dabled with a couple of electric shavers, but never felt I really got a close shave with them. With blades becoming so expensive, I decided I&#x27;d try it again and I&#x27;m glad I did.    I&#x27;ve had this shaver for about a week now and it seems to get a little better every day. The shave is fast, close and with no irritation. I don&#x27;t think I get as close a shave as I did with a blade, but the reality is you don&#x27;t need that close a shave to have a close shave. The longer I&#x27;ve used the Braun, the closer the shave has gotten. And, the convenience far outweighs the fact that it&#x27;s not quite as close as a blade. It&#x27;s certainly more than good enough.    It&#x27;s hard to find anything about it that I don&#x27;t like. It is a bit bulky and takes up room on the counter, but that&#x27;s pretty minor compared to what I&#x27;m getting out of it. The cleaning solution and cleaning cycle is straightforward though I&#x27;ve yet to change the cleaning solution.     I&#x27;m very glad I tried the Braun and so far I&#x27;m impressed with its convenience, ease of use and the results I&#x27;m getting.</li>
    <li> even better than the old one.  just suck it up and buy the fluid for changing.  IT IS LOUD (I run the cleaner while taking a shower, so less chance of waking the wife)</li>
    <li> I did multiple hours worth of research before deciding on which razor to buy. Unfortunately I&#x27;m very fair skinned, and I have rarely been able to shave in the past with a razor (believe me I have tried every kind) and not get razor burn. I even went to the dermatologist and after trying different approaches, they informed me that I was just more or less out of luck. Then I stumbled across the 790.    The pros to this product in my opinion:   -Hardly any razor burn (rarely get and and it is usually a stubble or two)  -Built well and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.  -The Hygeine meter is a nice feature, plus the self cleaning is great.    The cons:  -The 790 seems to shave my cheeks perfectly and in no time. It really does feel like a blade went over it. However when it comes to my neck, it doesn&#x27;t do as great of a job. I have tried different angles, stretching my skin, but sometimes it&#x27;s like it can&#x27;t quite get my neck as smoothe. It also leaves my skin red (but only for an 30 min-hour or so because of the pressure put against it from the razor trying to get all the hairs removed).   -The clean and renew cartridges are fairly expensive, but as a word of advice, you don&#x27;t have to clean this thing after every shave! I clean it once every 2 shaves, which for me equals out to 3 times a week.  -Self cleaning can be kind of loud, so I recommend shutting the door or starting it while you are headed out of the house.    Overall, if you haven&#x27;t had any luck with a regular razor blade, then I would recommend this product. This has been without a doubt the closet I have been to obtaining a good shave without any irritation.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband.He really likes it and shaves every day again for which I am thankful.He said it gives the closet shave he has ever had with an electric and does not pinch and he likes the pulsing and cleaning features.  I am glad he is happy with it but I think it is a bit on the expensive side.AS he is the one using it and feels it is well worth whatever I paid I have to bow to his opinion. AS     long as he is happy with it so am I.</li>
    <li> First, I should point out that I&#x27;m not an electric shaver type of guy.  Every time I bought one (typically the cheap $50 kind in a Target store), it irritated my skin and didn&#x27;t get a close shave, and so I would return it.  I love manual razors, I can get every whisker, and I generally can do it without cuts.  The problem is that it does hurt, if minimally, and I thought why not give electrics one more try.    Second, I have thick facial hair.  I don&#x27;t let it grow more than 5 days because by then the stubble gets unbearably itchy and I don&#x27;t like how I look with a beard or mustache.  This may be true of most faces (what do I know), but my facial hair also grows in different directions.  For instance, hair on my face is pretty simple (grows down) but hair on my neck generally grows diagonally down away from the chin (with some fun exceptions that take a few rubs of the fingertips to figure out the best angle to shave at those trouble spots).  I also lift my chin to get my neck skin taught to shave, and around the jawline I sometimes like to tilt my head up or down to move my jawbone a few inches underneath my skin so I have a hard surface to shave my jawline against (makes it easier to use less pressure and thus not cut myself).  Again, manual razors do the trick relatively easily (now that I know which direction to shave on different parts of my face) although I&#x27;d prefer to avoid the minimal discomfort that comes with a manual.  WHICH IS TO SAY, i have no doubt that your experience with this razor may be much more positive if your don&#x27;t get much facial hair.    Enter the Braun Series 7 - 790cc.  I decided, hey, if I&#x27;m going to really give this a shot, I should get the best, and, let&#x27;s face it, everyone on the internet seems to be falling over themselves to point out how perfect this shaver is compared to its competition (generally people seem to agree that foil shavers are superior to rotary, particularly for more coarse hair, and that dry shavers are better than one&#x27;s for the shower -- and this has been claimed by many to be the best dry foil shaver on the market by far).  I also read up on the art of electric shaving, including the importance of a dry face (yes, I tried Lectric Shave liquid a few times, as some recommend to dry the face), the possible value of showering first and then drying your face before shaving, using the shaver well over a month to allow your face to adjust to it, doing the trouble spots first (in my case below my jawline) before the shaver head gets warm and thus more irritating to the skin, and pulling skin taught where necessary during shaving.    THE GENERAL PROBLEM WITH THIS SHAVER -- for me at least, given my facial hair type -- is that it shaves my face perfectly but, starting just above the jaw line, it misses a large number of long hairs.  Imagine, if you will, a nearly perfect shave (my god it does my cheeks and mustache like it got waxed or something, that was kind of awesome) on my whole face, except there are 50 or so longish hairs in random spots starting just above my jaw line and continuing down my neck.  It looks absolutely ridiculous!  Believe me, I ran the shaver over those bad boys in every way I could think, every angle, every pressure, multiple times.  I even took a tweezer to try to pull those hairs away from my skin to see if the shaver would then have an easier time catching them, all to no avail.    So ultimately every time I used that shaver I&#x27;d have to do a follow-up shave with a manual shaver.  Granted, that follow-up manual shave went so smoothly, quickly, and painlessly that I could tell the electric had done most of the work, but isn&#x27;t it silly to spend so much time with the electric (almost as much time as a manual), then lather up your face right afterwords and do yet another shave with a manual, thus doubling my shave time?    I really REALLY wish there was a way to make the shave less close.  I know that sounds completely idiotic, but, remember, in my case having a close shave on most of my face but not in random spots looks silly.  I&#x27;d trade that bizarre look in easily for a less close shave that was at least even.  I mean, if I could go from Day5-level stubble back to even Day2 or Day3-level stubble, I&#x27;d go for it (I&#x27;m not in a profession where I need to be cleanly shaven every morning).  Funny thing is that I read online that the U.S. version of this shaver is the old version in parts of Asia (Japan I think?) where the newer version (in black) has three closeness-levels for shaving.  So perhaps if that version ever hits the U.S. market, the level that will leave stubble will allow for a more even shave (if not necessarily perfectly close to the skin).    Okay, on to the pluses (although if you had the experience I had, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re regretting buying this).  (1) It&#x27;s a wiz on the upper part of my face (cheeks and mustache), and I literally mean as close as a manual.  Why would I only shave my upper part of my face and not my neck and jawline though is beyond me.  The only upside I suppose is if you prefer the look of stubble everywhere but your mustache -- in which case this is a very expensive but excellent way to get rid of just your mustache hair in a fast, painless process.  (2) It&#x27;s pretty!  I know that sounds stupid, but I like electronics.  This thing is just gorgeous (I got this one, the one with the black-ish sides and back, not the one with the grey sides and back).  It feels good in your hand, beautifully designed on the exterior, and the cleaning system is fun and easy to use.    IN CONCLUSION, this is probably an awesome product for SOME people, depending on your facial hair type.  But I can&#x27;t imagine I&#x27;m the only one who has had this problem of getting a clean shave on top and an awful shave on the neck and jaw, which is why I was surprised I couldn&#x27;t find anyone else saying this in their user reviews before I bought this.  Hopefully this review will at least give you a head&#x27;s up that this is not a one-shaver-fits-all-faces product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used about every major brand of electric razor on the market over the past 30 or so years.  This, by far, gives me the best shave of any.  While the cleaning solution is somewhat pricey also, if you are not on a tight budget, its ease and convenience is also a real plus.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for about a month and it&#x27;s working great. It&#x27;s quiet and gives a close, very comfortable shave. My only quibble is that, like previous Braun shavers I&#x27;ve owned, it doesn&#x27;t always grab the neck hair and I occasionaly have to pull out the straight edge. The cleaning system has been great so far, and I&#x27;ve usually been able to clean it every other day on the \\&quot;economy\\&quot; setting instead of the recommended daily cleaning, effectively doubling the life of the cleaning solution.</li>
    <li> I like this razor better than  the Series 5 (8995) because it is much smoother to the face therefore my face is less irritated which is why shave with an electric razor in the first place. Having said that I must say that in terms of shaving performance there is not much difference, you still have to repeat areas to get a really close shave. Overall I am happy with this product and I would recommend it to anyone who gets easily irritated skin, if you are just buying it to replace the 5(8995) I would not probably do it again</li>
    <li> I have had problems with bumps and ingrown hairs since i started shaving. Have not had any since I got this shaver.    I do have to use a normal Gillette to fix my goatee but my skin feels great now.</li>
    <li> I waited a few months before making my final assessment on this product. Heck, the box even says \\&quot;wait a couple weeks to notice full results\\&quot;. As a quick background, I have a sensitive neck. My face can take a quad blade, but a single blade tears up my neck. I developed rash after every shave with a blade and I would go to work some days without shaving much to my boss&#x27; dismay. Every swipe hurt, no matter how gentle or what pace.     I had enough and I decided to buy this razor. I wanted the best of the best, money&#x27;s no object, go for the gold. I was not disappointed! This thing leaves my face smoother than what I felt with a blade and it doesn&#x27;t hurt! I am no longer afraid to shave.    My *only* gripe is that, while the quality of shave on my face is bar none, the neck isn&#x27;t the same. It leaves a lot of spots and it takes many additional swipes on stretched skin and even then it leaves a lot behind. My neck comes out splotchy. But that is how it was when I used a blade, so I am happy because I get the same results with no pain, irritation, rash, or embarassment.    Even though it is expensive, the build quality is amazing. So while you put a lot of money down on it now, I have no doubts it will last me many many years to come (and pays for itself).    Great product! Recommended for those with overly sensitive necks.</li>
    <li> I have been using Remington shavers for years and decided to step up to a better product....so I thought.  This Braun seems put together well, runs great, and the cleaning operation seemed to work well but left a little residue on the screen.  That being said this product doesn&#x27;t shave as well as my old Remington and cost 3 times as much so I will be going back.  The Remington is also better at cleaning up any longer growth and trimming neck lines etc.  I found that the Braun was ok in flat areas like the cheek but lacked in the neck area, the ability to actually shave if you have let your hair grow for several days, and just getting a close shave.</li>
    <li> After two weeks shaving with the 790CC, it amazes me.  Fast, close, comfortable.  The best shaves I&#x27;ve had in years---after enduring blades, an earlier Braun system, and rotary gizmos.  That auto clean really works---fast, clean, out-of-mind.  Had to stop using blade razors when I started Rx blood thinners.    The price is shockingly high.  Now I&#x27;ll see if this Braun is a good buy by providing superior performance over time.  Time will tell.  What is more expensive: a shaver at half or quarter the price that does not work?</li>
    <li> I have not used an electric razor since the mid 60&#x27;s. At that time my father purchased the leading triple head shaver for me. Maybe it was my youthfulness but this shaver turned my neck and upper jaw into ground meat. Since purchasing the Braun I have not had a single complaint. The unit provides a clean, smooth shave without any skin irritation. The base unit does an excepetional job in cleaning the shaver and preparing it for my next use. I would highly reccomend the unit for a novice or a long time user.</li>
    <li> had to drive to a warranty repair shop and they fixed it with a new head in about 10 minutes. says something for their support. close shave, really close. no break in period for my face; knocked down a 3 day growth without a nick, miss or problem. Pricey against the competition but after reading the reviews of the competition i chose to spend the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;glad i did</li>
    <li> I received the 790cc as a gift 2 months ago.  At first, I was impressed with the amount of thought that went into the packaging of this unit.  Then I found out how much the razor cost and now know that most of the cost went into packaging.  As for the razor, the weight of the unit suggests that this is a well made, precision instrument. It feels solid in your hand.    After the initial charging in the clean/renew station I tried it out on my beard which was previously trimmed by my Norelco.  The resulting shave was not as close as I expected for a $200+ razor compared to my old $50 Norelco. After the first shave, I set it back into the clean/renew station and that&#x27;s when the real problems began.  All of the LED&#x27;s in the razor and the station began blinking randomly.  The charger would not sense the razor and therefore would not clean or charge it.  I called Braun and was informed that I could mail it back to them at my own expense or I could take it to their authorized repairman about 10 miles from my house. I chose the repairman.  The repairman had the razor for one month to the day and he remarked that it was not the only Braun 790cc he received for repair recently.  He told me he replaced a PC board and another part in the station when he returned the unit to me.  Thankfully there was no cost but also no paperwork describing his repair work.    When I returned home I found that he had given me somebody else&#x27;s 790cc razor.  So now, I had to return to the repairman to retrieve my razor. After returning home again, I tried the razor a second time.  I was still not impressed with the closeness of the shave but am willing to give it some more time to see if it improves. I haven&#x27;t thrown my Norelco away, yet.    The charging/cleaning station now works but has to be encouraged at times to sense the razor and to begin cleaning.  The cleaning cycle begins and will stop abrubtly.  After repositioning the razor on the contacts and pushing the start cleaning button again, itwill resume cleaning and eventually complete the cycle.  The clean/renew process is not a quiet process, either.   Bottom line: I am disappointed with Braun and Proctor and Gamble in general.  It seems to me that P&amp;G could at least stand by their products a little better, especially with a brand name like Braun.  I am also not impressed with the design of the razor&#x27;s seemingly unnecessary clean/renew station.  Why not just run the razor under hot water and put a couple of drops of oil on it every month?  The instructions indicate that you can do just that.  You really shouldn&#x27;t have the extra expense of replacing cleaning cartridges on top of this overpriced shaver, either.</li>
    <li> No skin rash, no hassle with ridiculously expensive cartridge replacements, no rapid re-growth of grizzly beard the next morning after shaving and ultimately no mess! This is the one for all man&#x27;s dream. If there&#x27;s any complaint, it is either the unit is defective or the user didn&#x27;t give the shaver enough time to adjust. I have tried the Braun series 3 because it was half the price of the series 7 but the 7 series made it to the peak. I never tried the other brand shaver because I liked the design by Braun.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my shaver over a month, and I totally love it. I highly reccomend it to anyone. It shaves great, and NO MANUAL CLEANING!! Just stick it in the base and let it do the cleaning, could not be easier.</li>
    <li> VERY NICE RAZOR.I HAVE HAD SEVERAL BRAUN RAZORS.  THIS IS THE BEST.  IT KNOWS WHEN IT NEEDS TO BE CLEANED AND CHARGED AND DOES IT.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this razor everyday and loves it. If you keep it clean and change the razor head once every few years it will last forever.</li>
    <li> The best razor, electronic or otherwise, money can buy.  It works, it leaves no bumps, and it is comfortable.  For those who are used to wet-shaving with a razor and shaving-cream, it will take time to get used to this product.  After a while, though, you will appreciate the convenience of just waking up and shaving dry with this electric razor:  no beard prep, no creams, no gels, no water.  And like I said, it is actually comfortable, shaves darned close (almost as good as the best razors), and leaves no bumps!  The self-cleaning function in the base works fantastic, too.  This electric razor is practically no-maintenance.  I have to deduct a star for the terrible, cheesy sucker-punch that Braun pulled on its customers by forcing you to replace the refills every month.  I have heard that there are ways to avoid this by refilling the refill boxes yourself somehow with an alternative liquid concoction, but I haven&#x27;t tried it myself.  I might, though, since the refills are expensive and need replacing monthly.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver as a gift for my husband, who has very sensitive skin. He used to get razor burn and ingrown hair when he shaved using his Gillette blades. His skin has improved a lot ever since he started using this shaver. He likes the swiveling head that makes it easy to shave on his neck. Its recharging and cleaning dock leaves the shaver smelling fresh and feeling new. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> [updated July 11, 2012]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returned my [[ASIN:B0020MMCB6 Braun Series 3 370 Men&#x27;s Shaver]] to the manufacturer during the trial period.  It had a great trimmer, but most trimmers I have used have been acceptable.  Otherwise, the shave and NiMh battery were not so hot and the head does not flex.  My mistake, trying to go cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous shaver had been an old 5 series that still worked some; I&#x27;d give that one 4 stars.  I once went on a 15 day vacation on this NiCad shaver without the charger, when it was a decade old, no problem.  Just had to be sure to drain the battery and then charge completely (which I eventually goofed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My new shaver was a [[ASIN:B003YJAZZ4 Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System, Silver]], which gave a good shave, but shook itself to death in 26 months.  It&#x27;s now extremely loud, but won&#x27;t drive either the current or previous head.  Trimmer was marginal, but good enough.  This shaver ran 79-80 db at six inches, close to ear damage volume.  Who knows what the equivalent vibrations were, transmitted through my face.  I decided to try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In June, 2012, I picked up a [[ASIN:B003YJB026 Braun Series 5-550cc Shaver System, Black and Silver]] on sale for one twenty at my local cost company.  Initially, I liked it&#x27;s relative quiet, but I soon became disappointed with the quality of the shave.  Shaving more carefully and taking about 50% longer helps.  I do like that the head is in two pieces (foil and cutter block), which makes shaking out the cuttings a snap.  If you are fair and young (light beard like I had in college), this model will probably be fine.  Older and tougher, not so hot.  On this and the Series 7, I use the cleaning solution about once a week and then cap the cartridge.  72 db at 6 inches, which makes it less than half as loud as the series 7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to my cost company tonight, I snagged a [[ASIN:B0067D4RYY Philips Norelco 1255x Sensotouch 3d Electric Shaver, Black,Special Value Includes Extra Shaving Head Pack]] apparently a 1250x with the extra head, on sale for one five five with a fifteen mail in rebate.  (I still have my old corded Norelco from decades ago, won&#x27;t do my &#x27;stache correctly, so I have been dubious about these shavers.)  I&#x27;ll be posting my 2 star review tonight; this sucker is going back.  (What a relief to switch back to the Series 5, even if it is slow.)  The only really good thing about the 1255x is the noise: 67 db at 6 inches is about a quarter as loud as the Series 7.  (The decibel scale is logarithmic, not linear.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------&lt;br /&gt;Update 8-12-2012:  my interpretation of the decibel scale was incorrect.  3db (not 6db) represents a doubling of the sound pressure.  I&#x27;m still using the 5-550cc, which takes at least 50% longer to produce an acceptable shave as my old Series 7.  My credit card provides an extra year of warranty and credited my full Series 7 purchase price to my card, so I&#x27;m probably going to spring for a new Series 7, keep the 5 as a spare.</li>
    <li> In anticipation of receiving my Braun, I let my beard get a five day growth. In less than five minutes I was as clean shaven as with my Gillette four blade razor. This is one of those products of which you only find a handful in your lifetime. And it doesn&#x27;t heat up while in use! The self cleaning feature is just too cool. If they ever manage to get the price down, everyone will start using a Braun, trust me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for years and this is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  You get a really close shave.  It still have some problem areas on the neck, but this is as good as I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric razor.</li>
    <li> OK, I&#x27;ve used Braun shavers for years and about 1 year ago I bought the Pulsonic. Have enjoyed it-shaves as well as promised.  Then within the last month the back under the shaver head started to deterioriate. This part comes in contact with the cleaning solution. Then the trimmer apparatus won&#x27;t close properly.   Braun will not do anything other than allow me to mail it in so they can take a look at it for 4 to 6 weeks.   Not real happy. They charge the top price in the market, and have no solution when the product fails except send it in.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried 1-4-blade wet razors, and rotary razors. All have aggravated an acne-like skin condition on my face. This is the only razor I have found that not only does not bother the problem, but actually shaves almost as closely as a blade. The cleaning solution does just that and keeps the shaver reasonably germ-free too. I&#x27;ve used the product for about a month and it is just as comfortable as Day One.</li>
    <li> I have had other Braun shavers, but none compare to this model.  It is expensive, but worth every penny.  It shaves very close and cleaning is very easy.  I will never change to any other brand.</li>
    <li> I have used this shaver for a week now and it does a great job.  I expected my skin to have some type of reaction after shaving with a blade, but there was none.  As long as you pull the skin tight and shave against the grain of your beard, it is the closest electric shaver I have used.  The jury is still out on the auto-cleaning device and how long the solution will last.  All the posts I have read about say just to bite the bullet and purchase a new one when the old one is finished.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very quiet, and does a great job.  This is my 4th Braun in maybe 25 years.  The last two, this one, the 7790c Pulsonic, and the last one, had the new screen design that I think they referred to as \\&quot;activator\\&quot;.  For my face type, I tend to have hairs growing in all different directions, and this new screen design really makes the shaving go more quickly.  In addition, in todays environment, where it is common to go a day or two without a shave, this new design makes that one or two day old stubble get cut down more quickly, and with less discomfort.    The \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; part of the shaver I think does a better job than without, but I would not say that the differece in \\&quot;night and day\\&quot;, but would say that it is an improvement.     My opinion, you will not be disappointed with this shaver.  I do not know of a better shaver, and if I did, I would own it.</li>
    <li> I am beyond pleased w/ this purchase.  I have been a &#x27;shave in the shower&#x27; kind of guy for years - my face gets really sensitive especially around the neck area.  I have been using this shaver for just about a week now, and I&#x27;m sold.  My face comes out smoother than had I used a blade.  Mind you, when I shaved with a blade I always shaved w/ the grain.  When I shave w/ this Braun, its like I was shaving against the grain w/ a blade.      Its true, the neck is a tougher area to get all the hairs on.  Every day I get a little better at it though, and I think every day my neck gets a little more used to the shaver.  I believe if I give the shaver the full 3 week adjustment period, I&#x27;ll be a real happy guy.    I even shave on the weekend with this thing.  That almost NEVER happened !!!    I could care less about needing to buy the solution - conveniance has a price and I&#x27;m willing to pay it.  I hope it lasts beyond the 2 year warranty - everything I&#x27;m reading indicates it should easily pass that mark.  One of the better purchases I&#x27;ve made all year - I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
    <li> After many years, many Panasonics, Norelcos, and previous Brauns, I have found one that just works.  This is the best shave from an electric I have ever experienced.    I hesitated at the price...but it is value for money.</li>
    <li> Product is ok but not as great as advertised, larger screen openings can catch small skin tags on your face if you have them.</li>
    <li> This razor worked great until it broke 5 months after purchase, this is when the problems started.  Pretty much Braun doesn&#x27;t stand by there product and out sources their servicing to appliance service companies.  Customer service pretty much doesn&#x27;t care. To make a long story short, after 6 weeks of waiting and many phone calls, I was sent a razor WITH HAIR IN IT, after being told I was going to be sent a new one buy customer service.  I called and after some \\&quot;investigation\\&quot; they claim they sent me back my razor, only problem is I had thoroughly cleaned my razor before bringing it to the service center. I was told maybe there was hair in it you didn&#x27;t get or from the testing they did on the razor (meaning their service centers don&#x27;t clean the testing equipment).  I called up customer service and was told to take it up with the service center.    Meanwhile, i have been shaving with a $60 Norleco that I purchased about 4 years ago (that broke and was replaced with no problems).      FOR THE COST OF THE PRODUCT THE SERVICE WHEN IT FAILS IS HORRIBLE! BEWARE!</li>
    <li> excellent shaver! it does what it claims to do. shaver helps keep your skin feeling not to dry.i would recommend this shaver without any doubts.</li>
    <li> My Series 5 shaver broke after I dropped it a few too many times on the tile floor so I replaced it with the Series 7 shaver. The series 7 shaver is a tiny bit better at shaving my thick growth then the series 5 only b/c it takes a few minutes less time for me to shave. That leads me to the minor complaints about the Series 7...Braun took the shave timer off of this shaver, for some odd reason I really liked the timer. The new shaver has a slight flimsy feel to it compared to the old one. I also don&#x27;t like the trimmer on the 7 compared to the trimmer on the 5. Braun did put an angled plug on the 7 and that&#x27;s nice b/c it fits closer to the wall on my counter now...if they would fix the size/shape of the electric plug then it would be almost perfect (both the 5 and 7 have the same plug and it&#x27;s really long, so it sticks out from the outlet really far...very ugly and in the way). Overall, this is still my favorite electric shaver and I&#x27;ve tried many over the years. I wouldn&#x27;t upgrade from a working Series 5 to the Series 7 b/c the performance is very similar.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this shaver for about three weeks but I wanted to submit a review in case it might be helpful to someone shopping for the holidays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hadn&#x27;t used an electric shaver for decades and my previous experience with electric razors has been disappointing. I had plastic surgery involving my neck relatively recently and because of the bumps and valleys left behind it&#x27;s rather uncomfortable using a razor blade. I got this model because the reviews were good and I didn&#x27;t want to take a chance on a personal hygiene product which wasn&#x27;t highly rated. Price wasn&#x27;t a concern as long as the shaver worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has met my expectations. Let me say right off that it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a razor blade. I doubt if any electric razor would, at least with my beard. However, it gets pretty darn close, especially if I make several passes over the same area. It comfortable and I don&#x27;t have irritation afterward. My wife doesn&#x27;t notice any difference in the shave whether I use the electric shaver or a razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m retired, so this has been very useful for routine use. The shave is plenty good enough for seeing the grandkids or going out with friends. I&#x27;ve used a razor blade a few times for special social events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers have expressed concern regarding the self cleaning system (and the cost of the proprietary cartridges). I think the unit looks rather attractive and high tech and it operates flawlessly. One doesn&#x27;t have to use the self cleaning option for every shave. Just rinse the razor under water and use the self cleaning system intermittently as desired. The cartridges contain some lubricants so I suppose it&#x27;s a good idea to use it once in awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t comment on how well this razor compares to other brands because I haven&#x27;t used any other recent models. I can say that I&#x27;m satisfied with this purchase and I doubt that I could find a competing brand with better performance.</li>
    <li> NON-RETURNABLE. Don&#x27;t miss the fine print. If you are buying this as a gift, you better be sure the recipient wants it. It is loud and vibrates a lot. If you decide you don&#x27;t want it, then you CANNOT return it. Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> My husband bought this for his own Xmas present and loves it.  He has had a Braun 7526 for a number of years and after reading the other reviews decided to upgrade.  Shaved one side of his face with the 7526 and the other with the 9595.  I could definitely tell the difference especially around the neck.  He said it was much quicker as well, without having to go over areas several times.  His old Braun has been very reliable and is expecting similar reliability with a closer shave.  Go Braun!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a few of the Braun razors over the past 7 years.  I started with a series 5 that finally died last year, and over the last year I used a series 1 while I decided if I wanted to buy a really expensive razor again.  I will start out that this is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever shaved with.  It consistently cleans up any trouble hairs without any input from you; unlike the previous systems you don&#x27;t need to \\&quot;grind\\&quot; the razor into your neck to get rid of those hairs.  It also manages an average day&#x27;s growth in one pass; that is a welcome change from the previous iterations.  The LCD is neat; more gimmicky than anything else but kindof cool.  The base station is similar to all the others with the addition of a \\&quot;quick clean\\&quot; option.  I dunno if I&#x27;ll ever use that; having shaved with the alcohol leaking onto my neck before... It&#x27;s not comfortable!  It also comes with a travel case of hard plastic that completely covers the razor; it also has the cleaning brush built into the end of it.  The razor itself is well-made.  The finish is good and it has some heft to the device.  It doesn&#x27;t feel like if you hold it wrong you&#x27;re going to break it.  The razor head looks very complicated when you take it off too.  This is a remarkable piece of engineering.    The only downside to it is cost.  It&#x27;s an expensive razor!  I thought good and hard before purchasing it.  I think what finally sold me was the conclusion, offered helpfully from my wife, that I shave every day and deserve a good, clean shave.  I really had come to dread shaving every day with my series 1 and needed a good replacement.  I liked my series 5, but it wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; in that I still received razor burn from it.  I decided this was the razor to get and bought it.  I was not disappointed and I don&#x27;t think you will be either.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t imagine why this razor gets the high reviews it does.  It takes me 10-15 minutes to shave with it.  I have normal hair and have never had a problem with shaving.  OK, it cleans...great.  As far as a razor is concerned, it&#x27;s only adequate.</li>
    <li> I just want to start out saying that I have very sensitive skin; especially on the neck.  I tried each of these shavers for 1 month.  This was ultimately a journey in trying to find the best electric shaver.  Thank God for money back guarantees or I would have gone broke in this process.  Ultimately I felt that the Braun Pulsonic was the best of these shavers and the one I continue to use.    Philips Norelco 8240xl  -Really not a bad shaver.  It is very quiet and the shave was fairly comfortable and quick.  Also, it&#x27;s not that expensive and is a good value for the price.      Pros:   -gives a decent shaver overall  -quick shave  -fairly comfortable  -very easy to clean    Cons:  -had trouble getting all my neck hairs (had to keep going over neck)  -any more than a days worth of stubble and this thing will tug on your facial hair (hurts a little bit)      Panasonic 8243a wet/dry shaver  -not at all worth the money in my case  -I know alot of people like this shaver and I really wanted to but the actual performance of it led me to decide otherwise    Pros:  -ability to use shaving cream with this shaver reduces irritation  -does a decent job on the face  -shaves fairly close    Cons:  -used the shaver for one month and I always got ingrown hairs on my neck and jaw line after shaving with it  -frequently nicked my neck and jawline, drawing blood  -pretty loud      Philips Norelco Arcitec  -really not worth the money and overall gave a mediocre shave  -the 8240xl was a better shaver for my face    Pros:  -decent shave on the face  -shave was quick  -easy to clean    Cons:  -doesn&#x27;t shave that close for such a high end shaver  -very poor job on the neck (irritated my neck, always missed many neck hairs in spite of repeated passes)  -way to much money when the performance is not even as good as the 8240xl (looks like Philips paid too much attention to design and not enough on performance for this one)      Braun Pulsonic  -The hands down winner and best electric shaver Ihave used to date.  Before I used the other shavers I bought this one first about 6 months ago and used it for a month.  I initially felt that this did a very good job of shaving my face but wondered if I could find a better shaver for a cheaper price, so I sent the shaver back to Braun after a month.  After having used the other shavers, I purchased the Braun Pulsonic again and continue to be happy with its shaving performance    Pros:  -very good shave for an electric shaver (if I take the time, can get almost as close as a blade)  -does not irritate my skin (even with repeated passes, that includes the neck)  -shave is very smooth and comfortable  -once your face adjusts to the shaver, the shave is fairly quick  -cleaning station is very convenient        -say what you will, it might seem unnecssary but it really is convenient, it lubricates the shaving head for a smooth shave,     and it leaves the shaver head smelling nice and lemony    Cons:  -would be nicer if this shaver was cheaper  -this thing is loud, too loud  -the shaver head gets warm and quickly (tip: if head gets to hot, hold it in front of a fan for 10 seconds, cools right down)      -when I shave when the shaver head gets really warm it irritates my skin unless I let the shaver cool down     So the Pulsonic is the winner and even though this shaver is expensive, I was happy to pay the money for its superior performance to the other shavers.  I also want to point out that the only difference between the Pulsonic 790cc and 760cc is that the 790cc has an lcd screen that shows power level and hygiene level and the 760cc has an led screen where led lights simply light up to indicate battery life.  To me, the hygiene level on the 790cc is pointless; I mean, does someone really need to be reminded to clean their shaver.</li>
    <li> At first this shaver worked well.  However, the blades dulled quickly, the battery died, and the trimmer broke off the shaver.  A Braun authorized repair company fixed the trimmer but claimed the battery was fine - notwithstanding the fact that the battery dies mid-shave unless I plug the shaver into an outlet.  Given the price, the quality control is unacceptable.  I would never buy this shaver again.</li>
    <li> I had been using a Norelco and was a bit cautious at first.  However after shaving with this razor I was amazed at the speed and closeness of the shave.  Believe it or not it gives a shave comparable to a blade with no razor burn.  The cleaning feature is excellent.  If you haven&#x27;t tried a Braun type shaver recently you don&#x27;t know how improved they are.  If there is one down side to it, it is the pop-up trimmer.  It&#x27;s placement puts it where you have trouble seeing it and makes it harder to use for trimming.</li>
    <li> Great close save for an electric razor. Only thing thats bad about this product is that to use the automatic cleaner you need to purchase a $5 cartridge that needs to be replaced every month.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Braun Series 7 for my boyfriend as a gift and he loves it.  He had an old Braun shaver before I purchased this one and it was barely getting the job done and barely stayed charged long enough for one shave.  He and I can both tell that the Series 7 gives him a much closer, cleaner, smoother shave.  The self cleaning feature is also really nice.  His only complaint, if we had to list one, is that he wished the compartment that holds the alcohol for the self cleaning was bigger so that he didn&#x27;t have to replace it as often.  Personally, I like that it&#x27;s smaller because you&#x27;re &#x27;forced&#x27; to replace the dirty alcohol more frequently.  Also, when I purchased it, it was over $200, but I still think it was totally worth it and I know my boyfriend is very happy with it.    (The reviewer was compensated for posting this review.  However, the opinion stated in the review is that of the reviewer and the reviewer alone. Further, the reviewer independently selected this product to review and has no affiliation with the product maker/distributor, Amazon or the review requester.)</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried an electric shaver in many years, remembering how poorly they worked.  The Braun 790cc is--in a word--amazing!  It truly results in a shave so close to a razor that I had to have my wife verify it by rubbing her cheek against mine and she agreed.    It is expensive and the cleaner cartridges add to the cost, but as for results--if that is what is important to you--it&#x27;s there.  Now everyone needs to decide for themselves how important cost is.  That simplifies the decision at least.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my husband as a gift. He is very satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Great shaver with plenty of power and a smart clean/charge system.  I was used to a trimmer that comes straight out, but after getting used to this one, it works great.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I was a little reluctant to sink $240.00 into another Braun shaver. I own the Braun 8595 which I rated 4 out of 5 stars because it missed hairs at the middle, bottom of neck and under the chin. Usually I would have to use the pop-up trimmer to get these areas shaved clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 9595 exceeded my expectations. Braun has done it! This shaver gives a great shave. You will love this shaver and the shave it gives. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> My husband is very happy with this shaver.  He had a lesser model of a Braun and didn&#x27;t like the shave.  He says he really likes this model.  Doesn&#x27;t pull the hair and cuts closely.  A good product.  Worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wet shaved all my life except when I was a teenager, and I&#x27;ve always envied those who just grab an electric shaver, whisk it over their faces, and hit the door, so thought I&#x27;d try it. The Braun scored highest in quality and satisfaction, so I got this shaver, the top of the line, and gave it a go. I decided to keep at it for several weeks, since it takes time for the beard to become used to a new way of shaving, but by the time my 30 days in which I could get a full refund were up, I sent it back. As another user noted, I had to shave every which way to get at all close, and my skin felt hot afterward. Finally I pulled out my old Gillette Trac III razor and shaving cream and did a comparison test. The Braun couldn&#x27;t hold a candle to the closeness and comfort afterward of a wet razor shave. So if you&#x27;re into electric shavers, this is probably the best on the market, but if you&#x27;re thinking of switching from wet shaving you might want to think again. The proof is in the feel of your face afterward, and there was really no comparison. I&#x27;m back to blades for good.</li>
    <li> I bought the new Philips Norelco 1050cc Arcitec Shaving System, returned it for a refund after 30 days, and then purchased a the new Braun Pulsonic 9595 Shaving System. Since I&#x27;ve had experience with both now, I thought my experience might be of value to others. I&#x27;ve had 3 Norelco shavers over the past 20 years. The 9595 is my first Braun shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving Closeness - The Braun definitely gives a closer shave and in less time, although the Norelco is acceptable. One reviewer commented about getting nicks from the Braun but I have not had that problem at all, even around the chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfort - The Braun feels heavier (I didn&#x27;t actually weigh them) but I found the Braun more comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noise - The Braun is noisier, especially during the cleaning cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Status Indicators on the Shaver - The indicators are better on the Braun; however, I&#x27;ve since learned that&#x27;s mostly because I had the 1050 model. I now see that the 1060 or the 1090 models would have been better and probably would equal the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charging/Cleaning Stand - The Braun is more convenient to replace the cleaning fluid but about the same cost (about $1.00 per week). Both seem to clean equally well. The charge and cleaning status lights on the Braun are easier to see and give better status information. But the big difference here is the way the charging system works. With the Braun, you simply place your used razor in the stand, push a button, and the cleaning &amp; charging are taken care of. However, with the Norelco, there are a number of warnings in the book to unplug the unit after it completes its cycle. This is a major inconvenience if you have to hang around and remember to unplug the unit. Also, the lack of an on/off switch seems a poor and cheap design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer - To even off my sideburns, I found the Norelco somewhat difficult to use because the trimmer did not stick out far enough beyond the shaving head. This was not a problem withthe Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost - The Braun cost about $20 more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Return Policy - 60 day money back with Norelco; only 30 days with Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom-Line - I started with a bias toward the Norelco because of my past experiences but in my opinion, this new Braun definitely surpasses the Norelco in terms of shaving closeness and convenience. Braun is clearly worth the extra $20, although the Norelco is a decent product.</li>
    <li> I have been using electric shavers for 50years and this by far the best, it gives a very smooth and comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> Like many people, I made the move to an eletric shaver from razors, mainly for convinience. I must say that this shaver has let me make the move and never turn back. It&#x27;s as close as you can get with eletric, and the self cleaning feature is great. I would highly recommend to those looking to make the move.</li>
    <li> The Braun Pulsonic System 9595CC is the best electric shaver I have ever owned.  And I have owned 5 pervious models. The shave is thorough and clean.  I recommend it!    Lou Ennis</li>
    <li> Far and away the best shaver I have ever had.  Better than any electric shaver OR BLADE I have tried</li>
    <li> From all the positive reviews here, I had high hopes that this razor would be my salvation from the hell that is shaving.    Sadly, after two uses, it&#x27;s as disappointing as all electric shavers have always been on my beard.    It missed everything; I had to go over each area multiple times to get any palpable reduction in beard growth; it took 3 times longer than a blade would have, and when all was said and done, my face still is not entirely smooth.    Now, I realize that it takes a few weeks for ones face to get used to a new electric razor, but if the reviews here are to be trusted, I was meant to be blown away on the first use.  To say I was underwhelmed is putting it mildly.    I will give it 3 weeks to see if my experience changes, and if it does, I will certainly update this review, but as of right now, I am soooooo saddened by the failure of this product to live up to its promise.    Granted I have the most awful beard from hell, but others here who gave this product a glowing review also claimed to have a permanent shadow before the Pulsonic came into their lives, so I was optimistic in my case as well.    I hate, hate HATE shaving, and using a blade is torture (I can&#x27;t even handle the chore every day -- I have to skip a day inbetween); however, blades work.  Electrics, sadly, don&#x27;t.    I feel duped!    The design and engineering on this system are amazing, hence the \\&quot;two stars\\&quot;, but given that it is giving me such a poor shave, that&#x27;s actually too generous.  Sigh...</li>
    <li> Have used this shaver for a couple of weeks now, bought it on Amazon for a good price (although Walmart carries it at about the same price, you save on taxes in most states on Amazon).  Its a lot better than Philips shavers I have been using for the last 5-6 years, gives me a closer shave with lesser irritation.  The shaver did leave some rashes though, I guess its perhaps a case of me getting used to the kind of pressure it needs for a good shave. Great product, highly recommended.    Update 2/4/2008:     I have been cleaning the shaver every alternate day, or when the LCD only has two lights, whichever happens earlier, and its only after 2 months of use that the cleaning fluid is showing &#x27;low&#x27; level.  Pretty happy with the cost of cleaning this shaver as well.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000Q6SU3C Braun Pulsonic System 9595 with LCD Screen]] The package as received was covered with a medium weight smooth plastic cover with no obvious beginning or end. I sat at the table for a while trying to determine how to get a handhold to get it off. Finally, after a while I attacked it with a scissors. What was left was a box with no obvious way to get it open. There did not seem to be a pull-out flap.  I discovered, after time, that it opened like a book with two halves. Inside each half was a part of the product that in some cases had to be wrestled out. No instructions on or in the box that made much sense.  After all this time, I needed a shave. Reading the instruction book and trying to figure out what some of the icons meant I assembled the two parts, cleaner and shaver, finally forced open the container containing the  cleaning fluid and inserted it into the cleaner container. Then charged the battery with the oversized charger (the plug juts about five inches out of the wall.) I waited about 1/2 hour and proceeded to shave. The shave I would rate as very good, once you get used to the excessive vibration. It did all parts of my sorry face without much effort. The cleaner worked well, but P&amp;G devised a very nice cash cow for themselves. The cleaner cartridge, they say should last 30 days at which time buy another one at $3-$4. I find this trend among manufacturers obnoxious. There must be a better way to make the original price the final price. Check other reviews. Consumers are beginning to use their heads.I remove the cartridge during the day and cover it to prevent evaporation and remove the shaver head after shaving to blow out the dust and replace it before putting it in the cleaner.  Finally, in summation, the product is grossly over packaged, very over priced, but does a good job shaving. It is not that portable because you can&#x27;t carry the cleaner with you. You can use water to clean, but then it does not get lubricated by the company&#x27;s cleaner. The plug-charger does not fit into the carrying case provided. Before committing to the \\&quot;Braun\\&quot; check out other shavers and see if they would do a good job for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 27 and I&#x27;ve been using Braun electric shavers almost daily since I started shaving my face, probably about 12 years ago. I tried Philips/Norelco wet shaving system once (Cool Skin) but I had to return it because my (apparently very sensitive) face was destroyed after just one use. My face can&#x27;t stand razors either. I wanted to replace my four years old Braun Synchro, not because it was bad, but because I was fooled by advertising, and this shaver looked promising.     Yes, the device looks nice, weighs less than my old Synchro, the movable foils seem a good thing at first, and the cleaning system looks much better (it&#x27;s still quite big, though). But I was hugely disappointed after the first use: my old (and much cheaper) Synchro shaves noticeably closer than this Pulsonic, even though its foil blade should have been replaced by now. The (few) hairs on my neck the Synchro is unable to cut, arent&#x27;t cut by the Pulsonic either. And it gets worse: my skin was much more irritated, especially on my neck, where a lot of red bumps appeared soon after shaving (I used Gillette after shave, as usually). And it happened something that has never happened to me before using an electric razor: the middle foil made a cut in my lower lip (I can&#x27;t do that with my Synchro even if I try to).    Yesterday I gave it another shot but the results were no better than the first time.    The redness and irritation might go away as soon as my face gets used to this shaver, but I doubt it will shave my face any closer in future uses.    I couldn&#x27;t care less about the looks of the shaver, its weight (as long as it&#x27;s reasonable), its battery life (I always use the power cord) or the cleaning system (I use the one that came with my Synchro very few times a year). I just want the closest shave possible without leaving my face tomato-red. And my old Synchro definately does a better job at that than this Pulsonic, so I think I&#x27;ll stick with it.    I really wanted to like this shaver, but I can&#x27;t recommend it. I understand that there are many different types of skin and beard out there, and some guys might get fantastic results with this shaver, as some others do with Philips/Norelco. But check that you can return it if you are going to buy this.</li>
    <li> This Pulsonic 9595 really is the best shaver out there, hands down.  All the other reviews cover it pretty well, but it really is the best.  Solid, sturdy construction, easy on the face, pretty much eliminates problems of ingrown hairs cuz the shave is so good.  Close shave all over, no pulling, easy on the skin.  And the cleaning system works great.  The trimmer is pretty functional too for a razor&#x27;s trimmer.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy any other razor - this is awesome and it looks cool.</li>
    <li> My friend had an older model Braun and he seemed to like it, so I thought I would give one a try.  First of all, this is a great deal compared with the series 5 that is going for $200 at Target.  The packaging is great.  The cleaner/charger base and razor has a nice clean fit and finish.  I have pretty dense facial hair so I wasn&#x27;t so sure about this, but it seems to do the job.  It does take me about 5-10 minutes to complete the shave because I usually let my hair grow out a few days.  It gets nearly as close as a razor. The only area that seems to create a problem is my neck area.  I just can&#x27;t seem to get it as close as I can with the other areas. Despite the claims on the box I can&#x27;t get my neck area close and it occasionally snags or pulls my hairs.      I think I&#x27;m learning better technique though, as it seems to not do it as much. I think my neck area just has too many hairs going in different directions. The majority of other people reviewing don&#x27;t seem to have these two problems though. I&#x27;m not so sure about the pulsonic technology and it&#x27;s capability to increase the performance though. Overall though I enjoy the convenience of the use of it. The cleaning system is great and is super easy and leaves the razor spotless and smelling great. No more messy gels/creams, cuts or cleanup for me.  The main reason I bought the shaver is since I began shaving I was plagued with razor burn/bumps which made it look like my skin was breaking out.  I hated it and no matter what technique or product I used it would not go away.  This product seems to have solved the problem and that was my main priority.  If you are speculated about buying go ahead and try it as it has a 30 day money back guarantee.</li>
    <li> I ordered this Braun Pulsonic electric razor and had delivered to an address in the US, since I was outside the country. Upon visiting I used this razor for 6 weeks before returning home. I concluded that it is way overpriced. It took just as long to shave with it than any other Braun or Norelco. The only difference I found is that it is a bit heavier, a stronger motor, and has metal parts instead of 100% plastic, thus making it appear to be worth more. I still found it insufficient in cutting hairs on the neck and around the adam&#x27;s apple. Instead of paying $200 USD I could just as well paid   $50+  less for something equivalent. I fell for some very slick marketing for sure.</li>
    <li> I read all the hype and decided to go for the \\&quot;best\\&quot; electric out there. I have an average beard and get a quick and excellent shave with this razor, but not $200 better than the Norelco I was using. My criticism is that Braun has added lots of lights, \\&quot;bells and whistles\\&quot; to the razor, and especially to the included cleaning console, which jazz up the items and the price but which are functionally insignificant or unnecessary. I can&#x27;t believe that the average guy, in a hurry to get off to the job, is going to pay any attention to things like status LEDs that give information that no one needs.  And who wants to spend $10 a month for $1 worth of cleaning alcohol and the hassle of recharging the console when hot tap water cleans effectively?    Braun should offer what is a fine razor for half the price and without the cleaning and charging console, or ridiculously overdone packaging,  for the man who values true function and doesn&#x27;t need or want the fanciful trappings. Then I would recommend it to you or my friends. For now, your money is better spent elsewhere.</li>
    <li> While it worked, it provided an acceptable shave. It could never match my 10 year old Norelco for sideburn trimming. BUT IT BROKE IN LESS THAN 3 MONTHS. I&#x27;ll nver waste my money on a product from this company again.</li>
    <li> The razer was a Christmas present for my husband who has really sensative skin and would break out every time he shaved with a coventional razer. I knew he would never buy this on his own because of the price but I thought because Christmas was coming up (and the razer was on sale) I would get it for him. It took a little over a week for his face to get used to the electric razer but the results are above and beyond his expectations. Electric razers in the past pulled his facial hair and irritated his face and neck but this one doesn&#x27;t do that. The shave is not as close as a traditional razer but it&#x27;s pretty darn close. Yes it is a little pricey but it is well worth the money.  Shoot. . . If I had known it worked as well as it claimed I would have paid full price for it!</li>
    <li> I have tried every electric razor on the market, including all of the Brauns.  This Pulsonic system is the BEST shave of all of them; by far! Great job P&amp;G / Braun!</li>
    <li> Both my father and I received the Braun 9595 Shaving System as gifts just recently.  Neither of us have ever experienced a shave as good as the Braun 9595 with the exception of a hot lather razor shave.  The Braun shaver provides a shave that is close to that of a razor shave.  After shaving, I rinse the shaver head at the faucet and return the shaver to the cleaning system for the final cleaning.  This works great for both my dad &amp; I.  We always have a clean shaver ready for the next shave.  Thank you Braun.</li>
    <li> Many years ago I had tried an electric shaver, which did not shave very well and left me with razer burn. At that time I switched back to a razor blade. I recently started shaving my head and had been cutting myself alot lately so I decided I would try the electric shaver again. After seeing a pulsonic commercial and reading the reviews here I bought one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does work pretty well, not as good as a razer blade. I do find that the hairs on my chin seem to be very difficult to trim. This shaver works very well on my head, although towards the end, the foil does feel much warmer. Since I have changed I have not cut myself shaving. The shave is not as close as the 3 blade razer, but it cuts close enough to keep me presentable. If someone was looking for an electric shaver I would reccomend this one, but it does still fall short with compared to using a blade.</li>
    <li> A little over priced. But if you are willing to spend the money then this is a great product for you. Very close easy shave. Excellent shaver.</li>
    <li> I bought this product as a gift for my husband and he seems to like it very much.The only complaint he has is that he needs to stretch his skin to get a closer shave. He is happy with the time he saves compared with blade shaving.</li>
    <li> I bought the Braun 9595 electric shaver with hopes that it would give my husband a close shave and not irritate his neck.  We have tried numerous other electrics in the past and the results were always unsatisfacory. The Braun does everything it says it will and my husband and his sensitive skin are delighted! The self-cleaning feature is also a plus.</li>
    <li> Best men&#x27;s electric razor I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I&#x27;ve tried &#x27;em all!  Closest shave with no discomfort.</li>
    <li> Shaving with ultrasonic power is fantastic - a close, smooth shave with almost no skin irritation.  The cleaning mode is a bit noisy and consumes the cleaning solution faster than probably necessary - but overall the system works really well.</li>
    <li> Surely the best electric razor I have used.  I have used electric razors for over 30 years and this product performs unlike anything else I have tried. With a quick growing stubble and often formed ingrown hairs, this razor is my savior.  The price is the largest hurdle to address, but for me I am glad I made the purchase.  The only other drawback I see is the system uses an internal &#x27;usage&#x27; meter.  Even if you clean the razor by hand or rinse it out, the meter will only &#x27;reset&#x27; if you use the razors own internal cleaning system (and thus use up the disposable cleaning cartridge).  But all in all, yes - to date - the best.</li>
    <li> once you get passed the inital stage of grooming your hairs from a regular razor to an electric razor it is a great shave. i recommend anyone looking for a good razor to purchase this one.</li>
    <li> I have a very tough beard. If I shave(razor) at 5AM I have a shadow by 6AM. The Braun 9595 is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve used so far. The shave gives me a very smooth shave that lasts most of the day. If I choose not to use my safety razor (for the closest shave I can get) I will shave with the Braun twice in a day. The pop-up trimmer allows me to get to some difficult spots and trims very easily. Braun has made the cleaning and charging a snap. Plug the shaver in, charge, clean afterwards and get one of the best shaves possible!</li>
    <li> I am 54 years old... travel constantly... in hotels, etc... so far this shaver has held its charge for almost a week at a time... it is QUIET...nice, does not wake my wife in the morning! Seems very durable, but comes with a nice hard plastic case for travel...great idea! Very close shave and no abrasive feeling.... easy to clean... big bonus! Pricey yes... but worth every cent... my last Braun lasted 15 years... am hoping to get that much at least out of this one! Jury still out on how long it will be until i have to buy a new blade attachment... have not had it but a month...</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver 6 months ago based on the great reviews in Amazon.  My experience has not been that great. The shaver has trouble picking up longer hair, and I find myself going over rough spots in the evening.  When I left the shaver at a friends and had to use my \\&quot;worn out\\&quot; Norelco I was stuck by how much closer and more comfortable the shave was.  The Braun is also pretty noisy.</li>
    <li> Well, I admit that I am a girl and have never shaved my face once.  I am pretty much an all wax girl with very light hair color, so an electric shaver is not really on my radar screen.  BUT....I do have a brother in law and he dose have birthdays.  I purchased one of these for his last birthday and believe it or not, he loves the things.  It is the first gift I have ever bought him that he even vaguely thanked me for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brother in law has a very heavy beard.  Actually at times I wonder if my sister did not marry out of her species.  We are talking a big and hairy dude who is not all that on the bright side.  After using this shaver, he actually looks like a human..sort of.  I questioned him about the shaver and he stated he had no problems figuring out how it worked (guys, if he can figure out technique then trust me, you can too), and he felt that it shaved him as close as his razor.  We were all thrilled about this as it always sort of worries the family when he handles sharp instruments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister is happy, which if you know her, is almost an almost impossibility as she has never been happy with anything a day in her life, and this is a big plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid quite a bit more for this shaver than they are asking on Amazon so for the money I think you are getting a pretty good deal here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not know about actually using this thing, but I do know it was a great gift.</li>
    <li> I just purchased a Series 7-790 cc shaver to replace my Series 5-8995 one. I had the Series 5 for several years, replaced the foil and cutter once, and chose to purchase the Series 7 rather than again replace the parts. That has turned out to be a very good decision. The Series 7 is ergonomically superior and feels great in your hand. It will take me a while to get used to the side cutter as it is narrower than on the Series 5 but the quality of the shave is a definite improvement. I find it to be significantly closer than the Series 5. This is Braun&#x27;s best shaver yet.</li>
    <li> feels like a race car in your hand    strong powerful motor    clean smooth shave      best electric i&#x27;ve ever used</li>
    <li> I have owned at least 10 different electric razors in my time, including 5 different Braun models.  While the Pulsonic system does have some advantages  over previous \\&quot;technology\\&quot; it still doesn&#x27;t out-shave my other Braun shavers as much as I expected and hoped for considering the marketing hype and, of course, the high price.  My last Braun also had the self-cleaning system...was top of the line when I bought it a few years ago...and it works about 90% as well.&lt;br /&gt;I would have rated it 4 stars, but I factored in the value (high price) as well as the quality. If you have the type of beard I do...grows in all different directions  depending on what part of my face/neck...and also grows almost flat to my skin (as oppposed to sticking straight out) which can create ingrown hairs and difficulty getting a really close shave...you may do what I do...and that&#x27;s use more than one type of shaver at the same time.  A rotary shaver works on my neck best.  And to get a truly close shave...sometimes I even have to use a third shaver (an inexpensive braun) that happens to work particularly well on my lip and chin.  I had great hopes for the Pulsonic...that it was truly as revolutionary as the marketing hype and I could retire all my other razors...but, it&#x27;s not all that.&lt;br /&gt;The Pulsonic also takes me much longer to shave...having to go over areas several times to get a close shave.  However, I do have to say that it does shave with an easy and softer (therefore less irritating) glide over the skin...and for those whom have good success with other electric razors...this one is definitely better than previously available razors!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband, so he&#x27;s only been using it about 3 months, but it&#x27;s been great.  He says it gives a good shave and the cleaning system is almost fun.  My husband is one of those people who hates the \\&quot;everyday\\&quot; chores of life, and shaver-cleaning was well up on the list.  He loves this product!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Braun Pulsonic for about a month and some form of Remington and (Phillips)Norelco for about 55 years - The Pulsonic beats the heck out  of the varieties of those 2 brands and occasional safety razor binges. It&#x27;s a cool gizmo.    Fritz Thompson</li>
    <li> This shaver works well enough, I guess. I dont think it lived up to some of the reviews I have read. It takes many passes on some parts of my face and only a few on others. With that said, the shave is close and smooth when done. The built-in clipper works great. The cleaning feature works excellent. I have used it for several weeks now and I found myself using my old Norelco sometimes if I am in a hurry. I like the tilting head on the Braun but I like the first pass cutting better on the Norelco. The Braun looks &amp; feels well made.</li>
    <li> I upgraded my old Braun 7500 series to the new Braun Pulsonic System 9595 recently, and I must say that this new shaver has given me the best shave I ever had to date with an electric razor. The power and smoothness is awesome. No razor burn nor any problems tackling whiskers regardless of which way they grow. The cleaning system (which uses the same cleaning cartridges as older models) regulates how much cleaning is needed between shaves, saving the need to replace the cleaner too often. If you like using an electric razor this is the unit to get. Well worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun shavers exclusively for about 25 years.  And, until now, was very happy with them.  This one just doesn&#x27;t shave very well for me.  I&#x27;ve used it now for a few months hoping it would improve but it hasn&#x27;t.  Even if I make a concerted effort to get a close shave I can feel, and see, stubble - mostly around my lips.  I can remove that leftover stubble easily with my older Braun Contour 5790 shaver.  I had an even older model Braun with a dead battery but I plugged that in to see and it can also easily remove the stubble left behind by the Pulsonic.     I talked to a service rep thinking mine must be faulty but they said that was very unlikely.  It seems the Pulsonic (and its predecessor) have a completely redesigned cutting system and it just doesn&#x27;t work well for my whiskers.  I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re unusual but I guess so - perhaps they lay flatter than most - I have no idea.     It does a great job on my thinner neck hairs which the previous shavers didn&#x27;t do great on.  And, I love the feel of the Pulsonic, the sound, and the cleaning system.  But, when my five o&#x27;clock shadow appears at noon I really miss my old shaver.  I&#x27;ve given this one plenty of time - I&#x27;ll be looking to purchase something else soon.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking that it would be much better than my old clunker- it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s very loud and the vibration beats at your skin, yet is only as effective as my old razor. I&#x27;m willing to clean it myself for 200$ and less noise.</li>
    <li> For first time users...stay away... I am stuck &amp; looking to sell my item on ebay.     I will never use Electric in my life, returned back to my Gillette Fusion blade &amp; Razor. I can now see my face back how it was before I was using an Electric shaver    I know cheap shavers perform worse, but how come an Expensive High end 790CC give out a Single-Star performance. when ever I use this, I still have to use my Gillette Fusion with Foam on my neck area. &amp; also with out using any oil like\\&quot;\\&quot;LECTRIC SHAVE\\&quot;\\&quot; you will rip-off your skin.    I tried using this for 4 months, just not to complain a Great Brand.  but finally I gave-up. Braun sucks</li>
    <li> This electric razor provides a shave almost as good as a safety razor. I have never before been satisfied with an electric razor but this one has far exceeded my expectations. A bit pricey but beats lower priced ones that do not do the job.</li>
    <li> Before I purchased the Pulsonic 9595 I shaved with a razor blade because I liked the close shave that a blade allows. But unfortunately I could only shave once every 5 or 7 days so I could only enjoy a smooth face for a day or two. But that all changed when I discovered the 9595. This is an \\&quot;excellent\\&quot; electric shaver. I love it!!!! This shaver comes extremely close to that of a razor blade but not the abrasiveness of a blade which allows me to enjoy a smooth face \\&quot;everyday\\&quot;. When I first used it, I was so amazed at the closeness that I couldn&#x27;t stop feeling my face. A little pricey but worth every penny!!! Go buy one today!!!</li>
    <li> The Braun 9595 is expensive, but is worth it.  I&#x27;ve now been using it for about a month to shave my face and head.  It is the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had from an electric (previous experience with Norelco and Remington). With a little work it is virtually as close as a shave with a blade.    A few nits.  The screen can get a little hot when you are using it.  Also, the only way to have the razor&#x27;s display show it as being clean is to use the stand.  If you use it away from the stand, it will show that it is dirty no matter what you do to try and clean it, but it does not affect its performance any.  Otherwise it is 100%.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for 35 years now, the first 10 with blade shavers. My first electric was a Remington which worked but didn&#x27;t shave nearly as close as I liked. I then bought a Norelco triple head (forget the model) and really liked it. Close shave and not too bad to clean up using the little brush supplied with it. That one lasted quite a while but eventually quit. The new Norelco that replaced it was just plain aweful. It didn&#x27;t shave close and the power brick was a pain to use if you had to pack it for travel. Worse yet is that the thing only lasted a couple of years and then wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge. I reluctantly bought the latest model Remington and achieved similar results. I was considering going back to a blade shaver. Fortunately I read about the Pulsonic and bought one. I&#x27;m glad I did!    This thing shaves closer than any electric or blade I have ever used. It&#x27;s as fast or faster than the Norelco, and gets in the tough to reach areas much better. Even the trimmer works far better than any of the others! The cleaning system is phenominal and leaves the razor with a clean lemon scent. I have used the original cartridge for over 3 weeks now and it is still working. I signed up here at Amazon for the subscription service that sends 2 cartridges automatically every 3 months for a LOT less than the local stores. All in all, I would recommend this shaver to anyone looking for the best shave in an electric.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this product for almost a year, and before that I used another Braun with my brother (the alcohol cleaning let me not worry about sharing).    Before coming into the electric razors, I used to use typical straight blades. I had noticed that after a week, maybe a little more, the blade was useless. In addition, my skin is sensitive and I had a tendency to get a lot of ingrown hairs. The way I&#x27;d get the closest shave is to shave against the grain which needless to say, caused more ingrain hairs than I wanted. I became an expert with tweezers as a man to get rid of these, and I really felt there must be a better way.    The first electric I used was about a year and a half ago, and since my brother moved he took it with him and I replaced it with the Pulsonic. And regardless of whether it be the Pulsonic, or the older Braun Syncro (using the same cleaning system as the Pulsonic), I found a world of change in shaving.    My hair is thick and grows back reasonably fast. I shave every other day still, because I can get away with it. But coming from a regular razor, it took me about two weeks to get used to the electric. I forced myself to do it initially -- I was tired of paying for the replacement blades for my Mach3. It was getting pretty expensive. However with the Bed Bath and Beyond 20% coupons, I got the refills for the shaver pretty cheap -- and they lasted quite a while as well.    I have never enjoyed shaving, and even with the electric I don&#x27;t. It takes a little more effort to get the hair that grows on your neck, since they grow in awkward directions (at least for me). I have to make several passes before I get them all. Additionally, I use my hand to make sure that the surface I&#x27;ve used the razor on is smooth, because often the razor can miss some hairs, and you need to go back over it. But despite those minor inconveniences, I am ecstatic about shaving with this over a regular blade. The only way I get a shave as close as the electric, is if I go against the grain with a regular blade. Yes folks -- shaving with the electric gives me as close a shave as a normal razor.    I don&#x27;t suffer any longer from red spots on my face, no more cuts, no more ingrown hairs. I wash my face after I shave with a gentle wash, and moisturize with a light moisturizer. My skin feels great. My family tells me it is soft to the touch. And this coming from a guy who was known to have a brillo pad for a face most of the time.    I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase. Over the Braun Syncro (older model), I&#x27;d say the Pulsonic is better but not amazingly better. It does a better job, gets less hot, and I like that I can plug it in directly as well if I need to. The cartridges are cheap on Amazon (get the 3 packs!), and if you want to make them last a little longer -- clean the blade and shaver under some hot water and tap it out on your sink. It will work for two shaves without a problem. I took it on vacation for a week and just rinsed it -- it worked fine throughout, though the \\&quot;Hygiene\\&quot; indicator dipped low. Came back home, threw it into the base and it went through an exhaustive cleaning process -- and it was smelling fresh and new. I&#x27;m very, very pleased with it.    And for those trying to make the switch from conventional blades and don&#x27;t like them -- do it! This is a product worth buying.</li>
    <li> Braun, a company built on design to solve customer problems, appears to have lost their way with the Pulsonic systems. Until now, I&#x27;ve aways been a fan of their \\&quot;function-dictates-form\\&quot; method, however in this product things went sub-par.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an okay shave. As with any electric shaver, you have to repeat areas, to get that \\&quot;closer than a blade,\\&quot; look. What gets me is, for $200+, I expect something significantly better from my Braun 5775 and it&#x27;s not. I spend no less time when using the 9595, but there are spots on my face (e.g. under the lower lip, below the cheekbones) that the 5775 seems to pick up faster. While \\&quot;Pulsonic Technology\\&quot; (i.e. faster oscillations) works slightly better in most areas, there are a few areas where it significantly underperforms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving cartridge now combines the foil and the cutter, which you can&#x27;t easily clean due to the design. Thus, you need the cleaning system provided by the 9595&#x27;s base. However, you still want to clean the cartridge as the hair, etc. lands in the cleaning fluid. Over time, the pretty blue cleaning fluid becomes a disgusting gray, creating a gooey mass. Is it safe to dump fluid? (I wish Braun had said if it was.) It&#x27;s possible that the faster oscillations required the integration of the cutter and foil, but it&#x27;s also possible Braun wanted to sell an expensive base and the cleaning solution cartridges - now there selling two kinds of \\&quot;blades\\&quot; for their \\&quot;razor.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base looks nice, however, Braun opted to use the same power plug system they have been using for years. It&#x27;s a black cord with the AC to DC transformer connected to the wall-plug. You&#x27;ve just paid $200+ dollars for a pretty white shaving system and then you have this ugly black cord with a huge transformer sticking out of the wall. For $200+, there could have been a transformer in the base of the 9595 system. On the plus side, when I have to get the spots that my 9595 missed with 5775, I can use the same power cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a gadget geek, my office with its computers and electronic gear, looks like a swarm of fireflies when I turn off the lights. Personally, I&#x27;d rather it just be dark. I wish electronics vendors would dump the gratuitous LEDs. I am not going to be using the 9595 in the dark, and I do not need a blue LED (on the shaver) and two green LEDs (on the base). The shaver have an LCD display in the base, why have mutiple informational interfaces?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, why, after paying a ransom, does this shaver not have a replaceable battery? Lithium-ion batteries will wear out after a few years. The marketing copy on the cartridges which claims the system is like new when you replace the cleaning cartridge is overlooking the expensive cutter/foil $36, the cleaning cartridges 2 for $10 and, finally, the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adding insult to injury, after a year without replacing the cartridge, the base would no longer do the brief \\&quot;econo clean.\\&quot; It was as if the system was passively aggressively insisting I replace the cartridge. And, after replacing the cartridge, the system again would do the \\&quot;econo clean.\\&quot; That&#x27;s not a feature, that&#x27;s a nuisance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my 5775 was a quarter the cost of the 9595 and that the Braun brand is a strong one, I expected more. It&#x27;s a good shaver, but the value this shaver gives is not worth the cost. I fear I fell into the hype of \\&quot;Pulsonic Technology.\\&quot;y office with its computers and electronic gear, looks like a swarm of fireflies when I turn off the lights.

    <li> best face shave I ever had.  very clean and smooth.  the cleaning cartridge thing is a joke. ever hear of water and included brush?? lol...anyways face 10/10  neck 6/10..</li>
    <li> The Braun arrived exactly when advised by Amazon.  Even the initial save was excellent but after several uses it was perfect.  It even shaves hairs on my neck without stubble and in my dimple in my chin.  This unit rivals the best of the safte razors for closeness.  Additionally, the cleaning system is so effective that the razor seems brand new every time I use it.  Be sure to follow their short but accuarte shaving instuctions to get the best results.</li>
    <li> My skin very sensitive, I could not shave more than twice in week with normal razor. But with this razor I can shave daily. Initially I was reluctant for 9595, but after having it for one month, I think I can&#x27;t shave without it. Shave is very closer to razor.    Thumbs up.</li>
    <li> My barber classifies me with a \\&quot;monster beard\\&quot; -- very thick and grows quickly.    I&#x27;ve used a Norelco (3 types) for the bast 17 years.  I always thought I had a good shave until I used this.  Its is the closest shave I have every gotten!    With the Norelco, if I skipped a day, the next day I would need a weed wacker (or it felt like a weed wacker).  With this Braun, I could skip a day and the next day wouldn&#x27;t be too bad trying to shave.    Yes, it has a big footprint but I love the cleaning feature (works better than water -- have to use the later when I travel).</li>
    <li> PROS:  Decent shave if your facial hair is &lt;&#x3D; 1 day growth (see cons)  Self-cleaning is decent when the cartridge is relatively new    CONS:  It will rip hairs out of your face if your beard is too long because of gaps on the outer edges of the foil razor  Self-cleaning is bad when cartridge is mid-to-low  Beard trimmer is useless because it springs out backwards  Over-sized cleaning station  Fat power-inverter is at the end of the power cord instead of internalized or in the middle of the power cord.  Expensive!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a lot of shavers and like other reviewers, was looking for a better solution. Bought the expensive 9595 as soon as it was available. It does shave closely/well...which is the primary objective.    However, there are some downsides I&#x27;ve found in the year+ of ownership:  1) Very loud cleaning cycle! I have to do it early evening, because if I do it at night or in the morning, it keeps my wife awake (even with the door closed) and the dog also paces/whines.  2) Expensive Clean/Renew cartridges.  You go through one about every month-6 weeks and at $6+/each, ...  3) Lately, the shaver just shuts off mid-shave after about 5 minutes, despite a full charge, fresh clean/renew cycle and a new cutter/foil head.  Very frustrating.  4) Some of the silver paint near the shaver head has been flaking off.  Wonder if it&#x27;s from the clean/renew formulation.  5) The pop out clipper head (as of 2 days ago) doesn&#x27;t pop back in and refuses to seat back into the shaver body, so I have to hold it closed while I shave.</li>
    <li> I bought this something like a month ago. It was bought sight unseen. I like to keep my razors for more than a couple of years and my old Braun razor was old enough that replacement blades were hard to come by.  The Braun 9595 was a huge step up. I used Norelcos rotary shavers years ago, hated them. Then switched to Remmington razors but they were tough to buy replacement blades for after a year or two.  I was overseas long term and my remington razor died. I picked up a Braun at the suggestion of a friend of mine and it worked so well I&#x27;d never think of switching to another brand. But time wore on as did replacement blades and they became tough to buy so I upped the money and bought a Braun 4000 or 7000 series, I think.  Well it still works but blades are tough to buy.  I bough the latest and greatest and most expensive Braun out there. the 9595. I have trouble shaving my neck, the hairs tend to grow sideways. It&#x27;s misey to shave even with my old Braun. But this new one just shaves the hairs right off my face, no razor burn, nothing! I turn it on and chean it after about 3 shaves. It&#x27;s a bit noisy on intensive clean, however I&#x27;m usually taking a shower so I don&#x27;t care and it really cleans the razor very well.  I did buy a replacement blade and will probably buy a couple more for when I go overseas again. I love the way this razor shaves. I&#x27;d buy another one in a minute. It&#x27;s the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I don&#x27;t think it shaves a lot closer than my old Braun but it doesn&#x27;t give me any razor burn either and that alone is worth it.  If you are thinking about buying one of these it&#x27;s worth it. It just shaves so smoothly and easily and I have to shave every single day, so comfort is very high on my list and the hair doesn&#x27;t grow back as fast for some reason. I usually have stubble by 3pm if I shave at 8am. Not with this razor, so that&#x27;s another plus.  I also bought a pack of cleaning solution. My biggest concern is will I be able to pack the solution in my luggage,since they don&#x27;t sell this in the country I work in.  I never thought I&#x27;d spend this much on a razor but I&#x27;m glad i bought it.  I hope this review helps someone out.</li>
    <li> Nice shaving results- best I ever had in my last 20 years of machine shaving. nice design.  Disadvantages:  Can&#x27;t shave under shower (although can be rinsed in water)  fairly big</li>
    <li> Smooth operation, BUT you need space to plug this razor in for cleanibg---NOT near water in bathroom or near sink</li>
    <li> My husband has used braun for years and likes the fact that you can clean the razor in hygienic fluid after shaving.</li>
    <li> I had a Braun Series 5 for about 5 years and it did a great job, so when it quit working I \\&quot;upgraded\\&quot; to the Series 7. What a mistake. This things does nothing very well and costs much more. It pulls hair, doesn&#x27;t shave close and the postion of the trimmer makes it very difficult to see what you are doing. Avoid this shaver.</li>
    <li> I find that this new pulsonic (whatever that means) razor&#x27;s shave is not any better than my previous version 8595. Oh, the pretty lights and buttons are impressive but the shave isn&#x27;t any better. Am happy that it uses the same refill cartridges.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun for 25 years, and this is the best shaving experience I&#x27;ve ever had. The Vibrating head makes shaving faster and smoother. the slimmer body makes it easier. Whish they would make a non spill cleaner though.</li>
    <li> I bought this for Father&#x27;s Day gift and he loved it so much he recommended I get one for myself.  So I did!  This gives the closest shave I have ever gotten with anything other than a razor.  That statement used to make me prefer a razor until I got this product.  I don&#x27;t get irritated skin anymore, and I actually look forward to shaving everyday now.  Sometimes twice!    Definitely worth the price of admission, and I saved by purchasing from Amazon!</li>
    <li> Braun is in a class by itself.  It has no peers when it comes to shaving performance!  The best shaver I&#x27;ve owned.  Worth every penny.  Use this shaver and you are unlikely to consider any other brand again.  Smooth, clean shave.  Easy to maintain.  Only wish the pop-up trimmer had a straight and not curved cutting edge.</li>
    <li> Update:  After 10 months of ownership I can conclude that the Braun is an exceptionally good \\&quot;dry shaving\\&quot; razor -- with one problem. I have had to replace the blades at about every 2.5 months.  At a cost of about 40 bucks per replacement this is adding up. I have a heavy (but not thick) beard. I also have sensitive skin. So if I do not keep sharp blades, the shaver will cause razor bumps. I am actually considering switching back to Panasonic Dry/Wet Shaver given (1) the cost, (2) I can get three to four months use from their blades.    Well I&#x27;ve now owned this shaver for three months. Previous to owning this shaver I was a completely dedicated Panasonic Dry/Wet Shaver user. While I loved the close shave the Panasonic provided, I was tied to the shower. As a dry shaver, the Braun 7 series has now cut my dependency on wet shaving. My beard is tough but my skin is sensitive - the Braun 7 to date has provided me an exceptionally close shave, but more importantly has not left me with damaged skin. However, even though the manufacturer recommends replacing the blade yearly, I can already sense that I will need to replace the blade after three months of use -- of course I had to just about do the same with the Panasonic. The good: close shave, long lasting charge, easy to clean. The bad: THE PRICE, the flip up trimmer is flimsy and the blade lockout for shaving above the lip is worthless.</li>
    <li> The Braun shaver has performed far better than I had hoped.  I read other reviews and followed some of their advice for better performance.  I have been a blade user all my life but the Braun has changed my mind.</li>
    <li> The new Braun shaver is superior in every aspect!!  Quiet and shaves CLOSE !!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this shaver, especially given the price.  Unfortunately, it is the worst shaver I have ever used.  It simply does not shave close at all.  I should have stuck with my Braun 7680 and just replaced the cutter and foil block.</li>
    <li> I am a new user of the Braun series Pulsonic shaver and am  very satisfied with its performance.  It is much easier to  cover large areas of my face, especially squaring off my   sideburns, and I have tried many brands of electric shavers.  Furthermore, the pressure is minimal with good   cutting action.  Though I am nearly 90 years of age, retired with plenty of time on my hands, I still like the   speed with which I can accomplish this necessary daily task.  Also, the cleaning feature is slick!</li>
    <li> This Braun shaver series seven, matches the claims made for its effectiveness.  Having tried electric shavers in the past, this is the only one that cuts my beard with hairs growing in at a variety of angles in a smooth consistent way.  Always before, I  had to revert to my wet shave razor blade technology, but not this time.  I needed an electric shaver due to broken bones in my right shoulder preventing me from using my right hand, and I am right handed.  I could use this shaver with my left hand while my bones were healing, and much to my surprise I got a very close shave, with a minimum of razor burn.  I plan to make this my permanent shaver and can eliminate the wet shave altogether except in an electrical blackout/emergency lasting several days.</li>
    <li> I have a tough beard and this razor just didn&#x27;t cut it. For the price you would think it could handle all types of beards. I ended up giving it to my nephew.</li>
    <li> I have owned Braun shavers for the last 15 years and the Series 7 is the best shaver yet!  It is a fast shave and it is as close to a blade that you will find.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The pressure facing health and beauty grooming appliances is tough... they have to constantly think of new and better ways to improve their products, EVEN THOUGH they may have already reached a technological ceiling. It&#x27;s because of the competitive nature of the business. They could make subtle improvements in an existing shaver and price it less, but people won&#x27;t buy it because there isn&#x27;t some compelling difference. So, companies keep trying to invent catch phrases and ambiguous functionality, in order to keep prices up (with the illusion that you&#x27;re getting more if you pay more).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How much better can a foil shaver get? Braun reached a major pinnacle with the 7000 series. The Syncro line was the first introducing a head cleaning system, as well as a faster motor with side-to-side vibration. You take a shave with a 7000 series and this new 7 series, and guess what? You won&#x27;t feel a noticeable difference. A few other reviewers have noticed this as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having been a Braun shaver owner for over 15 years, my latest model is the 8595 Activator. It is the equivalent to the 9595, only being from the previous generation. It has almost everything the 9595 has, except for the new casing design and the indicator that tells you when to change the shaving head cassette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happened to have a friend who bought one of these and managed to get him to loan it to me for a week (we traded shavers). Guess what? After a week, we compared notes and discovered that we BOTH found the shaving performance identical between the 8595 Activator and the 790cc Pulsonic (9595).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun lauds its \\&quot;new\\&quot; Pulsonic technology, but in essence it is the same technology they&#x27;ve had since the 7000 series. Quite frankly, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth spending an extra $100 to get the Series 7 model. Instead, I&#x27;d buy a new old stock 8595 or 8995 model for about $100 cheaper. Also, you&#x27;ll save quite a bit of money of the long haul on head replacements. The 9595 (790) uses a \\&quot;cassette\\&quot;, which is essentially the foil and cutter block combined into one unit. You cannot buy them separately. You damage the foil? The whole thing requires replacing. Why did Braun do this? Well... to close a loop hole. On the earlier models, you can replace just the cutter block and keep the your current foil. After all, if the foil is undamaged, it is still doing its job. From a shaving outlet, you can buy the 8000 series cutter block for just $10. The 9595 cassette costs $50! You do the math...lly the foil and cutter block combined into one unit. You cannot buy them separately. You damage the foil? The whole thing requires replacing. Why did Braun do this? Well... to close a loop hole. On the earlier models, you can replace just the cutter block and keep the your current foil. After all, if the foil is undamaged, it is still doing its job.

    <li> My results with the Pulsonic are not baby&#x27;s butt smooth across my bread. However, I&#x27;ve tried everything available except a straight razor, and nothing gets there. There are always areas where rubbing against the grain will detect minute stubble. Even with an aggressive razor (Merkur Slant Bar with Feather blades) and aggressive techniques (blade buffing and j-hooking), that stubble can not be removed without cuts or razor burn. The Pulsonic is a significant improvement over previous Braun shavers. I can get the same results in 2 minutes with the Pulsonic compared to 15 minutes with a wet shave. That wins my vote.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun eletric razors for years now.  This one, by far, is the absolute best that Braun has come out with.  If you haven&#x27;t used an electric razor in a while, you already know that it may take a few weeks for your facial hair to adjust to the electric razor from regular razors.  Use Lectric Shave or something of the like.  My razor began to cut as close as a blade within only 4 uses!  I love this model!  Better quality parts, the LED display on the bottom is great, and the new foil on the head is fantastic!  This is the electric razor to get above all others.</li>
    <li> Awesome device! My boyfriend is so much more clean cut and it makes him look younger, I love it. THANK U!</li>
    <li> I bought the old version of this shaver in December 2007.  The trimmer broke about a couple of months ago so I conracted Braun and was told to ship the shaver with the receipt to a local repair shop because the shaver has a two year warranty.  I could not find the receipt so I called Braun CS again and was told it was still in warranty according to the Serial Number.  I sent the shaver to the repair shop and yesterday I received a brand new system with the series 7, model 790cc shaver for free.  THANK YOU Braun!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been a longtime Norelco customer, but when my SmartTouch XL9160 died 4 months after the 2 year warranty ended, I decided to look into a Braun.  The online reviews on Amazon were very helpful and accurate - this is an excellent shaver.  The ergonomics are great, providing a good feel in the hand - and most importantly it gives a great shave.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now and have been impressed.  I&#x27;m still using the first cleaning tank that came with the shaver, and find I do a \\&quot;full\\&quot; cleaning cycle every 3-4 shaves, rinsing in between as the owner&#x27;s manual recommends, and doing a \\&quot;fast clean\\&quot; on other days.    This device is not cheap - but as another reviewer noted, for something I use every day the investment in quality is worthwhile.  No regrets with this Braun 790CC!</li>
    <li> Most of my previous electric shavers resulted in a shave that made you want another shave.  The 790 is the first one that approaches the closeness of a blade.</li>
    <li> There is no question that this is a good shaver, but be ready for problems down the road. After 13 months (still within 2 year warranty), the motor would stop dead in mid-shave, especially when there are 3-4 bars in the charge indicator. It seemed to increase in speed before quitting. Would re-start immediately at full speed, but then die again within 10-20 seconds.    Also, the slide-up trimmer spring mechanism is jamming - not allowing the door to close flush with the shaver body. You have to hold down the door with your thumb while shaving.    Brought to Braun authorized repair store, they have had it for 3 weeks so far. I called them today, waited on hold for 20 minutes, rep said they are still \\&quot;waiting for parts\\&quot;. I asked if they were coming from Germany? she laughed.....\\&quot;no\\&quot;.     A $225+ shaver only lasts for 13 months before needing repairs, and will probably take ONE MONTH to repair. SHAME ON YOU, BRAUN! I am truly disappointed.    Exact same problems in an 8/16 review.</li>
    <li> I think I made a review on this razor previously, but I cant find it..      Owned 2 years now..     Mine fails in the cleaning cycle..  All the lights go out because the connection was lost and it will not start up again unless you wiggle it and try again. and hope it works)..       As many others, I am disappointed with y $300+ shaver too..   I \\&quot;dropped\\&quot; mine the first month I had it, so maybe trouble I have are related to the drop..  But I blame the $300+ braun design for the drop, because I owned 2 or more panasonics before the braun and never dropped the panasonics (apparently due to the better designed shape.. with all the shaving lube, the panasonic shape makes sense)..      I tried to get braun to help me with the drop (because it was so new), but didnt feel they would do anything for me (so I chose not to pay to ship it to them)..  I will need a new razor soon, and am not considering this overly expensive model (if they would have helped me, I might have been a happy customer)..  For $300+ initial purchase price, they probably could have afforded to completely replace the dropped one (and think about redesigning)..      My status indicator is missing bars, and after about 1  1/2 years it now gets steamed up so I cant read it anyway (possibly related to the initial drop, buy why 1 1/2 years later)..      I cant prove it, but I have a nagging feeling I cant shake, that I have been screwed for $300+ for this shaver.       The shave seemed great at first..  But it did seem the razor foil needed to be snapped down (something after you initially snap it into place)..   before the shave became great..  Unfortunately, the great shave feel didnt last..  I am thinking about getting my third foil replacement..   But I am starting to think I should just buy a cheap panasonic instead (as a better use of my money)..</li>
    <li> I bought the Braun 790cc thinking it was the best on the market. You see, I&#x27;ve used blades for years but hate the amount of time it adds to my morning grooming. So my search for the best electric razor began. After getting the braun home I was in love with its build quality. You would think this was made by Apple it is so sturdy. Unfortunately, after my first shave with my new shiny razor I wasn&#x27;t too impressed. The cheeks and mandible was acceptable but my neck was really not good at all. After a week of shaving I had got better with controlling the razor but shaving took quite a while and I would need to make several passes to get all the stubble, and still there was some left on my neck that I would quickly clean up with my fusion proglide.    Just for kicks I went out and bought the Norelco sensotouch 3d to compare and the results are interesting. First, the sensotouch is much easier to shave with since it conforms to your face as you move it from one part to the next and it takes fewer passes through the same area to get a clean shave thus greatly reducing the amount of time it takes to shave. (Quite honestly, I spend at most 1/2 the time shaving with the sensotouch as with the series 7) It doesn&#x27;t shave as comfortably as the series 7 but I would hardly say it was uncomfortable and I experienced no irritation or redness.    I really wanted to love the series 7, thats why I bought it first; but in the end, for the money, the Norelco sensotouch 3d does win out. The shave was just as close if not closer, easier, quieter, and faster.     Sorry Braun, but you got beat!</li>
    <li> I expected an outstanding shave with this \\&quot;top of the line\\&quot; razor. As it turns out, my 7 year old Remington MS3-4700, which has 4 year old cutting blades, shaves closer than this Braun did out of the box. I will give it points for giving an extremely comfortable shave, but that becomes meaningless when you have a shadow 2 hours after shaving. With all the outstanding reviews this model has gotten, perhaps my beard just doesn&#x27;t go well with this razor - who knows. My Braun foil shaver I had before my Remington (about 10 years ago) gave a much closer shave, for sure.</li>
    <li> It works great on short hair, but I have a beard that i trim every three days and it does not do a clean job on the longer hairs. Besides that it works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with an electric for around eleven months. I&#x27;ve tried the Norelco Arcitec 1090cc and the Panasonic Arc IV ES8243. I couldn&#x27;t get a very close shave with the Arcitec. The Panasonic shaves me as close as the 790cc but if I&#x27;m not careful it can be a bit irritating, and the 790cc shaves me faster. I can honestly say that I&#x27;m completely satisfied with a shaver at last.    I thought an adjustment period was not necessary coming from another foil shaver. I was wrong. After two months the shaves have improved greatly. Maybe it takes three weeks to adapt to a new shaver, but it takes longer to master it.  I do get better shaves than with a manual razor because, in my case, if I shave with a manual razor against the grain I get ingrown hairs and irritation, so I can only shave with the grain. With the 790cc I can get a very close shave that lasts for 12 hours, in 5 minutes.    This shaver is very forgiving and cuts my coarse, thick beard like a hot knife through butter. It&#x27;s a pleasure to use.  It&#x27;s my first shaver with a cleaning module, and although I don&#x27;t mind rinsing a shaver under the faucet, automatic cleaning is very convenient, and you get a shaver that looks and smells like new every time.  I wasn´t very impressed with the design at first, but it has grown on me. When you hold and shave with this shaver it feels very natural. I get closer shaves if I shave every other day, with this, or any other shaver. It&#x27;s not the perfect shaver, but it&#x27;s darn close.</li>
    <li> This is my second electric shave I&#x27;ve purchased, the first one being a Braun Activator 8595 from about 5 or 6 years ago. I had originally purchased that razor, as I am very fair skinned, and as such have very sensitive skin as well. While I loved the smoothness of a Mach3, it destroyed my face. I would break out after shaving, and my face would be extremely irritated. No combo of different shaving gels/aftershave lotions mattered.     So, I researched the Braun Activator 8595, and purchased it. This gave me just as smooth of a shave as the mach3, but with some exceptions. Certain parts of my face, I couldn&#x27;t get as smooth as the rest. That being, the sides of my neck, the chin, my cheeks under the eyes, and right below the ear lobe under the jaw. My shave took 10 minutes,and I didn&#x27;t have any irritation/breakout problems. The mach3 shave would keep me smooth for almost 2 days (I do not have to shave everyday, more like every 2-3), where the Braun would last almost a day.     Recently, I went ahead and gave my Braun to a family member, as he was interested in it, vs. his old rotary norelco, and this gave me a good excuse to upgrade to the latest electric shaver on the market.     After some research, Braun gets my money again. How does this shaver compare to the old champion?    Smoothness wise, I&#x27;d give a slight edge to the 790. But, where the shave truly shines now is the ease of getting that smoothness. The razor does the job in half the time, and there is no where on my face that is a problem anymore. Before if I&#x27;d let my facial hair go, the 8595 would pull hair. This thing just mows right through, with nary a pull.     Braun was able to fix any issues I had with the old version, and make a razor that is better in everyway. It fits in your hand better, its faster, quieter, adjusts to your face better, and one of my biggest issues, is I can force a clean whenever I want. The horrible slider power button is gone, so no more accidentally turning it off while using it. I even like the way the head locks better, as now its a small flick of the thumb, vs. the old slider method.    I only wish they made the LCD display illuminate, but its no big deal. It not like you really need the readout, as there is no reason not to clean it every time, and it&#x27;ll get charged in the process.     This is truly the ultimate in electric razors, as any of the normal complaints you would hear about them, do not exist on this razor.     There is no reason to want to use a mach80 or whatever they&#x27;re up to now, and pay $15+ for 5 blades, that last maybe 2 weeks each, and remove 10 layers of skin. While the price is high on this, remember, that the blades last 18 months, and solution lasts alittle over a month, and is relatively cheap if you buy the bulk packages online. Manual shaves spread the cost out over time with there cheap entry fee and steep replacement blades. With this, its cheaper, but all up front.     You will not be disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> I shave both my face and head so there&#x27;s a lot of area to cover!  I used to use Norelco shavers which were \\&quot;OK\\&quot; but not entirely satisfied.  I heard how Braun shavers give closer shave and took a chance on buying this \\&quot;Cadillac\\&quot; model.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now.  Shaving time cut in half.  I&#x27;m getting closer shaves.  In fact first few shaves I caused some bleeding as I was pressing it down hard like with rotary shavers.  At first I was worried that maybe I made the wrong decision. But after getting used to it, I love it. The self cleaning method is great and easy. I shave with a \\&quot;new\\&quot; electric razor every day.  You can save on the solution if you take the shaving head off and gently tapping the bottom to remove the hair, and rinsing it in hot water, and dry it with a hair dryer ( I finally have some use for my old hair dryer since I&#x27;m a \\&quot;smooth head\\&quot; now! ).  It always cleans in \\&quot;eco\\&quot; mode if you do that.  For people who make their own solution because of the expense of the cartilages, I say spending $7 a month is a bargain!  I was spending more just to buy a month worth of \\&quot;lectric shave\\&quot; when I used to use a rotary razor.  If you can afford this razor, you can afford $7 a month on a replacement cartilage. I bought a dozen on Amazon for $67.94.  Also I don&#x27;t know why, but this razor shaves better if you don&#x27;t wash your face before you use it.  I made a mistake the first time I used it, I took a shower and applied \\&quot;lectric shave\\&quot; like I would with a rotary, and my face was bloody mess!  Natural oil on your skin makes it for a better shave on this exellent shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great shaver.  I&#x27;m a Braun user for life.</li>
    <li> I have had a Braun electric razor for several years. After buying new blades but still not getting the shave I wanted, I decided the buy a new razor with the cleaning system. I read many reviews and looked at many shavers and although expensive, I believed the Braun Series 7-790cc Pulsonic Shaver was the one for me. I use it almost every day and have been very pleased with so far. It doesn&#x27;t make your face soar like some shavers and gives the closest shave one can get, aside from shaving soap and a multi-bladed razor. Splash on some Williams Lectric Shave lotion and get the closest shave I believe any electric shaver can give you!</li>
    <li> Buy this shaver if you&#x27;re tired of electric shavers not giving you that close of a trim.  I picked this up 14 months ago on a Gold Box deal.  While I thought $180 was a bit pricey, I decided to try it out.  It has turned out to be an excellent choice.  Even at the $220 price tag, I&#x27;d suggest it.  This shaver gives the best, most reliable shave that I&#x27;ve had from any electric razor.  Two of us in the house (father and son) use this shaver.  It is just now beginning to need maintenance (the shave it not quite as good and quick as it used to be).  I&#x27;ll be picking up the Cassette Replacement Pack soon to bring it back to new.  Even after 14 months, its still better than any shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> I vacillated for a long time because of the expense.  But, I got so tired of my Norelco, always having to use a blade after using the shaver, and then Amazon offered a sales price... still expensive.  But, the results are terrific!  The best electric shaver ever!  I probably can get a better shave with cream and a blade, but why bother.  This Braun really provides a great shave... and it always feels fresh and new in the morning.</li>
    <li> Like many others, I have tried several electric razors over the years. The Series 7 is by far the best I&#x27;ve used. It gets a close shave even in trouble areas around my neck. I&#x27;ve had several of the Norelco rotary blade types, a Panasonic and an earlier Braun. The Series 7 is the first I&#x27;ve been totally satisfied with. It almost gives &#x27;blade&#x27; close. The razor is comfortable to hold, only slightly noisy, and gives a quick shave. I have been using the razor for 3 months now.    The pop up trimmer is almost useless but I have other trimmers that I use so I was not counting on it anyway. The cleaning system is easy to use and if the monthly cost of replacement cartridges bothers you, there are many home made solutions in various web pages to help get around that.     Note: I bought this at Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond with their 20% off coupon, which coupled with a razor promotion they offered, cut my price to under the Amazon price. They also have a very generous return policy. I returned a Norelco after using it over a year with no questions asked.</li>
    <li> The shaver is very nice and works well.  Hadn&#x27;t used an electric razor in 30 years or so but after getting used to this one, it seems to give a close shave.  The cost was up there but seems to be worth it so far.  I&#x27;ve had it for about a month or so. I have been off work for awhile and have only been shaving 2X per week and it doesn&#x27;t seem to mind the heavy growth and it doesn&#x27;t pull the whiskers either.  The cleaning mode is nice but it is a little loud when going through the cleaning cycle.</li>
    <li> Pros:  A great electric shaver that does almost everything it claims.    Cons:  Pricey, Trimmer leaves something to be desired.    I bought this shaver as a Xmas gift for myself.  I looked long and hard at all the reviews before I decided to spend this kind of money for a shaver.  The thing that interested me most was the cleaning system.  I have used many shavers that were just a royal pain to clean.  Put this one back in the stand and presto, it&#x27;s clean!    I have been using it for just over a month and I love it.  Not only is it easy to clean but it really does shave like a blade.  Well almost but you won&#x27;t cut yourself trying.  One trouble spot I have is long hairs that used to appear from nowhere. What a pain it was to get rid of them.  Well this shaver says it will take them off and sure enough, it does!      The long hair trimmer is why I did not give this shaver a five star rating. (Not what I was speaking about above) I have gotten used to having one on my other shavers and use it to trim sideburns and ear hair.  The trimmer on this shaver is positioned so that when you pop it open it is below the shaver head.  This makes it very hard to see what you are doing, and it feels awkward using it. It works fine, it&#x27;s just hard.      I travel a lot and was concerned about the liquid making a mess.  Don&#x27;t throw away the cap for the cleaning fluid.  Just take the container out of the base and seal it up.  No problem.  For short trips I don&#x27;t even take the base.  The power cord is all you need and just rinse the shaver per the instructions.    I would not hesitate to recommend this shaver to anyone.</li>
    <li> Quiet - nice design. Like very well overall. I still have to go over some places more than once but compared to previous razors - it seems to work about the best.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000Q6SU3C Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic  Shaver]]    Very good product, excellent price, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> this is the most i have ever spent for a shaver and it was worth the money the self cleaning function is better than i thought it would be i  would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m deployed in Afghanistan right now, and I brought my Braun 5 series with me. It worked for about 2 weeks after I got here and then started to die on me in the middle of shaving. I could squeeze it and have it pick back up in speed, but then it would die again. So I ended up wrapping rubber bands around it to keep it going. That too eventually stopped working after 2 weeks. So I decided, that since I enjoyed my last Braun I should look into a new one. When I saw this one, I remembered commercials I saw on TV when I was back home and thought, Yeah that&#x27;s the one I want. Then I saw the price tag. It was steep. I&#x27;m pretty low on the pay scale and $300 is a lot of money. So, I was like ok, that&#x27;s too much and I went to using the pack of disposable razors I had with me. You always have to be prepared in the military. After 2 days of absolute misery with these disposables, I caved in. I dropped the 300 dollars and ordered it. Then it said it would arrive between the middle of February and March! I was irritated but I need a good razor, so I went ahead and ordered it. So 4 days later I get a package and low and behold it was the razor. I still had stubble from earlier in the morning when I had attempted to shave. So when I got off shift, the first thing I did was to open the box and get the razor charged. I read a little in the manual while I waited for it to clean and charge, and then it was time! When I finally had the opportunity to use it, it was like a stubble eraser! It didn&#x27;t even feel like I was shaving! No rough anything rubbing across my skin, no pulling, not even the sensation of cutting. NOTHING! It was like my hair was magically disappearing with the pass of the magic wand called the 7 series! I even popped up the trimmer to clean up my side burns and hair line around my ears. It cut off the hair without me even noticing. I didn&#x27;t even realize I had gotten any hair until I saw the clump on the ground. And even with the trimmer up, it was quieter than my last Braun was when just shaving. This thing is extremely quiet for an electric razor and so nice that I was actually spending more time than necessary to shave in the morning. I found myself just rubbing the thing across my face because I couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth it was. I was actually having fun shaving. Something I learned to dread in the military. Any chance I could get away without doing it, I would! After using this product I might just pretend like I have to shave just so I can take it out of its nice hard plastic case that came with it. Thank you Braun for making such an incredible product.Braun was when just shaving.

    <li> My Braun 7526 model, after 8 years, is starting to die down on me. So I came here to read reviews on other models, and was pretty hyped up about all the positive reviews of the pulsonic model. I ordered it, looked great and took it for a test drive.  Well, I was very disappointed. It really didn&#x27;t provide the closeness that everyone claimed it does.  It left quite a lot of stubble and long hairs on my face.  I thought, well, maybe I need an adjustment period, but day after day the same thing.  Finally, I decided to use my old braun after shaving with the pulsonic and I couldn&#x27;t believe how much hair my older model started clearing off my face. I could hear the blades cutting all the hair the newer model had left behind!  Well, needless to say, I have returned the product back to Braun for a refund.  I am still using my older model and have decided to just order the same one again. Very big disappointment on what was supposed to be this great new technology.</li>
    <li> This product rocks the hair right off my face! I&#x27;ve also tried it on my head and it works almost as good. Great product Braun!! The only downfall I might see (and its only minor) is the cleaning solution. You can shave with it several times before you need to clean.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boy-friend for Christmas (2009).  He had been using razors all his life and they have caused skin irritations.  He really likes this shaver.  Of course it does not shave as closely as the razors but it creates a smooth surface that does not scratch my facial skin.  Have not dealt with cleaning yet I heard it can be expensive and a hassle so I am cautious and gave a 4-star.</li>
    <li> I waited about 2 years longer than I wanted to purchase a new electric razor because I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the products available. When I saw this electric razor, I decided it was time to upgrade. I have had it for a few months now and I have been generally disappointed. It&#x27;s not that this isn&#x27;t a great product, I was just expecting more from it. My old electric razor was the Braun 7526 and it was pretty awesome. I used it regularly for about 5 years before upgrading to the 790cc. The things that bother me most about the 790cc are its sideburn trimmer and similarity in shave to the 7526. The sideburn trimmer is much weaker than the 7526 and considering that the upgrade cost a few hundred dollars, I expected the shaving experience to be better, not comparable.     If you&#x27;re getting into electric razors for the first time, then this is definitely a great product. However, if you are satisfied with the one you have and are just looking for an upgrade, then I would holdout a little longer. I find myself using the 7526 over the 790cc most days and that&#x27;s annoying.</li>
    <li> Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been a faithful user of Norelco shavers ever since I started shaving in my teen years and they worked really well for me.  As I am now in my mid 40&#x27;s I have more than my fair share of grey whiskers.  These whiskers are much thicker than the dark brown whiskers they replaced.  My Norelco was not able to cut these whiskers any longer.  I called Phillips Norelco and asked them if they made a shaver that would handle my problem and after some discussion it was clear that I was going to have to find a new shaver.  After months of research and reading literally 100&#x27;s of user reviews from several different sources, I decided to try the Braun Series 7.  I am very impressed with this shaver.  Not only does it tackle my grey beard with ease, it gives me the closest shave I have ever had.  The Charging / Cleaning base is very nice but is a bit bulky.  It will not fit on small vanity&#x27;s therfore I have mine sitting in my home office next to my printer.  It has a nice travel case with a brush in the end for cleaning the shaver while away from home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word for perspective buyers.  Read and follow the directions carefully.  Shave before washing your face or showering.  Shave against the direction that the whiskers are laying.  Return the shaver to it&#x27;s Charging/Cleaning cradle after use and clean the shaver after every use to achieve the best results.  It will take 2 - 3 weeks for your face to get used to this new shaver so there might be a slight discomfort after shaving at first.  Using an aftershave lotion or balm is highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a last note.  My wife Loves to feel my freshly shaved face now. She say&#x27;s that my skin is so smooth since I started using this shaver.</li>
    <li> I replaced my 9 year old Braun shaver with this new one as I droped the cleaning station from my older model and broke it.  I still use the old shaver for a spare and traveling...still going strong!  This model shaves very close and cleans &amp; charges itself automatically.  This product is high quality and made to last.  I was so impressed with my last Braun shaver I didn&#x27;t consider another brand this time.  This model is excellent!</li>
    <li> First I been buying Braun Electric Shavers for over 10 years and never had a problem till now. When I received the 790CC shaver (Braun&#x27;s best and most expensive) back in March 2009, I was very pleased with it. But now 6 months later I found while shaving (plug or Cordless)IT SHUTS OFF DURING THE SHAVE!!! At first I though it needed cleaning but it did it after being cleaned. Right now I&#x27;m using a manual blades to shave because the shaver shuts off constantly. Not sure if this is a bug in there system or Amazon got a bad a batch of shavers from Braun.    Jay G</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Braun Syncro for 6+ years and have really enjoyed the shaver and the self-cleaning.  I recently upgraded to the Series 7 790cc and couldn&#x27;t be happier. The shave is closer, quieter and quicker than the Syncro.  Besides a cheaper price tag, I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more.  I actually found a pretty good deal at Bedbathbeyond. It was on sale for $250 and I had a 20% off coupon for a total price of $200.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.      Several Pulsonic owners have mentioned the short life of the cleaning solution and/or having to manually oil the razor because they were hand washing the razor in water every day.  Whats up with that?  Why handwash a shaver that cleans itself?  You just bought an expesive razor, but can&#x27;t afford 6 bucks a month for cleaning solution? I have a tip for both scenarios.  There is no need to clean these shavers every day. I only charge and clean mine once a week and it functions perfectly.  I did the same with my Syncro.  I get two months out of my cleaning solution.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a shave as smooth as possible, razor blades are the answer. However, if you want to use an electric shaver that is the next best thing, the Braun Series 7 is it. Over the years I tried different electric products that came up well short. They did not shave as close as I thought and some irritated my face so bad that it was impossible to continue using them. From the first day, the Braun was gentle to my skin yet gave me that close shave I was accoustmed to. And the clean &amp; renew system makes the shaver like new every day.</li>
    <li> The best shave you will ever have from a non blade  razor.  I have had and used a Braun shaver for many years and it finally died so I purchased the Pulsonic shaver even though I thought it was over priced. The shaver is so good I think it was a good purchase even at the price I paid.</li>
    <li> I have used Braun shavers for years, and figured I&#x27;d buy the top of the line in hopes of better performance.  Here&#x27;s what I found.    BUILD  This is the nicest Braun I have used in terms of build.  It feels solid and well made.  The on/off button is better than the slide up/down switch on my old Braun 8995.    SHAVE  I have been using it for several weeks, and I can safely say it shaves no better (nor worse) than my Braun 8995 (which, if you do some digging, can be found for $140).  No complaints, I just was hoping for some noticeable difference in performance.  If you are used to using an electric razor, you will find this to be a solid performer.  The shave is as close as you are going to get with an electric. (A word of advice for those who haven&#x27;t shave with an electric...if you switch, despite the wet shave option, it is best to shave when your face is completely dry - like 30 minutes after a shower.  The closeness of the shave increases dramatically over shaving before showering or immediately after).    DISPLAY  I think the display is quite a bit worse than the older models.  There are two semi-circle bar meters on the bottom of the shaver - one for battery, and one for hygiene (or how badly it needs a cleaning).  They are not bright or easy to read.  This is pretty primitive compared to the earlier model which had a small display which showed you remaining shaving time, and level of cleaning required.  The old one also would tell you when it was time to change the foil and blade (every 18 months).  This is a step back that I don&#x27;t understand.    SUMMARY  This is a good razor, but I am not sure I would bother spending all the extra $$$ on the top model.  The older models get the job done, and I presume, the lower cost newer models do as well.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this shaver to replace my Braun 8995.  No complaints on the 8995 other than the hairs that would always fall out while shaving.  This unit is a definite improvement over that model.  It does shave a bit closer than that the 8995.  My only issue at this point, it the \\&quot;Hygiene\\&quot; indicator seems a bit too sensitive and will be at empty after about 2-3 shave.   I still get a little bit of droppings out of it but nothing like the 8995.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through the gamut of electric razors - Braun, Panasonic, Norelco, etc. I have had several Braun razors through the years, and decided to give this one a go. It worked great for the first few months. Then, the issues began. In a nutshell, the cleaning mechanism did not work. The razor wouldn&#x27;t seat correctly, and the cleaning either wouldn&#x27;t start or it stopped mid-cycle. I called Braun customer service, and got a major run around. I mailed it in to an authorized repair shop to determine the issues and get them fixed. They mailed it back, stating it was repaired and that there were issues with the connectors. It worked fine for about 2 weeks, and the same issues happened over and over again. Essentially, razor doesn&#x27;t register when inserted into the cleaning chamber. It won&#x27;t run a complete cleaning cycle. I searched around to buy a replacement charging/cleaning stand - and they&#x27;re sold out or back-ordered everywhere. Which leads me to believe this is a known issue with this razor, and everyone is trying to replace the charging stands. Sad to say, I had this razor too long for a return to Amazon, and of course, the cleaning cartridges can&#x27;t be returned at any point. For its price point, I expected so much more. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one. I&#x27;m sticking with Panasonic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been extremely happy w/ my prior Braun shavers so decided to spend a bit more to get a new, top of the line (at the time) model.  Unfortunately this shaver is a big step back from my prior models in a number of ways.  A quick summary of my experiences:&lt;br /&gt;Good:&lt;br /&gt;- shaves a bit quicker than my prior model&lt;br /&gt;- shave might be a bit closer&lt;br /&gt;- battery life is reasonable&lt;br /&gt;Bad:&lt;br /&gt;- pop-up clipper broke w/in the first month of use&lt;br /&gt;- didn&#x27;t have this problem initially, but shaver will lose contact w/ charging base now during charge/clean cycle.  This happens consistently and takes me three or more tries to get it to clean (if I&#x27;m lucky)&lt;br /&gt;- PULLS HAIRS.  If I go more than a day w/ this razor (even 1.5 days), the unit yanks some hairs instead of shaving, which is quite painful. Originally I thought it was though the foil, but I think it&#x27;s actually that hairs get caught between the side of the foil and the shaver body.  Either way, it hurts.  My prior shaver I could go twice as long between shaves and never had this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this purchase was a bust.  Not sure I&#x27;ll go to another brand, but I will definitely be looking at alternatives next time around.  I gave it 2 stars because although it does a decent job shaving on most days, the issues are significant and unacceptable at this price point.</li>
    <li> The unit I received was faulty (would not clean), however Amazon would not accept returns of the product (even for exchange).  Presumably because of the container of cleaning fluid that is shipped with it.  Since it is a complex piece of machinery, I cannot recommend buying it with Amazon.</li>
    <li> Received the razor as advertised. I purchased my first Braun about 6 years ago and other than changing foils, it still works pretty good. I decided to get this one and use the other for travel. My new Braun works very well and cuts very close. Its not shaving with a blade, but the next best thing without the nicks and cuts.</li>
    <li> I like foil shavers over rotary ones.  And I think Braun makes the best foil shavers out there.  My wife gave me a Series 7 when my older Braun shaver started to fall apart after 10+ years of service (the power switch broke off).  You can go crazy sifting through all the buzzwords used to describe shavers.  But it boils down to the question, \\&quot;Will this shaver offer me a close and comfortable shave?\\&quot;  This is a nice shaver that cuts closer than any shaver I&#x27;ve used before.  It even gets that stubborn neck hair which I&#x27;ve always had to use a standard razor in the past to clean up.    The razor has a different sensation when it is going over your skin than other ones.  The best I can use to describe it is a \\&quot;cool burn.\\&quot;  It&#x27;s not painful or discomforting, just different.  Perhaps that is the pulse technology at work.    One thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that the traveling case does not have any room for the charger.  The case is a hard, plastic shell that is the exact form of the shaver.  With other cases, I knew to remember the charger because the case left a little pocket or section for it.  I just know that one day I&#x27;m going to forget the charger when I leave for a trip.    Before having one, I always thought that the cleaning base was a little gimmicky and just a way for the company to make a little more money by selling refill packs.  But I have to admit that it is nice having a fresh, clean razor.  I&#x27;ve found that I can clean the razor every other day without noticing much difference in performance and extend the life of the cleaning pack.  I&#x27;ve had my razor for about two months and I&#x27;m just now getting to the the point where I need to replace the cleaning pack. You will have to find room in your bathroom for the base station.  It is yet another gadget that people used to be able to just throw in a drawer that now needs its own \\&quot;parking spot.\\&quot;  Keep that in mind if you are short on bathroom counter space.</li>
    <li> I started using this shaver on January 1, 2009.  It&#x27;s my fourth or fifth generation Braun shaver.  I&#x27;ve been using them for many years.  This one is the best so far.  I get the smoothest shave with the least skin irritation of any electric I&#x27;ve tried.  As the manual suggests, you do get a closer shave if you shave before showering.  I love the self cleaning feature, but I only use it once a week so the cartridge will last longer.  The rest of the time I just open the screen and empty the clippings out manually.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Is this shaver everything it is cracked up to be?  No, It&#x27;s not perfect.  But it is the best electric shaver I have used.  I have been a Norelco user for many years.  Last year, I purchased a Philips Norelco Arcitec and was very disappointed.  Very expensive and the shave was terrible.  It took longer to shave and it still didn&#x27;t get those pesky neck hairs.  In fact, my older Norelco did a better job.  Now for the Braun, it does shave very close.  In fact, it does the chin area very well and shaves as close as a blade.  It still requires several passes on the neck.  You have to get used to this as you can nick you skin if you use too much pressure.  The cleaning system works very well and is very convenient.  I found my solution lasts well over a month.  It still takes over 5 minutes to shave and the neck takes a great deal of patience time and skin stretching.  If you use an electric shaver now, you will like this one and find it to be the closest thing to shaving with a blade.  If you plan to purchase this, I suggest buying on Amazon.com.  My first one broke and their return policy is outstanding and the best on the internet.  Within 48 hours I had a new one.</li>
    <li> I went to an electric after 30 years of blade shaving.  Years ago I tried a Norelco but realized I would never get a shave as close as blades.  This Braun Series 7- 790cc though does a very acceptable job.  It is not blade shaving nor is it supposed to be.   It does seem to get better with each shave.  I am very satisfied.  It is a time saver and it sure is nice not dealing with cuts, nicks, and expensive blades. I used to skip shaving on weekends just to give my face a break, but it is so quick and easy to use this Braun that I don&#x27;t mind shaving 7 days a week.  Your face does need to get used to it though.  You can irritate your face if you press too hard and go over an area too many times, so I suppose there is a learning curve and some conditioning required.  But all-in-all I would recommend this shaver to anyone considering electric shavers.  The cleaning system is a great idea, works well and overall the cartridges are not that expensive.  My only real complaint was mentioned in an earlier review that only a few days after I purchsed this product, Amazon went and lowered the price. A bit underhanded if you ask me.</li>
    <li> Gives a very close shave, and does not irritate my skin. Most razors I have used before makes my neck break out. One thing to note, if you use the full cleaning service daily, it will be very expensive over the course of the year. I think the razor works fine when you wash it with water for 2 days, and use the cleaning tray on the third day. Then your cartridges will last 3 months instead of 1 month. overall, the best razor I have ever used, hands down.</li>
    <li> This is the fourth Braun Shaver I have owned...series 3...5...6...and now series 7.By far the best yet. Very smooth....very close...dosen&#x27;t get hot....no irritation...and no hair in the sink. I have been shaving with it every day now for five months.and still per forms like new. If you are an electric guy....BUY IT!</li>
    <li> Purchased the  Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver from Amazon who I highly recommend. I have been shaving with Braun shavers for 40 years and this is a awesome shaver, my reason for giving it four stars instead of five is the lack of information that it displays. Before this shaver I owned the 360 and that shaver gives a lot more information such as Foil replacement no,number of shaves the shaver has shaved over it&#x27;s lifetime, etc, I think Braun could upgrade this feature which I would say would make this shaver more attractive.</li>
    <li> Tried this after many years with Norelco. It pulled and grabbed my chin hairs and it was painful. I called Braun, very nice folks. They sent me a new head. Same problem. I finally chucked it. I tried and tried but couldn&#x27;t get past the hair grabbing. Back to Norelco and everything is much better....</li>
    <li> My Norelco rotary never did a very good job on my neck without working it hard and causing irritation. I just switched to the Braun and it does a much better job overall with no irritation. I have a heavy beard so it&#x27;s a good test. The positives- a good, close shave without irritation and gets those pesky neck hairs pretty well. The shaver can be used with the cord and also quick charges if needed. The negatives- Expensive, noisier than the Norelco, you have to buy cleaning cartridges once a month and the charger/cleaner is cheaply constructed. Also be careful with the cleaning cartridges as they spill easily when you pry the cover off. All in all a premium shaving system at a premium price.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver. I love the shelf cleaning. It does a great job. But... It&#x27;s to expensive.</li>
    <li> This shaver was my first chance on an electric, as I&#x27;ve been using a manual razor for my whole life up until now. I was a bit hesitant, but after using the Braun for a month I can confidently say that it is a terrific electric shaver. It shaves so close that the difference between the Braun and a manual razor is negligible at most. Cleaning system works great too, a little loud but doesn&#x27;t last for too long. Overall, even though the Series 7 is a bit pricey, I have found it to be worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome, after my first shave I threw my rotory in the garbage (Norelco Arcitec) as it never shaved right.    My first shave was as smooth as a razor. Cleaning seems great (no mess!!!). Be advised there is a cleaning pack that you must buy for the cleaning (Comes with one however). Each pack lasts around 30 days. A 12 pack on Amazon is around $56.</li>
    <li> I had been using a Norelco shaver and Gillette mix razor for decades.  The Gillette gave closer shaves when needed.  Now that I bought the Braun Series 7-790cc, it will be the only shaver that I will use because it is as close as a shave as the Gillette, but saves a lot of time.  I also love the cleaning base as it does a great job and the lemony aroma is nice to start out with.  I will definitly recommend this shaver and I know that when I will need another shaver in the future, it will be this one.</li>
    <li> I liked my old Norelco better!  This new Braun takes me 3-4x as long to shave my face.  Many hairs simply do not get touched and I have to make 5-6 passes...very frustrating.  For being as expensive as it is, this shaver should cut close and do it reasonably fast.  Every shave is an act of frustration.</li>
    <li> I have used Braun shavers for many years and have seen improvements with each new shaver. I thought my last one (8995)was great and better than the several others that come before it. However, my new Pulsonic is much improved. It shave closer, is quieter and is very easier to use. I would reccomend it to friends and would buy another one in a minute.It&#x27;s definately 5 stars. I do find the new cleaning unit has taken some time to get used to the changes from the previous one. It seems to require a cartirdge change much more often. After a week or so, it just goes off. When this happens I just unplug it and then plug it in again and it works fine.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used. Expensive, but worth every penny. I had given up on electrics, using every razor made, and was still not satisfied. An injury I sustained made it temporarily impossible to use a manual razor so I tried the Braun. Now that I&#x27;m over the injury, I&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
    <li> My husband raves about this Braun Pulsonic Shaver!  Gives a smooth, close shave without ever burning or irritation.</li>
    <li> Great product. Smoothest shave ever from an electric razor. I have sensitive skin and this bugs me the least.</li>
    <li> Got this about three weeks ago and it works great. I had a Braun shaver similar to this one before this but it was a few years old. This one definitely gets the job done better.    I had to take a star off, however, because every time I shave three or four times in the process I will get a sharp pain where I am shaving like someone hit me in the face with a rubber band. It doesn&#x27;t cause any nicks or irritation or anything like that, so I&#x27;m not sure why it feels that way. Kind of like the shaver is ripping the hair out instead of cutting it.    Overall though, HIGHLY recommended if you want an electric shaver. My face is smoother than ever in a shorter amount of time.</li>
    <li> I am 35, and have been using a Philips (Norelco) Speed XL for the last 5 or 6 years on a daily basis. This shaver gave me a decent shave. When three months ago the battery died on my Philips, I decided to buy the latest from Philips, the Arcitec. Little did I know that was one of the biggest mistakes in my shaving life. It is very, very cool, with a beautiful finish, cleaning station, etc. BUT, it left big unshaved patches on my neck. For a month I struggled with this shaver with no better results. I had to finish my neck using a manual blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I decided to research for another electric razor. And I found out that the Braun Series 7 is one of the best reviewed electric razors. I am currently in Europe, and here I found that the latest Braun Series 7 is the 795, a slightly better model than the 790. So I bought it. It has three settings, intensive, normal and sensitive. It gives the CLOSEST shave an electric razor is going to give you. My face is almost baby smooth now. My neck is not so close as my face, but far closer than with the Arcitec, and no hairy patches. I never could have thought an electric razor could be so close, but it really is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning station is, simply, perfect. It cleans, lubricates the razor and it leaves an excellent lemony scent. I use the fast clean feature on a daily basis (it takes just 25 seconds), and a more intensive cleaning once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you are looking for a close daily shave, with absolute no irritation (and I know about irritation, with a fairly sensitive skin) I honestly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PD: Forgive me if I have made any mistakes when writing in English. (My native language is Spanish)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve stepped to electric razors a couple years ago.  Previously I used both the leading Gillette Fusion and Shick Quattro razors.  I stepped to electric razors as an attempt to reduce cutting irritation and provide a quicker, less fuss shave.    My first step was to a Braun Series 1 as a trial.  It had good reviews as a budget razor.  Initial impressions were mediocre.  The big issue was I don&#x27;t shave daily all the time, and once the hairs get long, foil razors stop being efficient.  Shave time goes way up.  I basically said screw it and went towards the high end.  I wanted to see if the best available could give me what I wanted.    I first started with Norelco&#x27;s SmartTouch XL razor because the rotary type razors function better with longer hairs.  I got it just before the Arcitec came out and represented the best Norelco product available at the time.  I was also considering the Braun Pulsonic as an option, but the price difference wasn&#x27;t worth it at the time.    The SmartTouch is an excellent razor.  The 3 layer cutting and circular design works outstanding for getting most of the hairs quickly and easily.  The rotary type razors are quiet and fast working on even very long hairs.  The relatively slow rpm does limit overall cutting rate on really long and thick hair.  Pull is minimum, but you can tell there&#x27;s a little wait time if you try and cut fast.  The only real downside of this type of razor is that it doesn&#x27;t cut as close to the skin as a foil type razor.  It ends up taking a significant amount of pressure against the skin to get the razor to cut really close like a razor.  To do so, you will need some sort of lubricant, but soap and water does work fine.  There&#x27;s just a bit of friction from the shaver.  Really close shaves can rash the skin a little bit if you try too hard.    I stepped to the Braun Pulsonic as a trial to see if I could do better than the Norelco product.  I found one for a good price eventually and grabbed it.  The big thing I liked about the Pulsonic that made it different from other foil razors was that it had the center long hair cutter.  This was a big deal because long hairs is the greatest enemy of foil type cutters.  It&#x27;s great to see Braun also adding this to lower level razors now because it works great.  There are several things I like about the Braun razor over the Norelco.  First, it cuts faster.  You can not shave for a week and even though it&#x27;s a foil shaver, it will cut off a lot of it very quickly due to that center long hair cutter.  Once a lot of the long hairs are cut down, the foil cutters work the rest down quickly.  Shave speed gains might be around 20%.  Plus the shave gets closer than the Norelco with less pressure.  It&#x27;s much easier to get a razor close shave with the Pulsonic.  The razor also glides over the skin quite easily.  Even if you put a bit of pressure against the skin, the Braun glides over the skin well.  The braun doesn&#x27;t really rash the skin much even with pressed moderately to the skin.  The Braun can chop a little bit at the skin though (not painful/deep, but little one layer cuts here and there).      Now there are some traits I do not like.  The Braun razor is significantly louder, just a lot more noisy.  Rotary razors are just really quiet.  Foil razors have the loud buzz you common think of and the Pulsonic is no exception.  The foil type razor is also sensitive to cutting direction.  With the areas where the hairs like to lay down, the Braun has trouble grabbing and cutting these hairs.  You have to make sure you go against the lay and you typically have to brush your hand against the lay to raise them up before you go over them with the razor.  Wipe across the stubborn hairs with a hand, and zip over them with the razor.  This works slick and pretty easily counters the troublesome hairs.  Since rotary razors like the Norelco cut in all directions and that you typically use them in a circular manner, they tend to get those stubborn hairs a little easier.    Some notes on long term wear.  I used each for a little over a year.  The Norelco experienced little to no wear.  I never replaced the cutters and I got the unit used.  It worked as good as new the day I stopped using it.  The unit was sold to me at a pretty cheap price due to the cleaning base being broken.  It wasn&#x27;t actually broken, just stuck and was oddly jammed.  I quickly popped it free, and it worked great.  The Norelco showed no wear after a year of use and looks and functions just like new.  A roommate of mine is now using it and enjoys it.    I got the Braun shaver used as well, used for a few months I believe.  I got some fresh cleaner for the base but never touched the cutter during my use.  The Braun has functioned well for the year, but a couple little problems have popped up.  First, there is some flaking of the painted surface near the cutter.  I assumed the cleaning solution does slightly break down the paint over time.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to wear at all by handling though, so the paint is durable to the hand.  It just seems to be the cleaning solution doing it.  Second, the charging base has two spring loaded tabs that the charging pins on the razor sit against to charge.  These tabs are a painted plastic, and the paint is conductive enough to transfer electricity.  Well, one of the tabs now has the paint flaking off, so now the razor has trouble charging or cleaning.  This needs to be fixed using some sort of conductive paint or something.  The razor can be plugged in directly to the cord, but it sort of makes the cleaning base useless.  The cleaning base does function and last well otherwise.  The cleaning solution even lasts quite a long time as you don&#x27;t use it all the time.  Clean it once a week or two and wash after normal use, the solution easily lasts a year which was surprising.  I am finally replacing the cutter head on the braunt.  The 18 month suggestion seems decently accurate for wear.  It starts to cut a little slower (not much) and starts to pull just a little bit.  Connection points within the razor are plastic, so I assume there is some wear over time too that may limit vibration intensity.  There really isn&#x27;t visual wear, so design and materials seem proper.  Other than some minor wear issues, the razor has held up well.    So, is the Braun Pulsonic the best razor I&#x27;ve used?  Yes.  I can say that I do consider it a better razor.  It shaves faster and shaves closer than the Norelco product.  Its use however is a little more tricky.  It takes a little more skill and understanding to shave your face quickly and to get all the stubborn hairs.  The Norelco is a better no fuss razor.  You just go around your face until everything&#x27;s cut.  It&#x27;s just as quick or as close without significant skin pressure (requiring some lubrication to do).    What about hand razors again?  Well, going back, I do find both the Fusion and Quattro both harsher on the skin.  The Fusion is great about getting a really close shave and go through long, thick hair without clogging, but it pulls a lot.  The cut is just very sharp.  The Quattro is much smoother in its cutting, and I tended to prefer it.  It does clog easily though when going through a lot of hair and deep hair.  Both wear very slowly.  The titanium bladed Quattro takes forever to wear down.  I still use a hand razor for some minor trimming here and there, but have pretty much exclusively used electric razors for the last couple years.  Time wise, hand razors can be quicker in some cases, but both approaches do take a similar amount of time.  Electric can be faster if you don&#x27;t care about the random stubborn hairs or don&#x27;t care about a razor close shave.  If you use an electric maybe twice a day, you could zip through the process in a minute.  If you don&#x27;t shave for several days, and want a no hair, razor close shave, it could take about 5-6 minutes.</li>
    <li> This shaver does a great job. It is clean, efficient, overall I give the shaver itself a 5 star.    However, once you use the shaver, you have to put it back into a plastic cleaning dock that cleans the shaving heads and recharges the battery.     The fit of the shaver into the dock is so inadequate that the blue led on the shaver (the one that shows it is charging) sometimes flashes intermittently. (the dock does fantastic light shows while this happens...) You start the cleaning cycle and the shaver vibrates away from the charging contacts. So the cleaning cycle stops. The only reliable way I can get it to clean is to hold the shaver into the dock for 19 minutes. Doesn&#x27;t that defeat the purpose of the electric shaver?    Shaver is great. Cleaning system sucks.</li>
    <li> This shaver is the best one to own.The claims of this shaver are on the money.I have owned Braun shavers and they are the best brand for closeness and dependability.</li>
    <li> The product met with my needs for shaving. I had looked for a good shaving head system. This one will take care of my aging face and clean without using so much that I get burns on my face.  I like the cleaning holder system.  I have found that I keep the shaving head clean and always ready for shaving. I have a soft pouch for caring as I travel. The hard case sure makes the item bulky in the overnighter.  The motor noise is no more noiser than the other shavers.  I am sure that I will use this Braun as my major razor cutter. Try to keep this series on the market so the replacements and cleaning parts are kept on the shelve.  I see they are in most the major stores like Walmart, Walgreens and others.</li>
    <li> If you are not into electric shavers, this one might just change your opinion. I just couldn&#x27;t keep shelling out all the money for replacement blades anymore. This was amazing! So close! And it stays sharp for a LONG, LONG time! Guess quality is to be expected when all the company employees shave AFTER they get to the job to use and test their products. That&#x27;s my kind of company! Their care shows in the products. Keep it up! We are very particular about healthy personal care and environmentally friendly lifestyles in our home. If this was solar powered, it would be perfect! btw: Half of the time I have to borrow it back from my wife. That should tell you something.</li>
    <li> this braun is my 3rd shaver, all lasting over 7 years.  I have no issues with this shaver or any others that I have had.</li>
    <li> I could not be more pleased with my new Braun shaver. Previously, I had an Norelco, which I thought was good, but it doesn&#x27;t compare to this new Braun.  The cleaning feature is teriffic. I only wish I had purchased it sooner. --- Bob Jones, Sachse, Texas</li>
    <li> After having used a Remington MS-1700 foil shaver for about the last 10 years, I realized that every time I used it, my face would burn and feel raw. Rarely could I use that two days in a row, having to let my face heal every other day between uses, and I would have to use a disposable razor on the off days. I ordered this Braun razor after having seen it on one of those &#x27;How it&#x27;s made&#x27; shows, and having done quite a bit of research online, comparing to other models and brands. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the cleaning system (although if I clean the razor after every shave like they recommend for the best performance, I&#x27;ll have to buy a new cleaning cartridge every 30 days, which I think is a bit excessive) and I absolutely love the fact that I can plug the cord directly into the razor and shave in cord-mode, or cordless if  the unit is properly charged. So I was able to shave right out of the box.    After having 3 or 4 days of beard growth, I used this with no pre-shave gel or anything like that, and it left my face smoother than any foil razor ever has. Even the tough spots (where the longer hairs tend to lie flat) were no match for this one. It was worth every penny, and I&#x27;ll probably never buy another brand of razor for the rest of my life.    Great product Braun!    Update: About 6 months after I started using this razor, I noticed it started to pinch my skin, and I was sorely disappointed. Silly me, even with regular cleaning cycles, I had neglected to realize that the foil and blades needed replaced. Once I did so, the razor again worked like the day I got it, and I&#x27;ve never had a cleaner shave. I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with this razor!    Update: Four years later (Oct/2014) I&#x27;m still using this razor. I replace the foils and blades about every 6-8 months, and it still leaves me with as clean of a shave. I&#x27;ve taken this on several trips (some of them a week long or more) and I never need to take my charging cable. (Although I still do), and even after a week of shaving on vacation, the battery charge never dropped below around 60%. I still couldn&#x27;t be happier with this shaver, and will definitely continue to use Braun if I have to purchase another one in the future.</li>
    <li> Great product, best shave I ever had.  Worthy of it&#x27;s high ratings and worth the money.  Love the cleaning system</li>
    <li> I needed a new shaver and was really disappointed in my second Philips Norelco rotary model, so I decided to spend some money and try out this foil model. My problem with the Norelco was that it wasn&#x27;t getting very close, and it pulled more hair that it cut even after a new set of blades. After getting the new unit, I plugged it in and did my usual shave. Usually new shavers are rough on my face for the first two weeks(I&#x27;m been using a mach 3 for a few months after getting fed up with my rotary), pulling hairs and giving me razor burn. After mentally preparing for the beat down I expected to my face, I started out and started the shaver up and went to town. I was surprised to find that shaving with this unit is much less painful than my old rotary models, and does a much better/closer job with much less pain. I skipped the aftershave and 3/4 of the way through the day my skin feels fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros I see:&lt;br /&gt;Close shave, w/minimal burn&lt;br /&gt;A very nice travel case included, which it didn&#x27;t mention on the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons I see:&lt;br /&gt;You need to replace the cleaning fluid every month. It&#x27;s fairly cheap, but none the less you have to do it.&lt;br /&gt;The included AC Adapter makes a very faint high pitch noise.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning cycle is fairly loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all probably the best shaving experience I&#x27;ve had. I would highly recommend this shaver. Considering that it is a tool that you will use every day, it is well worth the money in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I almost never review products on Amazon, however, given that I relied on the reviews to buy this product I felt the need to comment in this instance. I have been using a Braun electric razor for many years, probably 3 or four models over time, and was in the market to replace my 8985 which was getting on in years. I figured rather than replace the blades for the third time on the 8985 I might as well upgrade to the \\&quot;latest and greatest\\&quot;. Big mistake. I have been shaving with the 7-790cc for about a month or so now and within 8 hours of shaving it feels as if I never shaved. I waited over a month to write this review to give my face / skin a chance to adjust to the new razor as suggested, however, I am going to go back to my old 8985 since the shave was much closer. I would have expected a major improvement when spending over $200, however, unfortunately this shaver was a step backwards.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor because I like how quick and efficient electric razors are, but I have very sensitive skin, and the braun website said this razor was good for sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve tried norelco rotary razors and I don&#x27;t like them at all. They miss a lot of hairs which means I have to go over the same areas over and over which means wicked bad razor burn. I&#x27;ve also tried traditional razors with sensitive skin shave cream. I even used the gilette fusion since I was told nicer blades get a closer shave with less irritation. I did get a close shave but not a whole lot less irritation. I&#x27;d never tried a foil razor before but my roommate has one and he loves his, so I figured if I&#x27;m going to get one I might as well go for the best; a good choice on my part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The braun pulsonic is great, it gets a really close shave and hardly any irritation if any at all, and it&#x27;s quick and gets almost all the hairs the first time. Now I must admit, it does not get as close as a traditional blade, but it is pretty darn close, the closest you will find from any electric razor. Also if you don&#x27;t shave for a few days and your facial hair gets a little long this razor does tend to pull a little, but I&#x27;ve found that if you shave with the hair growth first and then go back over against the growth it works really well. As for my sensitive skin, this razor is awesome. I used to only shave every three or four days because my skin is so sensitive, now I shave every other day no problem. The only area I get any irritation now is on the neck, and if I do get any (emphasis on \\&quot;if\\&quot;) it is very minimal. Also since it is an electric razor I don&#x27;t have to mess with shaving cream and constantly washing the blade off, so it is much faster and efficient, which I need being a college student.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The self-cleaning station is great too. Once I&#x27;m done shaving I just stick the razor back in the stand, it automatically assesses what cleaning cycle to run, and I just push the big \\&quot;clean\\&quot; button and away it goes. Oh, and it charges at the same time. The only down side is you have to buy their special cleaner refill cartridges, but you can get them pretty cheap online. Each one lasts about a month, but I think that is assuming you shave and run the cleaning cycle every day. There is an indicator on the stand that tells you how full the cleaning fluid is and when you need to change it, so as long as you have spares on hand they are very simple to switch out. Also the cleaning cycle is a little loud so if you have a spouse or anyone who wakes up later then you you may want to run the cleaning cycle later. Also some of the other reviews are complaining that the razor is too loud and shakes too much due to the pulsonic technology. That&#x27;s crap, it&#x27;s not any louder than any other electric razor, and the shaking is the same as that gilette fusion power razor that does the same thing, it&#x27;s not enough to make shaving difficult or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people may be skeptical of their instructions that say to shave against the hair growth and to shave before you take a shower. Everyone knows that typically shaving against the hair growth causes irritation, but despite this belief shaving against the growth with the pulsonic works, do it. Just don&#x27;t let your beard get too intense or as I stated earlier it will pull a little. As far as shaving before or after a shower I&#x27;ve tried both ways and I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference, try it out for yourself and do whichever you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all I love this razor, one of the best buys I&#x27;ve ever made. It&#x27;s definitely the best shave you will get out of an electric razor, and if you&#x27;ve got sensitive skin like me this razor will be your best friend.es. Oh, and it charges at the same time.

Also the cleaning cycle is a little loud so if you have a spouse or anyone who wakes up later then you you may want to run the cleaning cycle later. Also some of the other reviews are complaining that the razor is too loud and shakes too much due to the pulsonic technology. That&#x27;s crap, it&#x27;s not any louder than any other electric razor, and the shaking is the same as that gilette fusion power razor that does the same thing, it&#x27;s not enough to make shaving difficult or anything.    Some people may be skeptical of their instructions that say to shave against the hair growth and to shave before you take a shower. Everyone knows that typically shaving against the hair growth causes irritation, but despite this belief shaving against the growth with the pulsonic works, do it. Just don&#x27;t let your beard get too intense or as I stated earlier it will pull a little. As far as shaving before or after a shower I&#x27;ve tried both ways and I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference, try it out for yourself and do whichever you like.     All-in-all I love this razor, one of the best buys I&#x27;ve ever made. It&#x27;s definitely the best shave you will get out of an electric razor, and if you&#x27;ve got sensitive skin like me this razor will be your best friend.</li>
    <li> Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic  Shaver]]    I am 72 years old and this is the best shaver I have ever owned. I liked it so much I bought another one and sent to my son.    Also I like buying from Amazon, because they always sell top quality products with fast delivery....and great prices.</li>
    <li> I needed to replace my old Braun 7570 that broke, so I decided to pick this one up. Although a bit steep in price, I must say that it does shave a bit closer than my old model. The pop out trimmer is a joy to use and can be easily used to trim the side burns. The only negative I have with it is the plastic case that only fits the shaver and not the cord. I did keep my old case that fits a cord so i will use that also for traveling :)  I was also hoping that I could have used the old cord from my older braun shaver with the newer one to travel with, but it is a diffent plug unfortunately.</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun shaving systems since the mid 80&#x27;s.  Completely satisfied until purchasing this system.  Do not know whether this is due to P&amp;G taking ownership, but they have definitely gone from a top of the line product to not worth the box it came in.  My unit has been back for warranty service 4 times since purchase, and I have no confidence that it will last another 4 months.  Don&#x27;t waste your money..on this overpriced headache !!!!!</li>
    <li> For fifty years I have been a confirmed steel blade shaver.  Over the years I have had several electric shavers but always found them to provide inferior shaving results compared to steel blade shaving.  Recently I watched an online documentary of the Braun 360 Series 7 Pulsonic  manufacture and testing.  I was impressed and decided to review my dislike for electric shavers via Consumers [...] and elsewhere.  What I found was Braun&#x27;s product was indeed well reviewed albeit more expensive that everyone else&#x27;s product.  Nonetheless, I bought one and started to use it daily.  At first the shaver was having trouble clearing whiskers under my chin and on my neck but gave really steel blade like results on the rest of my face.  I read thast it takesd a while for your face/whiskers to adjust to an electric shaver.  That turned out to be the case. I now get really superb shaves all over at least for that day: I have to shave again the next morning which I was able to skip when using my old four-blade steel razor.  The product has a very clever cleaning system with good electronic displays but a downside consideration thereof is the cleaning solution cartridges which you will have to purchase for the life of your razon.  They are not too expensive but they do add to the cost forever.  I am looking into developing a cleaning solution substitute which I could load a cartridge: probably some alchole and water would do; I am still exploring.  Despite this short-coming, I heartily recommend the product.</li>
    <li> I have had a Braun Activator since about 2004 and have loved shaving with it, after many years of using blades... Only had one problem with it, the base unit died after 18 months. But, Braun replaced the base and charger under warranty, no sweat.. Lately, I started reading about what&#x27;s new and thought I&#x27;d try the newer Pulsonic 790. I think my old Activator may be built better, at least it feels more solid and hefty.. But, the new 790cc does a better job of shaving with fewer strokes.. The 790cc is also MUCH quieter, so I can watch (and hear) the morning news as I shave.     There are some on-line reviews that indicate some issues with the finish peeling off and the trimmer breaking.. I never had those issues with my Activator, after 6 years of daily use. And I hope that I don&#x27;t have those issues with my new Pulsonic either!! Time will tell.. Meanwhile, it provides a close, comfortable shave and clean up is easy !!!</li>
    <li> This Braun shaver is my second, replacing my previous braun I received as a gift. I had replaced the shaving heads many times renewing the shaving quality. I also went onEbay to replace the cleaning/storage tower. Rating gets 4 stars. Amazon e-mailed offer of the Braun 7 series which I purchased.  Braun has made several changes which I rate 5 star. Thank you Braun &amp; Amazon,until next time.</li>
    <li> I had been using a rotary shaver for 20+ years and thought I would try a non rotary shaver and give that type of shaver a go. After doing much online investigation I settled on the Braun 7 Series and purchased the 790cc model. After using it for several weeks I am very pleased at it&#x27;s close shave performance without the nicks and sores on my skin. The self cleaning is an added bonus. I recommend this shaver without hesitation.</li>
    <li> I have used the Braun line of shavers for quite sometime, this model has improved all features.  Very happy with how it works and provides an even better shave than previous models.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I have been a diehard Norelco shaver since 1973. When my last one broke, I read some reviews and decided to try the Braun Series 7 - 790cc. The first time I tried it I was sold. I have NEVER had a shave this close before! I like the way it feels in my hands and follows the contours of my face. It really pays to try something different once in awile!</li>
    <li> The razor is great.  I do not like the trimmer.  Its great for sidburns, but moustaches and beards the razor blocks the view of what you are trimming</li>
    <li> Choosing a new electric shaver may be one of the worst experiences of your life if you read all of the reviews like I did.  For each good review there is a bad one.  I read them all and finally couldn&#x27;t take it anymore and bought the top of the line Braun because it won the awards from Consumer Reports and Men&#x27;s Health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Norelco rotary shaver finally gave out so I decided to try something new.  I didn&#x27;t think I wanted a shaver with a self cleaning system but once I tried it I was amazed by how cool it is.  The shaver comes out clean and with a lemony sent.  How great is that? I look forward to shaving now.  I&#x27;m not regretting the change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Close shave, as close as you want it.  Spend enough time on it and you will have a baby smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;Auto-clean with lemon scent.&lt;br /&gt;No more opening the top and shaking it over the toilet or garbage can to dump clippings.&lt;br /&gt;Rock solid construction.  It&#x27;s metal and heavy with a rubber back for grip.  Very well made by samurais in germany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Expensive.&lt;br /&gt;You need to go over neck areas against the grain of your beard a lot to get a close shave there, much more so than my last rotary shaver.  But once achieved, the closeness is better than a rotary provides.&lt;br /&gt;Louder than a rotary.  Bzzzzzzzz.&lt;br /&gt;Buying replacement cleaning solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see the price went way up after I bought it.  I bought it for $189, looks like it is for sale on Amazon for $250+ now following the same link I purchased it from.  What&#x27;s that all about?  Not sure I would pay that.  For under $200, buy it.  Every other good electric shaver is $140 and up anyway.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 2012:  Some of the silver coating on the back of the razor near the head piece has bubbled and peeled away and it is black underneath.  This was most likely caused by the cleaning solution.  Apparently it is coated with a paint that reacts to the cleaning solution.  I peeled it away with my fingernail.The razor is less attractive now, but still functions very well.  The total area of the peeling is about 1/8th of an inch tall and across the entire back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 2014: My old Braun continues to function flawlessly.  I have had no new paint loss after the initial problem and the cleaning station looks and functions as good as the day it was new.  Not sure what the Braun company is making now (obviously not the model I bought), but if they still make the same quality products they made when I bought mine, then buy with confidence.  I have had no battery issues or performance issues.  It charges and cleans like new after all these years. I replaced the foil once a while ago and that was the only maintenance.  Money very well spent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once, but the results were WOW!  A very close shave for the 1st shave, using an electric razor is excellent all by itself!  Add to that, that I haven&#x27;t shaved in 3 days is amazing!  I cannot wait for my face to get used to this razor.</li>
    <li> Not sure where to start on this thing yet but I will say it is totally made of win. This is hands down the best electric razor I&#x27;ve come across yet, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them; at least 10-15 shavers. I can actually get my neck with this shaver which was previously quite impossible. The battery life is unexpectedly good and the cleaning/lubrication system works great as well. Nothing negative to say at all really.    Some tips for people looking for an electric razor:  1.) Make sure to give your face time to adjust. I forget the actual time period required but it is a few weeks.  2.) Just because this works well on my face doesn&#x27;t mean it will work that well on yours so you may have to try out multiple razors. For example: the three headed circular shavers irritate the skin on my neck but the bar shaped ones do not.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband through Amazon in early June. By early August the shaver stopped charging. I am BUYING a new cord to see if this is the problem. If it isn&#x27;t resolved, I&#x27;ll be calling Braun for a replacement because this is an expensive shaver. Seriously, I don&#x27;t want to deal with these issues when I pay a lot for an item.</li>
    <li> This is my second Braun shaver and it is an excellent quality unit just like my first one. The improvements in this model now make it feel about three times better to shave. Furthermore the cleaning functionality is much improved and a pleasure to use. On top of all that, I purchased this from Amazon and shipped it to Australia using a virtual mailbox, this saved me at least 45% cost including the shipping as compared to purchasing from a local vendor. Excellent shaver and a great price!</li>
    <li> Have had Braun shavers for years now.  Was a little surprised that my face took a couple of weeks to get used to this one.  This new cutting head does a lot better than my old Braun (Model 7526) in some areas like my upper lip and my chin.  I think the much faster pulsing of the cutter heads helps.  But I still like my older Braun better for other areas like my neck.  I&#x27;m hoping my neck just needs to get used to it as well.  I definitely like the pop-out trimmer on the old Braun better.  This new one sticks out far from the razor body and is narrow and is a bit akward to use.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver. I can shave every day without irritation. Because the base does the cleaning for me I don&#x27;t have to worry about the condition of the blade, it&#x27;s taken care off.    And the digital display telling you when it needs to be cleaned is surprising accurate.    I highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Used a Norelco for many years. Wanted to try something out that would give a better shave. This was certainly it. Didn&#x27;t pull at all. Awesome shaver.</li>
    <li> I do not find this razor $130 better than my old Norelco which cost $70. Within a few hours my face feels like it needs a shave again. Also, the flip out long hair cutter is not very convenient as it sticks out of the front and, therefore, is difficult to reach place like the top of the ear or inside the ear.</li>
    <li> I have always had an older Braun that I used for a \\&quot;quick once over\\&quot;, but always used a blade for a truly close shave. My older Braun finally gave out (over 20 years)and I bought the Series 7. What an amazing electric shaver! I now use my new Braun for my morning shave. Although not quite as close as a blade, this does a great job. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is without a doubt the best electric shaver I have ever owned. Close shaves are the norm with this shaver, with virtually no stubble left after shaving. This is a no brainer decision if you are looking for a shaver that gives close shaves and cleans itself. A little pricey, but I&#x27;d do it again.</li>
    <li> Having used several previous Braun shavers this model is a pleasant continuation of a good brand of shaver. Ergonomically, its longer and slightly narrower shape takes a little getting used to. Everything else is top notch. It shaves faster and closer than previouis models I have owned, has a great cleaning/charging system, gives the user several cleaning options and has a much larger pivot on the shaving head (keeping it in contact with your skin longer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels and operates like a quality product  and has reduced my shaving time in half. If there is a downside it would be the cost to replace the shaving head/blades but even that is overshadowed by the quality of the end result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A big YES for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 month Update: After 2 months of use the ergonomic issue is gone . . . replaced by the versaitility the different shape offers. The cleaning options are even better than I had originally thought, allowing total control over when and how much to clean the razor. The instant option seems to save on cleaning solution while giving a fresh feel to each shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus is the travel case. It completely encases the shaver giving total protection and a small cleaning brush fits in the case without taking unneeded space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great shaver.</li>
    <li> I got this for the &#x27;08 Holidays as a present and love it.  I had another braun shaver (6000 or 7000 series) which I liked too but it was 6+ years old.  I decided I would make the old shaver my travel shaver.  Anyway, I got the Pulsonic and bought a new blade and foil for my old shaver at the same time so I wouldn&#x27;t have to pack a toiletry bag each time I travel.  I have not gone back to that old razor.  I loved it last year when I didn&#x27;t know how easy it is to shave with the Pulsonic.  I probably spend half the time shaving with the Pulsonic and I get a better shave.  I love this razor and it is not wearing off--I have had it for almost 6 months now.  It is expensive but it works great.</li>
    <li> To be brief:  money was not a factor so I decided to buy the best shaver available and chose the Braun Series 7 Pulsonic model.  I already owned a Braun Series 3 (340)that I kept in my apartment.  I cannot tell any difference between the two in most regards.  If you gave me a blind test and asked me to choose between the two, the only thing that is noticeable is that the Pulsonic is heavier.  Otherwise, they are both good shavers but the Series 7 is certainly not worth the far greater expense and I would not repeat the purchase if given the chance to do so.</li>
    <li> In nearly every review one reads about shavers and razors, people tell you that you should try the product for at least 30 days to let your skin and hairs adjust. And that your shave will improve. I have an especially thick and heavy beard and always go for the best my money can buy--so after my Panasonic failed, I tried this one, the Braun 790cc.    Initially, the shave was awful.  After 45 days, not only was the shave still awful, but the shaver stopped communicating with the charging/cleaning base so neither function was possible anymore.    So, deciding I gave this product a very fair trial period, and giving up on electric shavers in general, I ordered a safety razor (and supplies).  Then, I contacted Amazon only to find that because the cleaning solution is a hazadarous material, it is impossible for the shaver to be returned.   And 45 days is past the typical 30 day maximum return period anyways.    Of note, a paid quite a lot for this now-gimped shaver (that I&#x27;m now stuck with), however the price has DOUBLED since I bought it less than 2 months ago!    So buyer beware. You cannot simply \\&quot;try\\&quot; this shaver. Once you&#x27;ve bought it, it&#x27;s yours. If it doesn&#x27;t shave well, you&#x27;re stuck with it. Enjoy.    Pros:  The battery life is great! ...</li>
    <li> I own two shavers, One Norelco \\&quot;Quadra Action\\&quot; and this \\&quot;Braun Pulsonic series 7\\&quot;, which I purchased in October 2009.  I had lots of time to evaluate this item and compare it with my Norelco.  I regret to say that Norelco shavers are presently, by far, the best shavers available in the markets. I purchased the Pulsonic at the time my Norelco was in need of new Ni-Cad batteries.  Big mistakes of my part, I trusted the four-stars rating +given and decided to try this new model to have as a spare shaver.  First, I received the shaver in an elaborate packaging (most likely expensive) accompanied with a bulky contraption that Braun calls \\&quot;The Clean &amp;Renew System\\&quot;. This unit serves as a combination to clean and recharge the shaver when needed and it does require a cleaning cartridge filled with a special cleaning fluid.  That&#x27;s another costly item that must be purchased periodically.  If you are traveling forget about that cleaning gadget...  Leave it home!  The shaver can recharged with the cord provided and also cleaned under the faucet in your bathroom.  Second, the shaver does not give a shave any closer that my Norelco, the head has straight lateral cutters and the friction of the cutters in motion creates heath giving a burning sensation to the skin... not very pleasant!  The fact that the head has straight cutters, it doesn&#x27;t espouses the contours of the face very well; unlike my Norelco which has three individual round cutters that gimbals separately on their own axis, a very useful feature, especially on the neck around the jawbones.  Third, the trimmer is useless if you have to trim a mustache, it&#x27;s only good for sideburns.  The trimmer is hidden from view, while looking in a mirror if you are trying to groom a mustache or trim hairs from the nose.  The trimmer is lower than the head of the shaver and is hidden from view while looking at the mirror making it impossible to see what you are trimming.  With the Norelco shavers there are no problems with the trimmer.  I do not recommend the Braun \\&quot;Pulsonic\\&quot; series 7 shaver, it is overpriced and over rated, it only deserve a HALF STAR.  M. J.</li>
    <li> Just as with all new electric shavers my face took a little while to get \\&quot;broke in\\&quot; to the new razor. I hadn&#x27;t shaved for about 6 weeks (trimmed only) after my other Braun (of 10 years duration) finally broke down. So the first time I used this new razor it got quite a workout. I wasn&#x27;t too happy with the results of that shave of the next 2 or 3 but then I remembered (it had been 10 years ok?) that it took a while for my face and \\&quot;beard\\&quot; to get used to using an electric razor. After that initial break-in period it works great! Its a bit lighter than the previous Braun model but rests very easy in the hand, its not overweight and seems to be balanced well. The way the \\&quot;foils\\&quot; and head all move independently makes shaving a quite easy task. The cleaning \\&quot;station\\&quot; worked well once I figured it out. Also it uses the same cleaning fluid refills as my older model (I had like 6 of those reills still around). All in all I would recommend this to a friend for sure.</li>
    <li> I pulled the trigger on the $200 razor because I thought it would be much better than my last $80 razor. It is better, I&#x27;m just not sure its $120 better. I&#x27;m disappointed in it&#x27;s tendency to miss a few longer whiskers after, say, not shaving over the weekend, and the trimmer location makes it hard to be accurate around the edge of my beard. The razor&#x27;s \\&quot;hygiene\\&quot; indicator telling me the shaver needs \\&quot;intensive cleaning\\&quot; after 3 shaves strikes me as a shameless effort to sell cleaning fluid refills (of course nothing requires you to give it the intensive cleaning at that point). On the up side, I do think the razor does give a closer shave overall to any electric I&#x27;ve used in the past. Just not the stark improvement I expected for the price.</li>
    <li> About once every 15 years, I buy an electric shaver hoping that their performance has improved to a point where they are competitive with blade razors.  After four months of using this Braun Series 7, I think that time has not yet arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For comparison purposes, I previously, and now once again, shave with a Schick Mach 3 razor, which gives me an objectively superior, closer, more comfortable shave, with less skin irritation, in less time.  The Braun takes forever to get a close shave, and even then, leaves single, isolated whiskers uncut, seemingly at random.  While the Braun doesn&#x27;t cause the occasional nick to my face that the blade razor sometimes does, I find that it actually results in more skin irritation than the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, this Braun is expensive, requires regular investments in cleaning cartridges, and takes up valuable bathroom shelf space, all of which would be okay if it worked well, but it doesn&#x27;t, at least on my face.  Save your money and buy a good blade instead.</li>
    <li> dont expect 50 promo code unless you fight for it. they will keep putting you off.  many bad reviews at amazon  what happened to amazon?</li>
    <li> I have always used Braun shavers and this latest doesn&#x27;t disappoint. Price was the best I could find. Cleaning mode works as well as advertized. Carry case is pretty cheap looking though compared to older models.</li>
    <li> A very good product with many innovations. Pricey but if you shop around you will save some cash. I have been using it for about a month and am pleased with the shave. Tried other brands and Braun leads my list.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and was in perfect condition.  Performance of product is very good.</li>
    <li> After so many years using razor blade and also trying all other type of electric shaving machines, I finaly did purchase the most comfortable, close shave and cleanest electric shaverone I have seen and I am very delighted to use this Braun electric shaver every day and enjoy close shave while maintaining the highest higene possible.</li>
    <li> Bought this shaver at the end of june 2009 and loved the way it shaves.  I had an older, much less expensive Braun an it was falling apart after about 3 years.  Because I like the way it shaved,  I went for the upper end Braun.  AS I said, I loved the shave from the pulsonic.  After about 3 weeks it quit working like the on-off switch was bad.  I tried to contact Braun and to see how I could get a replacement but the best info I could find was to send it to a Braun repair center.  So now this very expensive,  top of the line shaver is in a repair shop where they ordered a new \\&quot;board\\&quot;.  I am most disappointed that I had to spend $9 more to send it off and I&#x27;ll be getting a repaired shaver that is less than a month old.  Not what I would expect from one of the most successful shaver companies.  I&#x27;m sure I could have spent a few hours trying to get a better avenue from Braun if I wanted to invest the time.  I really expected the repair shop to simply request a replacement for unit less than a month old.  I&#x27;m waiting for it to come back and hoping it will be fixed to where it doesn&#x27;t required more service.</li>
    <li> A huge improvement over the synchro 7520 (my shaver for the last 5 years). Cleanest and smoothest shave that I have had. No burns and no chips. Very comfortable to use.    I cannot comment on whether or not it is worth the price tag and the slightly high cost of maintenance but I can certainly attest that this shaver will blow your mind away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for about six months and it does a nice job of shaving, however today was the third time it has cut my lip (when shaving the corner of my mouth).  It must be a design flaw in the long hair trimmer?  That&#x27;s the only thing I can think of that is cutting my lip.  They already replace the head and that obviously didn&#x27;t help.  Therefore I don&#x27;t recommend this shaver.      Also, you should note that the cleaning system in these new shavers are not like the old days where you can just open it, brush or blow it out and keep going.  You need to use their solution and station or rinse it in water, but if using water it won&#x27;t dry out unless you remove the head and set it off to the side (basically it&#x27;s a pain and those cleaning kits are expensive).</li>
    <li> Have used Norelcos for 35 years and enjoyed the replacements every 7 years or so as they constantly improved.  Got the Arcitec over a year ago expecting the same experience.  It never shaved well.  I didn&#x27;t return it in the 30 day window figuring with the new head design I had to learn how best to use it.  Well, 12 months later I got tired of looking like a mendicant and rubbing my face raw to try to get a clean shave.  Purchased this based on it&#x27;s strong review in Consumer Reports.  It performs tremendously well.  Though I&#x27;ve been an electric razor user forever it&#x27;s shave was so close I got that \\&quot;first time using an electric shaver\\&quot; skin irritation which has gone away but shows just how effective this is compared to the Norelco.  I even like the cleaning unit;  while I&#x27;ll have to replace the cartridges I&#x27;m hopeful it&#x27;ll keep the razor performing well since it lubricates as well.  I recommend this razor for having exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> I have a very thick Latino-like beard. It did not shave well under the chin, nor the neck. It was smooth to shave and it did not irritate my skin, it just did not shave well. All in all it was just like the Phillips-Nivea I have, which I like better because it shaves with a cream and feels smooth. I am still waiting for a shaver that will do a good job shaving under the jaw and the neck.</li>
    <li> I broke from a 15 year habit of using 2 Norelco electrics, and bought the Braun.  After giving it 4 months, it just didn&#x27;t cut as well as my decade old Norelco.  I didn&#x27;t think that was possible, so I contacted customer service.  They were fantastic!  They sent me a new cutterhead.    I put on the new head, and immediately it cut closer.  I thought my problems were solved, but after 3 weeks of using the new head, it started pulling my hair HARD.  Every morning now it&#x27;s pulling my hair a dozen times during a shave, and it&#x27;s VERY painful.  Went back to the old cutterhead, and it&#x27;s not pulling my hair, but I don&#x27;t get a smooth shave either.      Don&#x27;t know what I could be doing wrong.  I&#x27;m following every single one of their \\&quot;tips\\&quot;, and I&#x27;m cleaning it after EVERY shave.    This is a dud.</li>
    <li> I purchased this based on positive reviews, however I am now convinced many of those reviews are suspect.  After a year&#x27;s use I have concluded this is an overpriced piece of junk. The closeness of the shave is poor at best, and it does a terrible job of shaving under the nose.  The cleaning station lights have completely stopped working, and the pivoting head lock for under the nose shaving no longer works.  Save your money and look at other manufacturers.</li>
    <li> This razor feels powerful and strong right out of the box.  You will not be disappointed with this pricey investment guys.  It shaves closer and more important, more comfortably then all the other foil razors I&#x27;ve owned.  It also comes with a nice plastic case that has a cleaning brush and brush holder built into the case.  My concern was the cleaning system.  I hate getting strapped in to spending money on previously unnecessary items for razor care.  But the cleaning feature is a nice feature that works relatively well.  The instructions indicate you can run the razor under tap water to clean it if you don&#x27;t want to use the cleaning system.  It says to use razor oil on foils after tap cleaning.  I don&#x27;t do this because I found out the cleaning system is resealable, so if you don&#x27;t use up all the cleanser the 1st time and it&#x27;s not dirty you can reuse it again without spending tons of money on cleaning product.  The trimmer also works great.  This razor does a excellent job at comfortably shaving the neck area comparing to my old foil shavers that always pulled hairs in that area instead of cut them.      The only cons are the built in battery/hygiene indicator on bottom of the razor has some issues.  When the hygiene is low your razor will automatically cut off.  This seems like a unnecessary feature that doesn&#x27;t work right.  I had just cleaned my razor and the hygiene indicator ran out quickly and the razor cut off.  This has only happened once though, and I was able to get it to start again by removing my foil cover and putting it back on.  This may have just been a fluke.  My other issue is that the razor was indeed extremely quiet when first purchased, but over the past few months it has grown louder then it originally was.  Again minor, but these are reasons why it shouldn&#x27;t get a perfect score.    Would I buy it again?  YES   Is it a great foil razor? YES  Is it worth all that money? YES (with proper care it will last you a long time guys)</li>
    <li> This Braun shaver is the best. It is like my Gillette Fusion razor. It gets close to the skin without the irritation</li>
    <li> This razor caught my eyes quite a while back, but due the fact that I had a perfectly good aging Norelco, I strayed away from it.  During my last deployment though, my Norelco&#x27;s battery finally failed.  After 10 months of shaving with a blade, I realized it was time to purchase an electric razor again.  My first electric was a Braun 4525 which I made the mistake of leaving out for someone else to take and remembering how much I loved that razor, decided it was time for another Braun.  Now I know everybody has different adjustment periods and Braun claims that it can take up to 3 weeks for your face to adjust, but for me it was instantaneous.  Part of this might be due to military requirements that have me shave everyday or some other unknown reason, but either way my face adapted immediately to this razor.  Now for the part that sets this razor above my Norelco.  On weekends, I have never been one to bother with the razor as I get enough of it Monday through Friday and everyday during deployments, so I enjoy letting my beard go.  This has always meant that on my first day back to work, that I would have to break out the shaving cream and blade for a first day of the week back shave.  To my surprise though after a four day weekend I grabbed my Braun and to my amazement had the most comfortable shave ever!!!  This feat was only tried once with my previous electric and after the rash and pain went away chalked up as a never try this again lesson.  As far as some of the complaints I have read, is it louder than a whisper?  Yes, it&#x27;s an electric razor.  Will it wake your significant other in the morning while you are shaving with the door closes?  No and neither will the cleaning cycle.  Speaking of the cleaning cycle, my Norelco would have whiskers fall out and pepper my sink area, but this is another issue resolved by the base unit.  Is the cleaning solution too expensive?  Even a frugal person such as myself can afford to buy a years supply for around $56 and not losesleep over it.  As for those who complain about the hygiene meter not reseting to full after washing under water, try reading the manufacturers instructions.  The bottom line here is this is an exceptional razor and if you are required to shave every Monday through Friday and like to let the beard go when you can, than this is the razor for you, stop looking and buy it.  Military personnel you have found your closest inspection ready shave to date, buy this razor!!!</li>
    <li> Experiment Failed  One day, after using a regular \\&quot;old-fashion\\&quot; razor-blade shaving, I decided to try Braun shaver.  Well, it is not like I never tried electrical shavers before.  I&#x27;ve had Phillips rotating-cutter shavers.  Knowing for sure that none of tese electrical shavers could beat a razor blade (meaning that I did not even try to compare razor with electrics), I was still quite disappointed with Braun product in comparison with other types of electrical shavers.  Here are the problems:  The foil seems to be having holes that are too small, so the hair (especially on under the chin, neck area) does not get caught into the foil, so the vibrating blade has nothing to cut.  After shaving with Braun, I get many places on my face with this single uncaught hairs sticking here and there.  It looks weird.  The shaving takes forever and it requires many passes over the same area.  I have to shave twice (!) a day, otherwise my face looks like if I did not bother shaving at all.  I should say, if I ever use electric shavers again, I will get a rotary-type.  It will not be as smooth as a razor blade shaving, but at least, I would not have uncaught and uncut hairs on my face).</li>
    <li> My first proper electric shaver...and how it performs!!    Firstly , the shaving experience is incredible.  A very clean shave in most parts of the face.The face takes a few shaves to get used to though.  and once you are used to it it probably takes about 5 minutes per shave.    The cleaning system is very good too.And very easy to use.   Have used it for a month now so not sure how long the cartridge work but most says it&#x27;s for 30 shaves.So yes a continued expense but no cream or new blades and you don&#x27;t use any water!!    Overall feel of the shaver is one of a most efficiently created piece of equipment which I hope works for a long time to come.</li>
    <li> This is the second Braun razor I have owned and it is superior to the first. It is a solid, perhaps a bit heavy, machine that does a great job. It is not a one-pass device, I need to run it over and over the same areas to get a good shave, and I need to work the neck/chin area with extra attention, but when I&#x27;m through it is the closest shave I&#x27;ve had yet, and it certainly doesnt take any longer than previous shavers I&#x27;ve owned. I bought a Norelco in between my Braun&#x27;s (because I wanted to buy American) but it was terrible and felt cheaply made. Cons: the wall plug is too long before the cord bends down, so that it unseats from being plugged into the wall by its own weight, the cleaner stand is cheap plastic looking in comparison to the high-end look of the shaver, and its real noisy when cleaning. Pros: I have researched online several folks who have reused the cleaner cartridge and made their own cleaner solutions which is what I will do, great shaver, worth the expensive price.</li>
    <li> I received this as a christmas gift from my girlfriend 2 years ago and have been thoroughly enjoying using it the entire time.  Prior to this I had been using a three headed electric for many years, and, although I was satisfied with it&#x27;s performance it does not hold a candle to this razor.  This Braun gives nearly as close a shave as a genuine razor even after 2 years of use.  I still have not replaced the head, even though it says that you should every 18 months.        The cleaning system works surprisingly well.  I&#x27;m still not sure how it sucks the hair out of there but it does.  You can find the replacement cartridges on amazon in bulk by the way, which, ends up being quite a lot cheaper than buying them in the store.  The flip up trimmer works great as well.       Can&#x27;t say enough how great a razor this is.  It&#x27;s pricy but worth it if you don&#x27;t mind electric.</li>
    <li> Finally after 30 years of shaving, comes the Holy Grail in electric shavers.  During my shaving years I have used a combination of blade and electric shaver during the week.  Usually on a Monday morning I would use the blade to get the close shave I desire.  I would then use an electric shaver for the other 6 days.  My skin is rather soft and sensitive, so use of blade everyday was not possible without immense irritation.  Over the years, I have used an array of different rotary shavers made by Norelco.  These shavers got me by, but they NEVER gave me the close shave as the \\&quot;Monday\\&quot; blade did.   I could always feel whiskers and by 5:00pm, there was the shadow.  Cleaning of the shaver was messy and the awful Ni-Cad batteries had to be run from top charge to bottom charge in order to get the longest life out of them.  Now after so much searching and years of patiently waiting along comes the Braun 790cc.  I read every review I could find on this unit to be absolutely sure that this one was going to be the answer to my dreams for a easy, quick, close shave.    Well, after a week of hemming and hawing, I bought it.  It was here in 3 days and I charged her up.  The next morning, I gave the Braun 790 a spin for the first time.  I did it as recommended, prior to washing face and showering.  I tried that once with the Norelco and I ended up having to shower and shave again, just to make it look as if I shaved that morning.    For me this 790 gave me the closest shave I have ever experienced using an electric razor in all of my shaving years. When I was finished, my face felt like \\&quot;Monday morning blade smooth\\&quot;. No irritation at all, and SUPER close.  I have been using the Braun 790 for close to 4 weeks now and have never gone back to blade.  There is no need to. The Braun removed that pain from my life!  Bye-bye shaving cream.  I love the automatic cleaning process.  Just set the shaver in the base. The base chooses the correct cleaning cycle based on use and then the next morning I have clean, lemony fresh and oiled shaver ready to go.  Always out of box clean.  And the lithium battery, of which I have always wished for has no memory, so I do not have to run the razor from top to bottom charge anymore.  Just charge it everyday while it is cleaning.  NO problem!  Thank you Braun.  I have never spent over $200 for an electric razor, but it is comforting to know that Braun has created the electric razor that I will use for the rest of my living years. WORTH EVERY PENNEY!  Including the future purchases for cleaning solution.  WORTH EVERY PENNY!  This is the razor that my father had always dreamed of having.  I only wish he could have experienced what I am experiencing these last 4 weeks and for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> I threw the whole shaver away after a year. It does not do the job,&lt;br /&gt;after shaving it feels like as if I did not shave for 3 days. Useless product.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Braun Series 5 8985 (http://www.amazon.com/Braun-Series-5-Mens-Shaver/dp/B000G1EQ1W/dp/B000G1785S) with the Clean and Renew system for over 2 years now. I have purchased new blades as well as a new foil cap within the past year for the razor. I received the Braun Series 7 790cc as a gift this past week. The difference between the two is VERY noticeable. The series 5 is a great razor, but always has difficulty in getting the longer hairs on and around the neck. It would take me about 6-8 minutes to shave with the series 5. It takes me about 2-3 minutes for a closer and more comfortable shave with the new series 7. The \\&quot;Fast Clean\\&quot; feature is outstanding. The razor gets clean within a minute. The full clean is MUCH quieter than the previous generation. Charging seems to take quite a bit less time as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit expensive, but is worth every penny to get the upgrade. If I had known how big of a difference this razor would make, I would have upgraded sooner. I wish I could give this product a sixth star.</li>
    <li> Do not order this item as a gift!!!!!  Even if it is unopened you cannot return it!!&lt;br /&gt;All over the Amazon web site it tells you how easy it is to return items but&lt;br /&gt;they will not return this shaver.</li>
    <li> Purchased this razor for my husband as a christmas gift and he loves it, best gift he has received!!!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product.  I have only used three different electric razors, this being the fourth.  Bar none, the best shave I have ever had with an electric razor!! I do not understand the few bad reviews this product has received.  It is very expensive and thus maybe some individuals are expecting some sort of shaving miracle.  I don&#x27;t know.  However, if you are looking for a new electric razor, or ready to make the switch from traditional blades, this is the product you should buy.  I have never had a shave as close as this product can achieve without some sort of irritation or bumps.  There is zero irritation associated with this shaver.  If you are frugal, but still pull the trigger on buying this, you do not have to use the clean and renew system every time.  It is an option.  You could opt to remove the foil and brush clean it, or hold it under running water.  Bottom line--If you want a fantastic electric razor that shaves as close as a blade as possible without using a blade, this is the one to buy!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Norelco 1050 for almost 2 years. Wasn&#x27;t impressed with it at all in the beginning and I&#x27;m still not now. It made poor shaves, I would have to go over the same spot too many times and it would STILL not shave it clean. It made my shaving time longer and it irritated my skin a lot, but I kept it and used it because it was a good alternative to not get cuts with a regular razor. Well it recently stopped working so I went ahead and got this shaver, I thought,  no more from Norelco, with it&#x27;s poor design that doesn&#x27;t let you keep a straight goatee. I got the Braun 790cc and let me tell you that I was quite impressed with it.    First of all the design is a lot better because it&#x27;s able to shave more part of your face. You can keep your sideburns or goatee straight. It doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s made of cheap parts like the Norelco did. I liked that it also didn&#x27;t feel plasticy and that it didn&#x27;t feel like a kids toy unlike the Norelco. The trimmer is a lot better too, you can see it better and it makes it easier to keep your sideburns nice and straight. It cuts a lot better too. It has a battery and hygiene meter. The battery one comes in handy but the hygiene I feel is either inaccurate or fake. For example, if you clean the inside of your hair and debris with warm water, the hygiene meter will remain the same as if you haven&#x27;t cleaned it at all. It only changes if you put it in the cleaner and let the cleaner do the work, but I think it has something to do with the charger/cleaner that changes the hygiene meter.    Everything works great. The shaver itself shaves very closely. Gives you a clean shave and fast. It doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin and you&#x27;ll always be satisfied with the shave. Although, still doesn&#x27;t give a close shave on the neck at all. I still end up using a razor for the neck. Oh well no big deal, I didn&#x27;t expect it to do a great job on the neck but with your face, it is just as close as a razor. It&#x27;s probably the best shaver on the market and I feel it is worth the money if you abandon the normal razor for fear of always getting cut. This shaver doesn&#x27;t give you any cuts so you won&#x27;t need to worry about shaving it too hard. I have sensitive skin so I would know about the problems with shaving. Anyway, I recommend it if you have the money to spend.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical when I received this Braun shaver as a gift but realized soon after how great this shaver is.  The shaver cuts relatively close (you&#x27;ll never get a shave closer than using a blade) but overall an excellent shave.    The key to this shaver is the cleaning system which keeps the shaver in brand new condition at all times.  The base unit will always inform you how clean or dirty the shaver it and will light up when you need to put it through the Braun cleaning process.    You do have to replace the cleaning fluid every 3 months but this is pretty inexpensive (if you buy through Amazon).    I used to use a wet dry shaver from Norelco for years (to get the closest shave possible and other dry shavers used to irritate my skin).  Now I can&#x27;t live without my Braun.  B/c of the cleaning system, I don&#x27;t even use aftershave anymore....which is a great tradeoff.</li>
    <li> I have owned Braun Shavers before and have been impressed with their quality.  This model is a lemon.  After owning it just two months, the shaver head lock just fell off.  This piece is plastic and is very cheap.  The shaver was never dropped or abused.  When you shaver breaks under the warranty period, you must ship it off to a service center (good luck finding one in your area) and wait 4-8 weeks for it to fixed and returned. This shaver cost almost 300 hundred dollars and Braun should be ashamed to have put their name on such a cheap product.</li>
    <li> Closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had from an electric shaver. It&#x27;s relatively quiet and the self cleaning is convenient. Unfortunately around my throat I have to pass over the area many times to get the hairs cut. Overall though best electric I&#x27;ve ever had and comes very close to shaving with a blade.</li>
    <li> I have been a long time Braun electric razor fan and I have replaced many heads on my 7 year old model. However it seemed to be getting much noiser and I decided it was time for a new one. The Braun Series 7 does a great job for me. Gives me a very close shave for an electric razor and is much quieter than the old model. Cleaning is also quieter and faster. Very satisfied with this product!</li>
    <li> Not sure what else i can add to the title. Simply put, this shaver does indeed rule. I can&#x27;t speak to you guys with the brawny man type beards. But, for a guy like myself who needs to shave every other day it is simply fantastic. As mentioned I don&#x27;t have a really thick beard but, I have a mole underneath my lower lip which prohibits me using a manual razor in that area. Previously I was using a manual for a good portion of my face and a Panasonic foil in the mole area. This was a HUGE hassle but, no electric I had used to this point allowed me to do away with the manual razors. They always chewed up my flesh and and left hairs behind and the shave wasn&#x27;t that close. Hey, I may not have to shave every day but, I do want a close shave. Hence the reason i had to use both...      Enter the 790cc. It has changed everything. No more manual razors. No more shaving creams and gels. Shaves me great every time and shaves close. I have a hard time telling the difference between this Braun and a manual and cream. As far as cost- yes it is a bit expensive but, you get what you pay for I suppose and it wasn&#x27;t that much more than the Panasonic I have now collecting dust. I love the clean and renew feature and can understand why some may feel it expensive but, in reality- it is worth it.     From my experience there wasn&#x27;t really much of an \\&quot;adaptation\\&quot; period. This may be due to the fact that I had already had experience with a foil though. Again- shaves me close, love the cleaning system, gets all the little hairs on my particular neck, does NOT chew up my face like a cheese grater.     I have found that Braun&#x27;s instructions regarding shaving before you shower to be spot on.      ------------------UPDATE--------------------------    Ok after having had the shaver a little longer now I just wanted to do a quick update. I still feel it&#x27;s an incredible razor and for those that aren&#x27;t happy with it I&#x27;m not sure what the issue is? Maybe some have brawny man beards and are expecting this to cut through their face fros like a straight razor? Or maybe they are not used to it yet. not sure and no offense to anyone we&#x27;re all different but, anyhow.    So here are my observations:    I listed above that Braun&#x27;s instructions about shaving before a shower to be spot on and they are - for most people. I found after awhile that shaving first and then getting into a hot shower sort of irritated my skin a bit personally- kind of burned a bit. This may vary depending on the individual and their skin type. So I decided to do a little experiment- Shower first and let my face fully dry while I got dressed/ made coffee/ whatever then shave. I found this to be the best method for me. It still shaves as well and possibly even better than the pre-shower method and I get absolutely no irritation. My skin is a bit oily naturally so I have no issues with \\&quot;natural lube\\&quot;.     At first I found myself mashing the shaver against my flesh for whatever reason. Must have been because of the Panasonic I had before and the fact that I could only get decent results by mashing it hard against my skin. I now have learned to let it glide across my flesh and get even better and faster results.    In regards to the cleaning solution. As I&#x27;ve already mentioned- I only need to shave once every other day and that is the regiment that I follow. I do use the cleaning base after every shave. It has now been roughly 6 weeks since I&#x27;ve owned the shaver and my read out on the display base still shows my fluid level at \\&quot;HIGH\\&quot;. So, again this may be dependent on the person and how much stubble thye&#x27;ve collected. One thing I do after every other shave is just remove the foil and tap out the stubble into the sink. Not sure if this has any effect but, that&#x27;s what I do. When I pop the shaver into the base after each shave and allow it to auto select the cleaning that the razor needs it has always selected \\&quot;ECO\\&quot; mode. As another experiment on one occassion I did not clean it until after 2 shaves. When I popped it into the base auto select went to \\&quot;NORMAL\\&quot; mode. So i beleive it is all working correctly.    On a side note to that- you can get the cleaning cartridges here on Amazon in either 2 or 3 packs. Pay close attention to the pricing on them. Sometimes it is only a dollar or 2 more to get 2- 2 packs (total of 4 cartridges) then it is to get 1- 3 pack. And other times it&#x27;s cheaper to get 1- 3 pack vs. 2-2 packs.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a present for my husband.  It is quite nice, but broke after 1 month of use (the &#x27;lock&#x27; button snapped off).  If you, like me, like to order from Amazon for the quick shopping &amp; ease in return, you will have better luck going to your local department store to pick this up.  Because of a tiny cartridge of cleaner, this only ships via ground package AND they will not allow you to return this.  The latter is a BIG problem when a $200 razor breaks.  I&#x27;m disappointed that Amazon has not seemed to figure out that if the cleaner cartridge is not being returned that there is no issue with this being shipped.  It seems very idiotic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned four different Braun shavers up to date.  All of my older Braun shavers still work great but I replace them with a new shaver about every two to three years.  Each newer model I purchase works even better.  Prior to purchasing this new model, I had a difficult time getting a close shave when shaving daily, but if I were to let it grow for about three or four days, the shaver was able to grab better resulting in a closer shave.  I no longer have to wait three days to get a close shave.    With this new Series 7 Braun shaver, I have been shaving daily with a much closer shave than my older model.  I am completely satisfied with this shaver!  I&#x27;ve dropped my older Braun shavers many times and accidentally submerged them in water a couple of times and yet they all still work.  I hope this one will be just as sturdy in the long run.</li>
    <li> Love it! Worth a few extra bucks for something you will use daily for years.</li>
    <li> I previously owned a Braun 8595, which was the best shaver I&#x27;d ever owned. I replaced it because the battery seemed to be dying. After using the Series 7 790cc Model 5671 for 2 months, it stills pulls a whisker or two every time I use it. I&#x27;m replacing it with a Series 5, in the hope that the \\&quot;Pulsonic\\&quot; or \\&quot;Flexing head\\&quot; feature is the problem, and that the Series 5 performs as well as the 8595. Whisker-pulling was the reason, decades ago, that I was never able to use a Norelco.</li>
    <li> It was a gift and feedback is excellent from family user. NO razor burn at all, close shave, very comfortable.</li>
    <li> Purchased the 760cc at first before I discovered the 790cc so I returned the 760cc. I liked how you can actually see when you need to clean it and charge it. Take my word, THIS IS THE BEST SHAVER ON THE MARKET!!!!!! If you are a first time shaver buyer this is for you, it also comes with a 60 day money back policy so if any reason you are not happy just send it back to braun and they will give you 100% of your money back</li>
    <li> I have owned 5 or 6 electric razors in my 66 years and this is by far the best yet. My last razor was a BrAun 7650 and this one has the old one bet by far !!  The cleaning station for this new one is designed much better than the earlier ones and appears that it should last longer. The cleaning station on the old 7650 broke and after reading the reviews I decided to get this new Pulsonic Series 7 790 cc rather than purchasing a new cleaning station for the BrAun 7650.</li>
    <li> Closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had from an electric shaver, but still not as close as a blade.  A couple of minor nit-picks: has a huge plug that sticks way out from the wall, and replacement cleaning cartridges are a little messy (you have to be careful when opening the new cartridge as well as inserting / removing from the base) as well as expensive, even on subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the earlier model 9595 for about a year. Lock switch broke off, so I purchased a Panasonic ES93LA-K. Great shaver but, losey cleaner/charger system. Both the bright blue LCD panel on the shaver and the LED lights on the \\&quot;clean/dry\\&quot; button continue to blink every 2 seconds after cycle is completed. At night the bathroom looked like an old disco hall. Very annoying. Panasonic advised shaver should blink, base should not and it&#x27;s a \\&quot;malfunction\\&quot;. Returned it and replaced it with another one which did the same thing. Panasonic again advised that continued use could possibly damage both the shaver and base unit. I&#x27;ve returned the 2nd one and am done with Panasonic and am planning on buying the 7-790cc which is the newer version of the 9595 which is a great shaver but would like to use the lock for upper lip. While the Panasonic ES-93 is a very good shaver, the Braun is equally as good and the entire shaver and base unit operation is far superior and easier to use. I&#x27;ll stick with Braun.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Braun Shaver directly from Amazon more than a year ago. It came with a 2-Year Warranty. A few months after I began using it I noticed that the cleaning base and the shaver were defective. I tried contacting Braun customer service on April or May 2009 so that I could send my shaver for repair or replacement. However, it was extremely hard to get a hold of them. They finally answered one of my emails yesterday, which was September 22nd, 2010.     I DON&#x27;T RECOMMEND anyone to purchase Braun products. I&#x27;m surprised Amazon is selling Braun products since Braun has such horrible service.</li>
    <li> I bought this new Pulsonic Series 7790cc because my previous model Razor from Braun Series 8     had problems with two of them within a year.  this model shaves close and comfortable and had no pull on the longer hairs.  this model is also easier to clean. expensive, yes but there are NO free lunches out there.  Fast shipping from Amazon.com</li>
    <li> I have had this shaver for almost four years now, after previously using a Norelco, a Remington, a Panasonic, and a different Braun over the preceding 20 years.  It costs more than most razors, but the price difference is more than worth it.  It gives a closer shave, in about 2/3 the time, with less discomfort.  If it lasts me 8 years (which would be my guess since it&#x27;s still going strong), and I use it ~300 times per year, that&#x27;s 2400 shaves.  If it costs $100 more than the alternative shaver, that&#x27;s an extra 4 cents per shave.</li>
    <li> This is everything I wanted in a shaver. The Braun Series 7 looks sleek, and gives an amazingly close shave. Easy to carry in it&#x27;s case. Charges very quickly, and easy to hand wash. However, I don&#x27;t clean it with the solution every time the hygene bars go down, I find it to be pricey to buy it that frequently.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed when my husband found out that this is NOT a wet-dry shaver, when he reads the instructions.  I thought this is a wet-dry model since the reviews say it is the best on the market.  Maybe in the product description should mention this is not a wet-dry model.  Anyway, luckily the seller is great that they gave us the full refund of the product (we did not use it).   Five star for the seller, three star for the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been more disappointed in a big brand item!  My husband had used it about 6 times when it started to rattle and shake like a #10 on the Richter Scale.  We thought perhaps the head was broken because it ran fine with the head off.  So. . . we put out more big bucks and bought a new head for the already new razor.  Same thing.  I could find no one who could fix it.  I finally sent it to a manufacturer who promptly returned it without even looking.  Finally I found an address for the \\&quot;big cheese\\&quot; mother company and sent it there.  After hearing nothing for nearly 8 months, I got a letter saying that they were sorry and if I sent a mailing address (not po box as was on return label) they would send me a new razor.  Haven&#x27;t heard from them again!!!!!!!!  It&#x27;s been well over 6 months.  A lesson well learned about Braun products. . . don&#x27;t buy any more!</li>
    <li> All I have to say is if you have a baby face you will love this thing! If you have a very thick beard like myself this thing could be your worst nightmare. It takes a while to get used to and you cannot switch between blade and electric. If also takes a while to shave and if you have a very think beard it will not be as close as a blade and will leave hairs behind. So if you have a very thick beard then this shaver is not for you!</li>
    <li> I have tried lots of different shaving systems. This is not one of the greatest. It is not uncommon for this shaver to irritate my skin. The shave is not all that close. And it is not the huge time saver I thought it would be.  I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have used this razor for over a year. It is my third Braun. It shaves ok, about a good as any other Braun, but when they redesigned their shavers from the previous generation, they relocated the pop out trimmer. Every now and then, I trim the back of my neck using a hand held mirror. The way they positioned the trimmer, you can&#x27;t see where you are trimming because the body of the razor blocks the view of the trimmer head. It may sound like a trivial thing, but it is actually a huge pain. I had to buy a separate trimmer as a result. Bad design on a pretty good, but pricy shaver.</li>
    <li> I bought it because of all of the good things I read here and I am in agreement: Good investment.    My old Braun was still running strong but I was pretty much \\&quot;sanding\\&quot; off my beard, it seemed.    My only tip concerns the cleaning fluid: I stuff a plastic bag in the opening in the cleaner&#x27;s top between cleanings. I expect that will solve the evaporation issue. Use cleaner once a week, not daily, but I did pop for the replacement 3-pak. Hope it lasts a year.</li>
    <li> While the shave is very good, and I like the cleaning system, Beware that this is a very noisy unit both while shaving and while cleaning.</li>
    <li> Over the last 30 years I have owned three Braun Electric Shavers.  I run them into the ground, and have replaced motors and batteries to keep the last one going beyond its natural life.    This Braun is the best so far.  It is ergonomic beyond the older models.  I would match it with a custom shave from a very good barber, complete swith hot towels!  Shop around, or let Amazon shop around for you.  You might find some better deals, but grey market products are out there.    If I had to replace this razor for some immediate reason (Like lost with luggage) I would buy another,  If I were buying a razor for someone I really liked, this would be the one.    I have very bad advanced arthritis - typing is difficult and my right wrist is frozen with a pin inside, so shaving right handed, as I normally do, is a challenge for the razor.  The Braun does this fine.    I cannot speak to the long term mechanical reliability, but if it is at all like my two other Brauns I will use it a long time.    I am retired, and I do not have a lot of disposable income.  A purchase like this one is a decision that gets a lot of thought and planning.  But I have no regrets or buyers remorse.    Anyone who is buying a shaver as a gift, who can afford this upscale model, cannot miss with this one![[ASIN:B000Q6SU3C Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic  Shaver]]</li>
    <li> Picked this up locally last night since I knew there was a chance I wouldn&#x27;t like it and returning it would be easier that way.  Had about 3 days of facial hair growth at the time.  I tend to shave about every three days with my Gillette Fusion Power razor to prevent looking like I got in a fight with 6 wolverines in a paper bag, so this was a fairly apples-to-apples comparison.  My goal was to find a shaving tool that would allow me to shave EVERY day.  I figured it wouldn&#x27;t be AS close as a razor, but it had to at least cut all the hairs and not let it look like I needed a shave when done.  I followed the directions to the letter and was suprised how quickly I had a full charge.  So, no washing of the face before, as instructed in the manual.  I started shaving near my jawline by the sideburns and ear.  Then I realized that I had some electric shaver pre-shave stuff and slapped some of that on.  That did it&#x27;s usual job of lubricating my face and making the whiskers stand up from my face.  I found that I had to go over every part of my face between 5-10 times to do a reasonable job and still had more than just a couple hairs that were still not cut.  I tried using the \\&quot;LOCK\\&quot; button and shaving at an angle and it didn&#x27;t help at all.  So, I&#x27;d say the performance was \\&quot;passable\\&quot; at the cheeks and jawline.  That being said, the performance on the neck was abysmal.  Even running over the same area at multiple angles left tons of hairs no matter what I did.  I shaved against the grain, as instructed... which didn&#x27;t help.  Needless to say, this sucker is going back and I will stick with my Fusion Power and shaving every three days for now.  It&#x27;s a shame that I got a similar shaving experience with my Braun foil shaver in 1990 as I got with this ~$300 tool in 2009.  Your mileage may vary.</li>
    <li> He upgraded from a 3 Series and despite a little skepticism is now converted. I&#x27;m still surprised. Beware it&#x27;s not a small contraption.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with electric shavers ever since I started to shave. Over the years I have owned Remington shavers, Norelco shavers, and various Braun shavers. This is by far the best shaver I have ever used. I purchased it on Amazon on 8-21-09 and have used it almost every day since it arrived, and I have gotten the closest, most comfortable shaves with it. I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I like this shaver. It works great, very smooth, delicate, and friendly to skin. I can now shave above my throat smoothly. My skin is sensitive and used to get red after shaving, but with this Braun I just feel comfortable. I like it very much. Finally don&#x27;t forget to buy it only on Amazon, &#x27;cause it has an incredibly amazing customer service, as well as reasonable prices. I received it pretty fast too. Thanks Braun for the good product &amp; thanks Amazon for the perfect service!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver several months ago, and decided to provide my review after using it almost daily during that period.  This is a lengthy review.    History  I&#x27;ve been a manual razor user since I began shaving, but I did dabble in various electric razors.  I received an expensive rotary electric razor as a gift but found it missed too many hairs, eventually returning to a manual razor.  During my Army days, I purchased a cheap (under twenty dollars) foil razor, which worked surprisingly well during those field training exercises when I didn&#x27;t bring my usual manual razor.  I learned that the foil razors shaved my face better than the rotary version; this experience influenced my decision to later buy this foil razor.  So, many years went by, but I still favored my manual (multi-blade) razor with grocery store shaving cream.  I developed an interest in wet shaving using the old-fashioned double-edge (DE) safety razors, with a high-quality shaving cream and badger brush.  Although it&#x27;s more time consuming, DE shaving is my favorite; it provides me with the absolute closest shave possible.  Unfortunately, I developed a skin condition on my face called rosacea, which is basically a red, painful swelling, which can be aggravated by daily shaving with a blade.  I visited my physician, who not only prescribed a gel called Metrogel but also recommended I switch to an electric razor.  He warned me that many guys accustomed to shaving with a manual razor, may be disappointed with electric razors since they don&#x27;t shave as close as a blade.    Experience  I know I want a foil (versus rotary) shaver because of my prior experience.  Since the new shaver would become my primary tool, I want a high quality item that provides the closest shave an electric razor can provide.  After a much searching, I settled on the Braun brand, and after more research, settled on their top-of-line model, 790cc.  Here&#x27;s what I like, in no particular order:    1.  Heavy (but not too heavy).  It feels good in the hand.  2.  Powerful.  It cuts through whiskers (even several days&#x27; worth of growth) without hesitation.  3.  No pinching.  I find that cheaper razors can cause razor burn or painful pinching.  4.  Cleaning options.  Basically, there are a couple of ways to do this.  One is to use the included base station.  Drop the unit in, and press the button.  It cleans and recharges the razor and comes out smelling \\&quot;lemony\\&quot; afterwards.  Some reviewers feel this is a scam by Braun to generate more revenue by selling refills for the base station.  My experience is that refills are required about every 5 weeks or so with daily use.  Replacements are about six dollars, and I don&#x27;t mind paying for the convenience.  However, the directions state that the razor can be cleaned by running under water and periodically putting a little machine oil on the cutting block.  5.  Travels well.  I use this on short trips (&lt; 5 days).  Fully charged, the unit lasts approximately for 5 days.  If necessary, the power cord can be detached from the base station and taken for longer trips.  If the unit is no longer charged, it can be used with the power cord plugged in.  The travel case is sturdy and holds up fine in my carry on (by the way, I&#x27;ve had no trouble taking this unit through airport security check points (just to be clear, I never take the base station with me, but leave that at home).  6.  It doesn&#x27;t heat up.  Cheaper razors tend to get quite warm after being on for a while.  This doesn&#x27;t do that.  7.  Side-burn trimmer.  OK, this is not great, but it&#x27;s pretty good.  Sometime I&#x27;ll whip out my DE razor to get a perfect side-burn trim.  8.  Battery/Hygiene indicator.  The battery indicator is nice to have, especially when traveling.  The hygiene indicator is interesting, but I just drop the unit the base station after each use and clean it, so I don&#x27;t pay much attention to that piece of it.  9.  Shave quality.  I saved this for last.  The shave quality is phenomenal, but it doesn&#x27;t start off that way.  It takes time (a couple of weeks) for the face to become accustomed to the razor.  The shave will improve as (1) your face adjusts, and (2) your technique improves.  Technique is really a function of the way you adjust to the many directions of whisker growth.  Be sure to shave against the grain.  Also, if you&#x27;re moving from a manual razor to this one, do not alternate during this transition period.  You&#x27;ll just prolong the adjustment period.  This razor it not designed to be use on a wet face.  Face should be clean and dry.  I usually wash my face, dry it throughly, and apply an electric pre-shave solution.  Although an electric pre-shave solution is not required, I find that it helps immensely in getting a really close shave (virtually as close as a manual razor).  Although this is a little off topic, I will emphasize that a pre-shave solution helps tremendously.  My favorite is Lab Series (unscented), while my second favorite is Anthony (lightly scented).  I&#x27;ve used Williams Lectric Shave, and although it works great, the smell is too strong for me.    A couple more points  1.  Some people recommend refilling the cleaning solution holder with rubbing alcohol, in an attempt to save money.  These aren&#x27;t designed to be refilled.  More importantly, the cleaning solution appears to contain some sort of lubricant (in addition to alcohol and a lemon scent).  This is obvious if you dip your finger in the solution and rub your fingers together.  If you&#x27;re going to spend two hundred or more dollars on this razor, follow the directions and either (1) use the base station with appropriate cleaning solution refills, or (2) don&#x27;t use the base station and instead rinse the unit per the instructions.  2.   As your face adjusts and your technique improves, you&#x27;ll notice your shaves improving to a point where they&#x27;re almost as close as a manual razor.  It took me several months to realize the importance of using a good electric pre-shave solution.    Summary  Although it&#x27;s expensive, it&#x27;s a wonderful product.  My rosacea is under control, my shaves are close (almost as close as a blade), and it takes me significantly less time to shave in the morning.  My shaves are close enough that I don&#x27;t need to do any touch-up shaving later in the day.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is my third shaver and by far the best for my sensitive skin. It took me a year to decide on a shaver of this price and it has proved to be well worth it.</li>
    <li> Really wondered how a shave could be worth that much money more than my Norelco triple head rotary.  Now I understand that it is.  Shaves better than a blade on me and my face was already plenty tough enough from the Norelco.  Only takes about a third as long to do a job properly, while cheaper razor left uncut stubble here and there, especially on neck.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review but this razor deserves one.  I&#x27;ve always used the Norelco&#x27;s (top of the line models) because I just didn&#x27;t see that a foil razor could do a better job than a rotary one.  Well, I was dead wrong.  The Series 7 shaves so much closer than my Norelco it isn&#x27;t even close.  I&#x27;m 47 years old and have used Norelco&#x27;s for about 25 years but I will never go back after using the Braun.  It is louder than my Norelco but it just performs better and the cleaning station works great.  And it is very fast, pretty much one or two passes and you&#x27;re done.  I&#x27;m glad I spent the money; yes it is expensive but totally worth it in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I had the braun activator, which did ok.  This is in a whole new league.  I have very sensitive skin and recommend this product to anyone who has issues with shaving.  For those who can&#x27;t use cheap razors, this is a must-buy!</li>
    <li> Like many others I&#x27;m sure, I read many reviews here before deciding whether to order. I&#x27;ve used a Philips/Norelco rotary shaver primarily for at least a decade. But I always use a safety razor (quattro or similar) when I need a really close shave because I never got it with the rotary.  When a hotel cleaning staff walked off with my previous rotary shaver, I had no choice but to buy new. I&#x27;m very glad I did. I am a skeptic by nature and I expected some level of disappointment given my previous experience with electric shavers. But following the recommendations to shave before I wash my face and by going over areas a couple of times, I have gotten a very close shave. When I run my hand over my face against the beard growth following shaving with my new Braun, it&#x27;s very close to how it is after I shave with a safety razor. I never got this close with the rotary even when the rotary cutters are brand new and clean.  I&#x27;m a convert.</li>
    <li> the one-button quick cleaning is awesome, totally hassle-free even you always forget to clean after each shave</li>
    <li> I have used electric shavers on and off throughout my life and I was always disappointed in my purchases after a few weeks so, ultimately, I found the Fusion blade and was exceptionally happy using it for shaving.  However, I decided to go bald recently and did not enjoy the constant razor burn I got from shaving my head with a razor.  Along comes the Braun Series 7 Pulsonic miracle and I am happy to say that I can keep my head as close shaved as a new born baby&#x27;s behind without great effort.  The closeness of the shave on my face and my head is unbelievable!  I have never gotten this close a shave from any electric shaver or any razor.  I recommend this shaver despite the price tag because, after all, aren&#x27;t we worth it?</li>
    <li> YOU CANNOT RETURN THIS SHAVER TO AMAZON FOR ANY REASON!  Braun Series 7 Shaver.  I like Amazon and am a frequent buyer from this website and I will continue to buy from Amazon -- but not products you can&#x27;t return.  This shaver was given to me for a Christmas gift.  I wanted to return it and the Amazon rep pointed out that because it has a FLAMMABLE cleaning cartridge they will not accept a return and she said it is stated clearly on the website.  Well, it IS stated on the web page, but I would not say &#x27;clearly.&#x27;  It is in small print below the copy describing the shaver.  BUYER BEWARE.</li>
    <li> On the product: I personally did not buy this product for myself, but for my fiance. He had a different Braun razor before this and it was out of date. I bought this razor, because of the great reviews that it had on here and on other websites. My fiance is very picky so the razor that I got him had to great. I got this for him for Christmas and he loves it. He says that this razor has a clean shave even on his neck; which before was getting cut up. I know that if he loves this razor it really has to be a great razor. I did ask him if there is anything that he doesn&#x27;t like about it and he said that it is a little noisy, but really not that bad. I hope this helps someone. Thank you for reading.     On shipping: The razor was shipped quickly; which I was impressed with because it was around Christmas when I ordered it. The box with the razor in it arrived packed nicely and unharmed.</li>
    <li> I am 84 years of age and taking blood thinners.  As a result of this, I could no longer shave with a bladed razor.  I had purchased a Norelco three headed razor and was not at all satisfied with its ability to shave me down closely to my skin.  After a lot of searching on line, I purchased the Braun Series 7-790cc Pulsonic Razor and found that gave me a very good shave with a minimum of going back over my cheeks and chin to get a good shave.  In short, I am pleased with the performance of the razor.  However, I suddenly realized that the cleaning aspect involved the use of a flammable alcohol type cleaning fluid and I did not have a place to put the cleaning dock where it was in a spark free or gas stove free area. As a result, I am now using only the razor portion of the system and cleaning it by removing the head and running water through the head and the gear area of the razor. I have also purchased a replacement head to use if and when the present head needs replacement.  I am keeping the razor, find the cleaning aspect cumbersome and, possibly, dangerous as I live alone and am deaf when not using my hearing apparatus.  A really good buy if can use safely.</li>
    <li> I had an older model of the Clean &amp; Renew system, which I loved. Eventually, the power button broke and the unit would not turn off. My girlfriend got me this new one for Christmas at my behest, and I thought I&#x27;d love it.    Everything is fine with it except the most important part: The blades are very weak. It takes me over 2x longer to shave than it did with my old unit. The new blade system just doesn&#x27;t cut it. I have to shave daily no matter what, and I want something that&#x27;s going to cut quickly and efficiently. I must go over the same areas multiple times, and sometimes press hard to get it to cut like a $200 shaver should cut.    That said, I suppose if you have a light beard or thin hair, it might work for you. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, it&#x27;s not worth the money and I&#x27;d like mine (or hers) back. These blades are just plain awful.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the shaver!  He says that it took a couple of days for his beard to get used to the \\&quot;pulsation\\&quot; action of the shaver, that raises the hair more on its end, so to speak.  But now it shaves wonderfully close!</li>
    <li> I bought the Braun Series 7-790cc shaver with some reservations. Over the years I tried various other electric shavers with very disappointing results. Not so with the Braun 7. It shaves close, it does not miss hairs, it works better than I could of hoped. Bottom line is that everyone&#x27;s face (and hair) is different, but if you are considering an electric razor then you owe it to yourself to try this one out.</li>
    <li> i switched from the Norelco Arcitec and there is no comparison.  The Braun Series 7 shaves quicker and closer and is simply the best electric razor on the market.</li>
    <li> Recently the shaver began to stop running while shaving. By troubleshooting it I came to the conclusion that it would only run with a virtually fully charged battery, as indicated on the integrated battery meter. At or below the 80% charge level it would cut out. It&#x27;s still under warranty, so I sent it in for service with a complete and detailed explanation of the problem. Braun&#x27;s service center has just sent me an email stating that they found nothing wrong with it and are returning it to me without repair. Buyer&#x27;s be aware that at least in my experience Braun does not honor the warranty. It doesn&#x27;t take a rocket scientist to tell when something fails. And, I went to the time and expense to ship it to them. So, I guess their two possible excuses for calling it OK are either I&#x27;m an idiot and can&#x27;t tell when something quits working, or that I&#x27;m a liar. Even if they turned it on and it worked for a moment, there is no doubt that the \\&quot;symptoms\\&quot; I reported indicate a problem. A company with integrity would know what was most likely wrong and replace the likely defect part.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver because it was recommended to my by some friends. This is my first real dive into an electric shaver. I can say that if I work at it I can get a shave as close as my 3 blade razors. I do have to use multiple directions with the shaver and in some cases press pretty hard, but it will get the job done. I am glad that I don&#x27;t need to use a blade razor anymore. I would recommend this shaver to someone looking for an electric shaver..</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s father previously owned the earlier model of the electric shaver.  When it finally gave up the ghost, he really wanted another just like it.  He checked locally and found that the price offered at the local big box retailers was quite a bit higher than he originally paid when he purchased it at a special bulk buy rate from Sam&#x27;s Club.  My husband surfed the Internet and found that Amazon had the best deal - still not as cheap as the initial buy, but $70 less than locally.  Husband purchased it and had it delivered to Dad&#x27;s door.  Everybody is happy!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fianc&amp;eacute;e for his birthday back in May, and like many of you I reviewed what people thought because I like to know I&#x27;m getting what I pay for.. Well they were right, This Shaver rocks.. It gives him a nice close shave and he loves that it contours to the face and it comes with a cleaner. I&#x27;ll be getting one for my Dad on father&#x27;s day! Pricey but worth it!</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband - it looked great and I know he was not happy with the shaver he had - the blades seemed to dull so fast - He does NOT like it. I was going to get replacement cartridges but he told me not to bother - the problem he was having was not with the shaving performance - that seemed ok - his problem was the charger/cleaner - most of the time the shaver would not sit in the cradle right - in order for it to complete the cleaning cycle he had to hold it in place the entire time - almost seems like the shaver does not have enough weight to keep it situated right in the cradle - needless to say, he does not want to deal with that every day - he has coarse red hair and reviews the shaving capabilities so-so - will try to get with Braun to see if they can do anything</li>
    <li> After shaving for more than 40 years with a series of Norelco triple headed electric razors I decided to scan the Amazon reviews before purchasing my next electric razor, and noticed that most reviewers raved about the Braun series 7 (790cc). I had been happy with my Norelco razors, but since I have a heavy beard, and shave at least once per day, I decided to try the Braun series 7 (790cc) to see if I got a closer shave.   I didn&#x27;t.  I get a close shave from the Braun, but no better than the Norelco I used before it needed replacing.  After using the Braun for about one month I&#x27;ve decided the Norelco and Braun provide equally close shaves.  However, there are several features of the Braun that I dislike, and several features of the Norelco that I prefer.  1) The Norelco side-burn trimmer is easier to use than the Braun, which has an awkward, extended trimmer that seems poorly designed.  The Norelco trimmer is compact and has a larger cutting edge.   2) The Norelco indicates the battery remaining with an LED on the razor.  The Braun has to be placed in it&#x27;s cradle to see the charge remaining.  3) The Braun indicates whether the razor needs cleaning - which takes place by pressing the Clean cycle on the razor stand.  However, when I clean the razor under running water, dry it, and replace it in the stand, it still indicates it requires cleaning.  The indicator measures how \\&quot;often\\&quot; I shave, but not the actual \\&quot;need\\&quot; for cleaning.  If you want the razor to clean itself, and if you don&#x27;t mind purchasing a new cleaning cartridge every few months (or more, depending on how often you use the self-cleaner) the feature is worthwhile, but I don&#x27;t mind rinsing the razor every few days.  I also don&#x27;t like the smell of the cleaning solution - another reason to rinse with water.  4) The price of the Braun was more than the top of the line Norelco, primarily due to it&#x27;s self-cleaning capability that I won&#x27;t be using.  Since both razors provide close shaves, I recommend the Norelcoover the Braun.</li>
    <li> This was my first electric shaver, before I had always used the razor, but my skin is very sensitive and shaving every day was often an isssue. This shaver solved my problem!  However, the shave is not as deep as the one achieved with a razor, but it can get very close if one has time to catch the hair in the most difficult areas.  I would definitely buy it again (or ask it as a gift as i did!)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shaver for about six months now. Overall, I&#x27;m rather unsatisfied if the price and consumable costs are ignored, and very unsatisfied with the unit once these costs are considered. I&#x27;m willing to spend money if the unit works, but this one just doesn&#x27;t work as well as shavers at half the cost.    The shave quality - Fair at best. It shaves most whiskers pretty well, but those random thicker hairs just seem to avoid this shaver entirely. I can go over the same section of my face five times trying to get a single hair and this shaver just can&#x27;t get it. Why? It&#x27;s strange that the majority of my face feels clean shaven, but there are those stray whiskers that just refuse to allow this shaver to take them down. I REGULARLY break out my older (and much cheaper) shaver to clean up what this expensive shaver just can&#x27;t get. Why does my 4 year old shaver (also a Braun) with a one year old cutter work MUCH better than this relatively new unit?    The cleanup - The cleaning unit is a mixed bag. It&#x27;s nice to just drop it in and press a button, but it just seems stupid. It alwasy feels and smells clean and fresh, but those cartridges will cost you about $6 each and they only last for a month or two. After using it for a while, you may realize how silly it is and wish you had gotten a cheaper and more reasonable shaver. Cleaning an electric razor is almost a non-issue, so having this giant cleaning unit that consumes disposable cartriges is just stupid. What is the environmental cost of every man using this shaver and throwing away those used cartridges every 40-60 days?    Build quality - Pretty good. The shaver itself feels sturdy. The pop-up trimmer is awkward to use because of the angle it comes out at. The head shows significant wear already on the plastic areas because the cleaning fluid is eating away at it. How could they build a cleaning system that seems to slowly destroy the shaver itself?    My advice - look at other shavers. Braun makes some good products but this isn&#x27;t one of them.</li>
    <li> By far the best Braun to date! I have been a Braun shaver user for close to 25 years, and this is by far the best shaver they have produced. The closeness of the shave and the ease of cleaning and maintaining the optimal performance is first class. Given the cost of replacement foil cassettes, using the system and cleaning will extend the usefulness and effectiveness of the shaver. Highly recommended to anyone wanting a great shave.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever had. A clean, easy, quick shave.  I&#x27;ve used various brands over the last 40 years and this was an eye opener. A little expensive compared to other brands but well worth it. It&#x27;s false economy to scrimp on a product you use nearly every day of a man&#x27;s life.</li>
    <li> Like most reviewers, I did a lot of research before spending the money on a razor like this one.  To be honest, I was really hesitant to shell out this kind of money.  In the past, I&#x27;ve purchased your typical \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; electric razor.  So...after the research and not finding a razor with better feedback, I broke down and purchased the Braun Series 7-790cc.  When I first used it, although it left a very close shave (not as close as a razor but better than any other electric razor) I was getting razor burn or at least that&#x27;s what I thought it was.  After reading the manual, it states that it can take up to 3 weeks before your skin adjusts to the new razor.  I toughed it out and boy am I glad I did!  About a week and a half after using my new razor the burns went away.  I&#x27;m extrememely happy I made this purchase and definitely suggest this razor to anyone looking to upgrade.  One helpful tip...the replacement cartridge for the cleaning fluid runs about $15 for 3 units.  To combat this cost, I only clean the razor every 3 days.  Days 1 &amp; 2 simply clean it with running water.  This make the cleaning cartridge last approx. 3 months.  Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I recently graduated from college and began shaving every morning for work for the first time in my life. Ive always had good but sensitive skin but shaving every morning took its toll and i started to develop acne around my jaw line. I bought this guy and within two weeks my skin is almost clear again.     i dont understand how people complain about this thing. Skin feels great, shave is close, and there isnt any razor burn or issues at all.     BUY IT</li>
    <li> Just got this in the mail and really pleased. I have not purchased a shaver in over 15yrs and did a lot of research before buying again. Glad I got this one!! Shave is extremely close and I would recommend to others who are looking for a new shaver. The only thing I do not care to much for is having to purchase the cleaning fluid modules but I guess it is worth it since I do not have to clean it myself. I work and live in Germany and will be going on vacation to Rome for 10 days next month. I will see how well it operates away from the main unit.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd Braun shaver.  I have also used Norelco shavers.  This is the best shaver I have used thus far.  It is worth the extra cost.  One note - the instructions indicate to get a good shave to do so before washing one&#x27;s face.  I disagree.  I have found it best to shower first and then apply a solution of Williams pre electric shave.  Much better.</li>
    <li> There are only three reasons to buy an electric razor: save on blades, save time from buying blades or to avoid getting cut while shaving.  Other than that blades, or manual shaving are superior--no one would argue that you can get as close as shave with an electric.  The only thing they might say is \\&quot;it is close to a blade.\\&quot;    With that said, I ordered the Braun 790.  The thing has a whole lot of items to it and things you must buy to keep it going.  Unlike the Braun of old when it actually was a German company which specialized in practicality and didn&#x27;t try to milk customers into buying unnecessary things, Proctor &amp; Gamble (the maker of Tide and Crest) bought them out and changed the game.  Now you need to have this nasty alcohol solution cleaner--which must be repurchased every thirty days--in order to use your shaver.  In the past Braun was designed to be cleaned with water and a brush.  Furthermore, you need to replace the cutting block every year and a half for about forty bucks.  So any money you might have saved by not having to buy blades is eaten up by Proctor &amp; Gamble&#x27;s desire to milk as much money as it can from you!    Within a year and a half you will have spent nearly $400 to buy and maintain this razor--which will never shave as close as a blade and takes twice as long to shave as a blade.  And unlike Panasonic which allows for shaving under water, Braun must be used dry which reduces lubrication and the closeness of the shave.  All in all a raw deal, and therefore I am returning my Braun and realize the only thing this razor will help you get rid of is a lot of your money!</li>
    <li> Until they make a newer model (oops, too late), this is the best you can get. I would assume this is all true for the slightly update model as well.    Reasons you want this:    1. Cleaning: It really does clean itself that well and I don&#x27;t think the premium of cartridges is that bad. For less than $10 a month, you spend less time cleaning and your face gets fewer blemishes from all those friendly bacteria that would otherwise nest on the razor between uses.    2. Shave quality: If you use it every day, expect the the best. I don&#x27;t use a regular razor, not ever, so I&#x27;m not comparing. But I&#x27;ve owned several electric razors and even after months of use, this thing beats out all my past razors by a long shot.     3. Shave speed: I didn&#x27;t expect to notice a change, but the speed claims are actually true. I take about half as long to shave now.    Issues:    1. Long hair &#x3D; pain: If you wait a couple days to shave, I&#x27;ve found that this model is a bit unforgiving. It takes forever to get done and as you shave, it occasionally grabs a hair, painfully. It doesn&#x27;t yank it out, it just catches it rather strongly. So I&#x27;ve resolved to shave every day and if I go on vacation, I first use the little side trimmer to chop things down before I use the main blade.    2. Cartridge confusion?: I had different experiences than others with the cleaning cartridges (which you don&#x27;t *have* to use). For me, it didn&#x27;t want to change the cartridge after 6 weeks of daily usage. I felt that it wasn&#x27;t getting as clean as it should and then the &#x27;replace soon&#x27; light came on. I decided to change the cartridge &#x27;early&#x27; and after the next cleaning I noticed a bit difference. Maybe the replacement light is based on the level of the solution. This is obviously easy to fix - I&#x27;ll just replace the cartridge every month regardless of the little lights.    Minor note:    For traveling purposes, I found the case to be a little annoying - it doesn&#x27;t want to close unless you get it in there just right and it&#x27;s hard to tell where just right is. However, the case does work right and tends to stay closed and keep the unit safe, so that&#x27;s fine. A minor issue as well if you travel for long periods - the cord for the cleaning unit is the same one you&#x27;d use to charge it without the cleaning unit, so you&#x27;ll have to unplug it and pack it separate or purchase another separately. For me, I manage to get by on a single charge while I&#x27;m gone for a week or two.    Last words:    Although the price was a bit much to get me to buy, I was very happy with it. It&#x27;s one of those things that when I use it each morning I&#x27;m glad that I convinced myself that it was a &#x27;necessary&#x27; purchase :)</li>
    <li> I have used Braun shavers for about 20 years now. I began primarily to reduce skin irritation, which it does. My new Braun shaver is a replacement for my 5 series (lasted about 4 1/2 years of daily use), so my experience can only be to compare to other older Braun&#x27;s.     The Shave is the closest is have ever had from an electric shaver. Very little need to go over same area repeatedly, like in past with other shavers. I can pick up the razor in in about 1 1/2 minutes get a shave good enough for the professional work environment.     The clean up continues to be exceptionally easy with use of the cleaning base.  My previous two shavers had this base, and it alone could be used to justify the use of and electric shaver. About once a month, I open the shaving head to brush extra debris from the head of the shaver (just like in previous models). It is a little more difficult with this model due to the complexity of the shaving  head.    This is by far the most expensive shaver that I have ever bought. Although, it gives the best shave that i have ever had, with the exception of hot lather and straight razor from a barber.  However, I have had poor customer service in the past from Braun (with another model) and given that it only has a 1 year warranty, it this reason that i give it 4 stars. If it gives me trouble free service for the next 4 years, it would then easily justify 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Shaves good except the fact that in some areas to have a very clean shave I would still use razor blades. Nevertheless it is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned. I used to use razor blades exclusively because I just could&#x27;t find a good electrical shaver</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun shavers for over 7 years now.  The last one was terrific and gave me a close shave every time.  The cleaning station left the shaver feeling like new every time.  This one lacks in comparison.  The shaver took some getting used to, like all shavers do, but I still feel like the other one got me a closer shave and less irritated.    My biggest gripe is the new cleaning station.  Yeah, it looks cool, but it does not do it&#x27;s job. After a clean, when you pull out the shaver, you&#x27;ll notice the dock is covered with hair gunk/residue.  It&#x27;s like its not properly draining into the cleaner cartridge.    Braun needs to go back to selling their older models, the new ones are terrible.  I think it&#x27;s time for me to find a new brand of shavers.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t cheap, but this foil shaver will get you very close to a traditional blade shave without the cuts and burns.  It absolutely leaves other mechanical shavers in the dust.  The included trimmer and cleaning system is icing on the cake.    In addition to the close shave, what I really like about the shaver is it does not get hot to the touch when extended shaving on difficult beards like mine.  This helps reduce both irritation and in-grown hairs.    What is surprising about this shaver is that is also gives a great shave on your scalp too.  If you are bald and like to a have a smooth look on top, this shaver is simply amazing in it&#x27;s closeness and ease - and no skin irritation there either.      So far, in the several months I&#x27;ve owned mine, it has been very reliable.</li>
    <li> I have razor bumps all over my skin and I expected miracles from Pulsonic. Well, it didn&#x27;t solve my problem. But, it is still better than my 3-year old Braun. It is more quiet and gives a closer shave with less effort.</li>
    <li> Like all Braun products, excellent as far as performance goes; I found though that the instruction manual was not very explicit, and the shaver case was downright tacky!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a month and so far I am quite satisfied with this shaver. From the indicators a fully charged shaver can last me longer than a week and that is good when you travel short periods and dont want to carry the chord. noise level is lower than the one Braun I just replaced. That one is about 8 years old and still in good working condition. As a customer I just don&#x27;t appreciate the expensive replacement cost of the head, the cutters or the liquid cleaning solution. They should be a lot cheaper since they already charged the shaver as much as they do. Also I shouldn&#x27;t have to clean it so often with the liquid cleaner as the indicators demand. Once a week for that kind of cleaning should suffice!!!</li>
    <li> I have used electric razors for virtually all my adult life. I change razors every one to two years. I tend to buy the top of the line simply hoping that it saves me precious time in R&amp;D about the products.    The previous one I owned was a Panasonic (their top of the line). When Braun came out, the one feature that I really liked was that you can shave with the cord even when the battery is drained. With Panasonic, you have to wait for the battery to charge.    However, despite the nice looks and OK shave, I think the Panasonic was better.     Braun&#x27;s Pulsonic doesn&#x27;t seem as close.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Braun Pulsonic specifically to own a high end electric shaver.  I have owned both rotary and foil shavers.  I prefer the closer shave of the foil shaver over the rotary.  I ordered the Pulsonic based on the reviews of others stating that it was the best.  I was not disappointed when I received the shaver.  It shaves closer and with fewer passes than any other electric shaver I have used.  It also glides over my skin more smoothly than any other shaver I have used.  It certainly lives up to the old adage, \\&quot;You get what you pay for.\\&quot;  My only concern with the shaver is a problem that I have had with all other shavers.  My beard is very tough, and I will need to replace the cutting heads before the recommended service interval.</li>
    <li> EXCELLANT SHAVER.  THE BEST THEY HAVE PRODUCED SO FAR.  HAD BEEN USING THEIR PREVIOUS TOP OF THE LINE BUT THIS ONE IS CERTAINTLY BETTER.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this shaver for 2 years. He has tried other electric razors, along with shaving with a disposable razor. We spent a little more on this Braun, knowing it would be good quality (usually we go the cheap route and deal with what we get!). He has only replaced the blade once. The automatic washing feature has been very handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have found that when it is fully charged, it will last through several uses, so he can take it on a business trip without worrying about bringing the whole charging station. The cleaning solution also lasts through several washes. He can shave every day without irritation, or he can shave a couple of times a week and get the same results. He likes that it is easy to use and easy to clean. He gets a clean, close shave in a short amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little loud, especially when it&#x27;s being cleaned in the cleaning station, but that&#x27;s not enough to make us want a different brand!</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver on the market period. This is the first foil shaver that I&#x60;ve ever had good luck with.  I tried the arcitec by Norelco and it was a good shaver but it is not as good as the Braun. I get no razor burn with the Braun, even on the neck. I do use Williams lectric shave though.</li>
    <li> I almost never write reviews about products I buy, typically because I am so friggin busy that its not a priority.  I bought the Braun Pulsonic a few weeks ago and I was so impressed with the quality that I had to finally breakdown and share my impressions.    I have been using an electric razor for 10 years. I switched because I was tired of nicks and and all the hassles of blade shaving.  While the convenience has been great, I have never been completely satisfied with the closeness of my shaves with the various Norelco units I have used over the years.  I had been eyeing Braun for a while because of the cleaning system but I only recently bought one when I was intrigued by the Pulsonic and it&#x27;s claims to shake up deep resting hairs which typically turn into ingrown hairs no matter how much effort you put in trying to get rid of them.    First, I&#x27;ll say that the product is prohibitively expensive for a lot of people which is an unfortunate mark against it and Braun should really have lowered the introductory price to make it more affordable.  That is the down side - now for the praise.    The Braun Pulsonic took about three days to adjust to my skin type and face - most other razors I have used usually take a few weeks to break in and for the irritation to subside.  While it is a bit noisy, the pulsing action lives up to the hype.  I have never gotten such a close shave in my life.  It even requires less passes than a blade razor which I thought was amazing.  My morning shave takes about 5 minutes versus the 10 - 15 it took with my Norelcos.  The end result is such a close shave that, when I run my hand accross my face, I rarely feel any stubble which is quite common with even the most popular of electric shavers.  My skin is less irritated and the texture of my skin surface seems more even since I started using it (I have uneven, sensitive skin which is prone to minor breakouts and redness). I think the pulsing effect actually gets the blood flow moving in your face and helps to tone (my perception, not scientifically proven).    If you can get over the astronomical price and you can deal with the slightly louder noise, this will be an investment in grooming that you will thank yourself for for years to come.    I read some of the negative reviews and I have come to the conclusion that some of them are just people who complain about everything and will never be satisfied.   Again, I never write these things and I am extremely picky, so this review is as honest as it gets.  This product stands up and even exceeds its marketing hype.   I hope you are as satisfied as I am.[[ASIN:B000IWFU3W Braun 9595 Pulsonic Shaving System]]</li>
    <li> Amazing... Super close shave, so much closer than the model it replaced. The design is nicer, except the trimmer, which is just not well done at all... Works okay for trimming side burns, BUT that&#x27;s IT!  Otherwise, wow, fantastic! Excellent closeness, near 12 hours coverage. Never seen before in nearly 30 years of electric shaving... Remarkable, no pulled hairs yet. Super close... Comfortable... Downside: Loud, and louder to clean than the 360... trimmer pretty much stinks....</li>
    <li> I highly recommend the Braun Pulsonic 9595 electric razor.  Not only does it give me the closest shave from an electric razor I have ever experienced, the convenience of periodically placing the razor in the base to be cleaned, lubricated, charged and blades sharpened is awesome!  The Braun does all that with one touch of a button.  No more messing with tiny brushes trying to get hair out of an electric razor.  You can also run the head under water to rinse off if you wish.  WOW!  What an electric razor!</li>
    <li> I have tried others and this is the BEST.  It is always good to do a razor blade shave every other week to get the best out of an electric shaver!!!</li>
    <li> This is a matchless razor - absolutely remarkable.  Like many men, and particularly black men, I get ingrown hairs, razor bumps and all kinds of irritation. I&#x27;ve tried everything to fight what seemed to be a losing battle - from the gillette fusion &amp; mach 3, to electric shavers and even straight razors.    So after reading the glowing reviews on this site, I decided to take the plunge and try this Braun Pulsonic. I had experimented with a Norelco a few years back but ditched it after a couple of months. This Braun thing, however, is in a league of its own. It&#x27;s by far the smoothest, quickest,  most hassle-free razor I&#x27;ve ever used.     Obviously, it&#x27;s not going to give the kind of perfectly smooth shave that you&#x27;d expect from a gillette or straight razor - but it does come pretty close. If you&#x27;re looking for something that&#x27;s going to keep razor bumps in check, then this is a definite winner.     I&#x27;m thoroughly impressed by this superb razor. I realize it&#x27;s quite expensive (i&#x27;m a student) but if you can afford it, give it a try. I doubt you&#x27;ll regret it.</li>
    <li> Summary: Braun promises the closest and most comfortable shave. They&#x27;ve clearly delivered the second, but failed on the first promise (at least for my skin/hair type).    Longer review:   About my razor usage: I don&#x27;t usually shave every day, so I don&#x27;t care much how clean each shave is. But I do care about ease of shave, and skin comfort. I&#x27;ve used Braun 4-series and 5-series before. My hair is rather strong, and grows non-perpendicular, so it was hard to shave, and required pressing the razor against the skin, sometimes causing irritations.    The new Braun shaves without pressing the razor at all, much better and more comfortable that the 5-series. It is now a pleasure to shave, suddenly I don&#x27;t mind doing it every day.    But if you care about how close it shaves, I do not see any improvements at all - actually it is worse than 5-series, even when pressed agains the skin. It always leaves me about half of the \\&quot;5 o&#x27;clock shadow\\&quot; - which is surprising giving the reviews and ads. But this works for me anyway - I care more about the comform rather than how clean it shaves.    About the feel of the rasor - it is very comfortable to hold, the construction feels good. My only concern is flip-out trimmer - it looks flimsy. The trimmer of my 4-series Braun had similar construction and broke down pretty quick. The sliding trimmer of 5-series was more solid and is still working without any problem.</li>
    <li> I previously owned 2 different Norelco rotary shavers and found them to be just \\&quot;fair\\&quot; in closeness....good for a six hour shave, used when I wanted to avoid the blade.  Although I was achieving an excellent shave with a blade I found that my skin became too dry in the winter despite using post shave moisturizers.  I decided to try the Pulsonic and have been very pleased.  It takes about 2-3 weeks of daily use to achieve a close shave from this shaver. It is comfortable to use, and it is the best dry shave I have every experienced.  I have used it daily for a month, and while a blade is still the best for closeness, this is an excellent alternative. A few times I have done a touch up shave in the evening before going out. I am new to the self cleaning device, it works well and I tend to use it every other day to extend the life of the cleaning cartridge as recommended in other reviews.  I traveled with the Pulsonic over the holidays and although I brought the charger, I did not need to use it; after 12 days there was still battery life left. My only criticism is that the shaver is louder than the rotary shavers, not painfully loud, just that a quieter experience would be more welcome in the morning when I am trying to clear my head for the day ahead.  Overall, the Pulsonic is an excellent shaver, appears well made, and has allowed me to avoid a wet/blade shave.</li>
    <li> This razor was much better and gave a closer shave than previous razors I have had.  However, there is one spot on either side of my neck that is apparently impossible for the razor to reach, dispite trying every angle.  Even after several days of growth it cannot cut the hair.  So I still need to use a blade twice a week to get a descent shave.</li>
    <li> The reviews for this Braun shaver have impressed me. However, why does Braun think that it is necessary to make shavers that are rechargeable?  I would bet that if there was a poll taken to see if men would prefer a simple corded shaver, there would be an overwhelming majority for that type of shaver.     I myself, and am sure other men don&#x27;t need the hassle of having the additional cumbersome charger &amp; gimmicky cleaner. Braun should go back a take a look at the model 5422 that they made some time ago. That was the epitome of a great electric shaver!  Because of the void they created when they discontinued that model, it prompted a small company to try to reintroduce a prototype of the Braun 5422. Despite the good intention of the company, and I&#x27;m sure they have sold many of them, the shaver falls short of the Braun 5422 in performance &amp; design.    Braun would make many men happy if they would bring back the 5422!</li>
    <li> After many shavers,   I bought this one for my husband, he says it is the best shaver he has ever had.   Just loves it!</li>
    <li> 22Feb2008  I have used this shaver for more than three months.  It is the best electric shaver I have ever used.  I am 76 years old and have used many different electric shaver for the last 60 years.</li>
    <li> I really like the shave this Braun gives.  It is closer than the last two Braun&#x27;s I have owned - in fact, it is the closest shave I have had outside of a straight razor.  And the best part is, I don&#x27;t have to &#x27;press&#x27; on my face or go back and forth several times to get it - which was a procedure I used to do with the previous Braun&#x27;s - regardless of how new the blade was.  Consequently, you can really use a &#x27;light touch&#x27; when using this razor - which mean less irritation - and for me, less bumps - while still getting a close shave!    I can&#x27;t say how long the battery lasts between charges, but I know it lasts at least a week - and if the previous two Braun&#x27;s I have owned are any indication, you should be able to get two weeks between charges.    As far as I am concerned, they hit a home run with this one.    One minor thing - this Braun is fairly noisy - not twice as noisy as the last two Braun&#x27;s I have owned - but noisy enough - you couldn&#x27;t use it with a baby sleeping in the next room, for sure! Just an FYI.</li>
    <li> Buyer beware! I purchased a Braun Activator 8595 Razor less than 2 years ago. I spent $170.00 on it in that course of time, I always use a pre-shave solution. Braun says they recommend not to use it, however all other brand razors have no issues with it. This razor is supposed to be stainless steel, apparently it isn&#x27;t as this razor has been rusting. The service center without seeing it has doubted my claim, that it is virtually impossible, they say it may be discolored but not rust. As you know when something is rusty it is bumpy, not smooth. I have pictures to prove it, but mysteriously, Braun does not have an e-mail address that I can forward the pictues to. When I first spoke to Braun around 2/20/08, they gave me this authorized service center name and number. I called it and the announcement said that the center was closed as the owner had an emergency appendectomy and would return calls when he returned, needless to say I called him on 2/28/08, he never returned my call. He told me that I had to get an authorization number from Braun, he wouldn&#x27;t be able to do anything for me as long as the razor worked also Braun does not give out authorization numbers. I guess they do not consider rusting a factor as part of their warranty. Between Braun and the \\&quot;authorized service center\\&quot;, they kept me going around in circles with phone calls. They told me that if it was covered under the warranty I would be all set, but if not...then I am responsible for the repair charges. Since when is rust a cosmetic part of the razor that would not be covered by their warranty. I told them that I was never so disappointed with their customer service that I was trashing their razor and switching to Norelco. A reputable company would not allow a customer to feel this way and work with them on resolving the issue at hand. If you buy a Braun, you are making a big mistake!</li>
    <li> This is definitely one of the best performing electric shavers I have ever used. The user can shave faster than with this shaver than using its predecessor and also the skin is a lot smoother afterwards. I have been using this shaver for one month and cannot say too much but first impression is very promising.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used electric shavers for over 40 years and must have used almost every one out there. This Braun is Average to Good..Clearly not Very Good or Outstanding which I would have expected from Braun or from this price range.  PROS  Shaves pretty well but not outstanding. I was intrigued by the irregular shaped holes in the shaving screen. I expected that they would capture stray hairs better than a round hole in everyone else&#x27;s screen.  CONS  It doesn&#x27;t shave any better than my 10 yr old Panasonic that has a metal frame (not cheap plastic) and a metal shaving head that holds the shaving screen. A very quality feel to the Panasonic--not the Braun. The Braun feels like cheap plastic which is not what is expected in the most expensive shaver on the market. Unfortunately Panasonic now only uses plastic too otherwise I would buy it again. The large, liquid cleaning system seems to be a gimmick...it takes a lot of room in the bathroom, requires refills of the cleaning goop and cleaning shavers have never been a problem to be solved. It&#x27;s inconceivable that they do not include a small plastic cover to go over the delicate shaving screen when traveling. Included is a moulded plastic container into which the shaver fits for traveling but it doesn&#x27;t fit in my shaving kit. All I want is a plastic cap to protect the screen and I put it in my shaving kit for traveling. I don&#x27;t think the product development people use electric shavers. It&#x27;s unfortunately not unique</li>
    <li> When my trusty Norelco bit the dust, I looked for a replacement and came across this Braun Pulsonic. The really nice thing about it is the self cleaning system. The only negative is that for some reason I expected a closer shave than I actually get. All in all, it&#x27;s a nice electric razor but perhaps a bit over priced.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 64 year old male who has never been satisfied with an electric razor till now.  My heavy beard has never seen such a close electric shave.  Finally, I have shelved my shaving cream for good.  Thanks Braun.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about this shaver because the other products I have used before weren&#x27;t that great. From manual blade shavers to a few electric shavers which didn&#x27;t cost much. I ended up paying a few extra dollars for this but it was well worth it. After using this shaver I was so surprised that I didn&#x27;t get irritation burns or have a messy sink. I would get a clean shave and felt good about it. I would recommend this to anyone else who cares about their face.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000Q6SU3C Braun Pulsonic System 9595 with LCD Screen]]    Awesome shaver... everything it was advertised to be.  Buying through Amazon was the cheapest, and delivery was as promised.  They even shipped to a different address than home with no problems/issues.  Overall, a very pleasant purchasing experience and an excellent product, at the right price.</li>
    <li> I have owned three Braun electric razors in the \\&quot;cleaning\\&quot; series; a 7 series, and 8 series and now the 9 series.  The 7 series I have given to a family member and it is five years old and still as solid as ever.  The 8 series I accidentally left in a hotel room in Europe so I had to buy a new one.  Given how much I loved my 8 series I thought I would try the 9 Pulsonic series.  I waited two months to review it to see if it lived up to the hype and I can say now it does.  I have a heavy beard but with alot of small flat hairs on the lower part of my neck.  This razor handles both exceptionally well and it takes fewer passes than even my 8 series did.  You have to use it for 2-3 weeks for your whiskers to adapt, so be patient with it.  I highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> This actually lives up to the hype!  Close Close Close shave.  No razor burn, no irritation.</li>
    <li> The Braun Pulsonic 9595 changed the way I view electric razors.  Years ago I started with an electric razor, but could not get a close smooth shave.      I switched to a blade and have been using the Fusion for the past few years.  Overall, I was satisfied with the blade, but longed for the ease of an electric.    I saw that the Braun had Gillette blades and pulsonic technology, so I gave it a try.  In one word, EXCELLENT!  The Braun is very easy to use, comfortable and, most importantly, produces a very smooth, close shave.  In fact, the results are very near to those of my Fusion.  This is a very good shaver and worthy of consideration for those who think they need a blade for a close shave.    I also like the cleaning technology.  The razor has performed flawlessly.</li>
    <li> I think worryingly my comments have been expressed repeatedly and the problems I have experienced seem to be shared by others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick dark stubble and the following is what I found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problems so far are that I just don&#x27;t get a clean shave. There is no way I can arrive at work with patchy stubble like this. I know many say 3 weeks but what should I do in those 3 weeks? I don&#x27;t have time to practice which is the reason I got this but I guess I&#x27;ll keep trying. I just had to resort to a wet shave this morning though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver gets hot, doesn&#x27;t clean shave, despite going over the same area several times (very difficult on chin and neck) and stretching the skin in all directions, and actually starts to irritate by the end of the shave. Very worryingly, its been catching on slightly more prominent stubble! Ouch....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the parts that do shave well are very clean (just below the sideburns), the unit looks great, it has excellent grip, and the cleaning feature is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this early stage, I&#x27;m very worried and would give it an early 1 star if it wasn&#x27;t for its looks. I didn&#x27;t buy it for that though so a return may be in order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It appears to me from roughly combining the reviews so far, if you&#x27;re used to electric shavers, this is a good product but if you&#x27;re used to wet shaves, this might never match expectations, such is the quality of a decent wet shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update my review in due course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Really wanted to love this and use it frequently and regularly. Sadly, it didn&#x27;t happen. gave up on it. Sitting idle in my bathroom - looks good at least...</li>
    <li> My last two electric shavers have been Braun so after reading up on this one and checking the reviews, I figured I&#x27;d give it a try despite the $200.00+ price(yes, I am frugal).  Once again, Braun didn&#x27;t let me down as this shaver does an excellent job of making my face baby smooth.  If I just go over my face quickly, it keeps me pretty smooth most of the day.  If I take my time and do a thorough job, it&#x27;ll keep me smooth into the next morning.  And no shaving foam/gel to deal with.  Woo-hoo!  I also like the readout that tells me when I need to clean and charge it up.  No wondering...  did I clean this yesterday or was it three days ago?  Excellent product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s true when it says it&#x27;s the best shave ever. Much lighter and easier to use compared to the earlier models. I&#x27;m glad I purhcased a new one instead of just replacing the foil and screen on the old Braun model.</li>
    <li> This electric shaver, although a bit expensive initially, gives a very close shave.  Much better than two other Braun shavers I owned and thought were good.  Has a unique vibrating head and helps cut down actual shaving time due to less going over and over same area.  Now I know it was worth the price.</li>
    <li> Simply put, the best razor on the market today.  Incredible shave, almost as close as a blade.  Although I have a sensitive skin (especially on the neck), I have no problems with this razor.  I have used many brands, most either fall apart or have too many downfalls...this thing is a keeper.  Sturdy, great shave, and an outstanding cleaning system.  Worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have been a Norelco man since I started saving. I figured I&#x27;d give another high end electric razor a try. Ultimately, I don&#x27;t think one is necessarily better or worse, but there are trade offs to each.    This razor gives a slightly closer shave than a high end Norelco. It&#x27;s a little more bearable to skip a day between shaves if I need to.    The downside to that, though, is that it is a little more irritating to the skin. When I&#x27;m done, it feels more like I shaved with a real razor and I want to use a little lotion or aftershave.    One other difference...I think the shape of the head gets the shave done in less passes and does a pretty good job with the area under my jaw line, but the trade off is that it&#x27;s a little worse at shaving smaller areas such as the area under my nose or finessing around my sideburns.    It&#x27;s nice having a clean razor each time I us it (though I usually clean it every other shave), but I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s anything that special, especially as you have to continue to purchase the cleaning cartridges.    All in all, I like it enough to keep it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this razor from Amazon based on a lot of research and reading highly rated reviews.  I&#x27;ve never spent this much on an electric razor.  I wanted very badly to be perfectly happy with it.  It looks awesome, is well-balanced in the hand, quieter than my old razor and the battery life is ridiculously long.  I shaved 4 times (no just 2 minute shaves either) and only one bar out of 6 is gone from the battery meter (leading me to believe it may last as much as a month on one charge).  Add the cleaning base to keep it fresh and what more could you ask for?    But, I found myself doing a lot of \\&quot;re-shaving\\&quot; (following all shaving suggestions in the manual) and even with that...I was still able to go back with my old razor (Remington 2810, Microscreen Intercept w/ 3 year-old cutters and screens) and cut some spots left behind by the Pulsonic.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the Pulsonic&#x27;s shave looked fine, but I go by feel.  If I still feel rough spots, I shave them again.  Unfortunately, I&#x27;ll be going back to the old razor.</li>
    <li> So I paid some 200+ dollars for this shaver and my mistake was I expected some amazing results. Don&#x27;t get me wrong the shaver gives a pretty close shave after you go over the same areas quite a few times. I think any shaver would give a close shave if you went over the same areas over and over again. Took me about 20mins to shave a days stubble.   My old shaver, a Remington took lesser time but didn&#x27;t give quite the close shave as the Braun. So it looks great, and has the pricey look and feel to it and does an OK job at shaving. Price difference between my old shaver and the Braun was about $140.   Bottom line, is it worth the $200+.... No its not. There are other foil electric shavers in the market that would cost less and give you the same results. Also other shavers have similar features like self cleaning, cleaning under running water and replaceable cleaning cartridges. (This Braun does come with a pretty sleek looking carry case. I really like that.)  You will not be disappointed when you buy this, however don&#x27;t expect miracles just because this probably costs at least a $100 more than you average electric shaver.</li>
    <li> my boyfriend has really sensitive skin so, every time he shaved, he would be left with a lot of irritation and bleeding at times.  the hair on his face and neck also grow in different directions so he has to go over the same area more than once, increasing the irritaion.  i love it when he is clean-shaven, but i wouldn&#x27;t push him to shave because i know it&#x27;s painful for him so...  i began to look for an answer to those horrible razors he&#x27;s been using and i came across this product.  after reading that it won \\&quot;best razor\\&quot; of the year in multiple men&#x27;s magazines, i bought it and HE LOVES IT!  he shaves everyday because it doesn&#x27;t hurt him at all.  he&#x27;s been using it for about 3 weeks now and, just last night, he was touching his face saying, \\&quot;i can&#x27;t believe how smooth it is.  it&#x27;s like i&#x27;m naked!\\&quot;  the only gripe i have with this product is that it&#x27;s going to be virtually impossible to top such an amazing gift for his next birthday!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used an electric shaver for about 60 years. I am very pleased with this one; it is by far the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> My old 8000 series Braun got left in a hotel room, so I figured I&#x27;d upgrade.  However, this model does not shave my beard as well as the older model.  My beard hairs grown in all directions and lay very flat.  The Pulsonic had a tendency to yank them out, and it took pass after pass to get an area shaved clean.  I finally gave it to my Dad (he&#x27;s got a more normal beard and it works fine for him) and just bought a 8985 model, which works great.&lt;br /&gt;So, be forewarned--this shaver might not work well for you, and it&#x27;s NON-RETURNABLE.&lt;br /&gt;However, it&#x27;s very well made and seems to work great for my father, so I feel I need to give it four stars.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this item!!!  I got it as a gift for someone and then realized he only uses straight razors.  Now I am stuck with a very expensive paper weight with no way to return it for credit or cash!!!  I wish I had noticed the return policy as it is generally my philosophy to never purchase items which cannot be returned.  If this were really such a great product, they would have no problem accepting and re-selling a returned, unopened box.</li>
    <li> As a long time user of Braun products, I decided to try out the remmington and philishave shavers and found that the triple head gave me a bad rash and the remmington had me repeat shave often.  I returned to Braun and decided to plunk down the extra cash for this machine.  I am very happy I decided to come back to Braun as it was kind to my sensitive skin as well as giving me a very smooth shave according to my wife.  The cleaning set up of the shaver is fantastic and practically painless.  I reccommend you open the cleaning head to rid the excess hairs before doing the cleaning.  If you want a clean trouble free shave get this one.</li>
    <li> If your wondering if this shaver head mechanically does what it should, never fear, it conforms to your face exactly, like no other.  Plus the shave is close, fast, with no burning or skin damage.  This shaver has one other high point when finished with its clean cycle, it smells like a disinfected lemon.  Way to go German engineers!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a terrific shaver. I was one of these guys who said never to an electric shaver. A few months ago I bought one of them small shavers they advertised on TV i got a pretty good shave but had to work for it. I thought that wow if this little piece could give me a decent shave the Braun had to be terrific. I cant believe how close a shave I get and without all the irritation I get with a regular hand held shaver. I highly recommend this razor its a beauty. I can shave in three minutes and be done. If you never had an electric shaver before your missing out on a thing of beauty.</li>
    <li> In the past I had used a rotary razor for 5 years, previously I had been a bic shaver with gel/foam for 40 years. I dedided to give Braun a try since it had several good reviews and I needed something more hygienic. To my surprise the Braun pulsonic shaver does an excellent job. It does not irritate my face as did the bic or rotary shavers. The shave is closer (better) than the others and my face feels very smooth after shaving. My wife even complimented that my face was much smoother with the Braun as she noticed the difference immediately. The fact that it vibrates gives your face a massage as you are shaving. The cleaning bath works well and gives the shaver a fresh clean feel and smell. I am glad I SWITCHED and love my new electric razor. The only fault is the weight which I can live with. Try it for yourself it comes with a money back guarantee. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Fathers Day Gift for my husband.  He complains that no razor give a great shave, he is loving this one.  Says it is the closest shave and best shaving he has had with an electric.  Had so much fun shaving took his mustache off (which I love) without even trimming the hairs first.  The delivery time was exceptional.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these about 18 months ago. So far I have had it repaired twice and at this point, I am on Amazon looking to replace it as it is now not functioning again. I have been using electric shavers for almost 20 years and will never buy a Braun product again.</li>
    <li> I switched from a blade to a Braun shaver over 20 years ago when the original came out.  This is my fourth, and by far the best.  The 10000 rpm motor cuts down my shaving time, and shaves more consistently than my previous one.    I considered the Panasonic Vortex, but I thought I would try the Braun first since it did have a 60 day money back guarantee.  I am completely satisfied, so this one will not be going back.</li>
    <li> What a great shaver!  This is the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten. The product is well made and comes with good accessories as well.  The cleaning/charging base is sturdy and well made and does a great job of cleaning, drying and charging the shaver.  My only complaint is that you may need to buy new cleaning fluid every month or so.  This can add up, as these cost about six dollars a piece.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this razor as an upgrade from my previous Braun shaver (360 Complete 8985) and the Pulsonic is a definite upgrade.  I get a significantly closer shave and in far less time.  One thing I will say, however, is that I&#x27;ve seen a few people/websites claim that they just need one pass with this razor when shaving - that isn&#x27;t the case for me, and I find that hard to believe with any electric razor.  It does require multiple passes, but still far less than any electric I&#x27;ve ever used, and it irritates my skin far less.  Some reviewers have cited the pop-up trimmer as being a bit awkward - I would agree to a certain extent, but I&#x27;ve still been able to use it to trim my sideburns fairly easily.  Also, while the cost may scare away some, Braun electrics are very well made - I&#x27;ve owned Braun razors for 5+ years in some instances.  If you keep this for a few years, and use the clean and renew less liberally than Braun wants you to (I use it once a week or so) this razor is far more cost effective than it would appear on the surface.    Overall, a 5 star product.  Far and away the best electric I&#x27;ve ever owned, and I look forward to owning it for years to come.</li>
    <li> I decided I did not care about price because I wanted the best electric razor on the market....to put it simply this does not create even close to a CLEAN SHAVE look. And I still have to use a straight razor under my chin because this electric razor does nothing for that area. This did not work for me...good luck to others.</li>
    <li> I bought this electric razor, but  I&#x27;m quite disappointed with it!  I will be returning it soon.</li>
    <li> very fast delivery. Very easy to use. easy to keep clean. does a good job</li>
    <li> One reviewer called this \\&quot;the best razor ever made\\&quot;. While I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true, it is a good product. For the first couple of months that I have used it, I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the operation at all. Personally, the quality of the shave, I think, could be improved. That would be my only gripe. Otherwise, it has been a reliable razor.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this shaver. Not only will it take away 2 day stubble with ease and no pulling, but I haven&#x27;t got even the slightest razor burn. It offers a good close shave, and is well designed. Granted you can get a closer shave with a razor but not with this kind of comfort. I may have found my last shaver.</li>
    <li> This review is based entirely upon my initial impressions as I have only used the razor a few times.  I will update the review as needed with further use of the product.  For readability, i&#x27;ve broken the review into several sections:    Design - of course the design matters, it&#x27;s the first thing that you see and determines how the razor will interact with your face.  With a blue and silver exterior, the razor sure looks fancy.  To match its external prowess, the razor utilizes a tilting head to completely shave your face - this works great.  This model also comes with a handy locking mechanism for the head to reach hard to get areas on your face - also works great. Overall design:  A+    Comfort - the comfort of the shave is great, no burning, no pulling, and a very minimal amount of irritation.  Overall comfort:  A+    Noise/Heat - This is my biggest complaint with the razor so far - it&#x27;s fairly loud (at least compared to Norelco rotary razors i&#x27;ve used in the past).  Also, there seems to be a fair amount of heat radiated (not uncomfortable at all though) by the foil unit - this is only noticeable when using the lock on the tilting function.  Overall noise:  B    Performance - This is of course the most important part of the shaver - will it at the end of day adequately shave your face?  With no reservations, I can say that this razor does a fabulous job of shaving one&#x27;s face.  It misses very little hair and thus requires a minimal amount of rehasing on your face.  Much better over Norelco rotaries (esp the wet shave system) and comparable (but not quite as good) to an \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; blade.  Performance:  A+    Cleaning and Charging System:  The razor seems to charge fairly quickly, with the ability for a quick charge or to plug the AC adapter directly into the razor.  The cleaning system seems adequate - Braun suggests to clean the razor after every use, I don&#x27;t think this is necessary and will probably only clean every several uses as the Clean and Renew solution is an added cost (~ $4 a cartridge).  You can also clean the razor the old fashion way with water and remove the cartridge head - but the clean and renew system seems so much better.  The only downside is the engineering of the clean and renew cartridges - you open them and they almost immediately spill a little.  I would like to have seen an elevated spout for opening to avoid this problem.  Overall cleaning and charging:  A    Overall comments - If your sick of the lack of quality from comparably priced rotary shavers and/or don&#x27;t like the cuts, roughness, and cost of a shave from a blade, then this razor is certainly a good candidate for you.  As far as cost is concerned, it doesn&#x27;t seem too bad, though there is a large initial investment in the razor (NOTE:  amazon often offers 50 dollars off a future order with a purchase of at least $139 in products from Braun/Oral-B).  In addition, there is a small amount of maintenance costs in the form of replacing the cartridge/foil unit  (about $30 - Braun recommends this be done once a year) and refilling the clean and renew system (about $4/ea from amazon in the 3 pack) where the latter is highly dependent on how much you personally clean the razor and your use of water instead of the clean and renew system.  Overall, this is the best razor i&#x27;ve ever used and don&#x27;t regret the purchase at all!  Overall grade - A    P.S.  - For those of that are still worried about Amazon&#x27;s no-return policy on this item, Braun offers a 60 day money back gurantee in the US.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver 1 year ago for myself and found it to be the best electric shaver I had ever used. I still use a multibladed razor also and feel that using both the bladed and electric works for me.  The electric seems to shave me better around the mouth and chin area and the bladed seems to shave the neck better.    A year later I purchased another Braun 9595 for a Christmas present to my son-in-law.  He did not like it and I returned it.    I gave it a 4 because of the individual opinion issue.  The quality of the product really is 5 star though.  If you are inclined to like the electric shaver this one is the best!</li>
    <li> I have just a few words for this shaver - it works. And it works great! And then cleans itself and after itself. And then it tells you all about itself - how clean it is, and how charged it is. What else do you need from a shaver - to cook? Get back to earth.    Seriously now, I am very impressed on how it shaves, and how well it works with 2-3 day old growth: no pain, no pulling. I used to dread those shaves when you miss a day or two of shaving - those rotary shavers would make you suffer for your neglect for long-long minutes. With this shaver it does not take really longer and the feelings are the same.    Bottom line - if you still have another shaver - get this one. It is great and you will love it!</li>
    <li> Read some mixed reviews on this product prior to purchasing.  I&#x27;ve owned a lot of electric shavers in my time, but this one is superior.  A little noisier then I would have liked, but more than made up for with the auto-cleaning function.  Just pop it in the charger unit, and it cleans and charges itself automatically. Ready to go the next time around.  Also gives the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had from an electric shaver.  Good buy.</li>
    <li> First off I didn&#x27;t start shaving with electric razor until I was 50. I had tried 2-3 Norelco razors and they would burn your face after a few minutes of going over and over and I would still have a pretty good beard. I bought my first Braun about 12 years ago and I just bought this 4th razor from Braun. It takes a few days to see if you can really get a decent shave with an electric. Every guy I know who has shaved with an electric has a little different story. I think it&#x27;s as difficult to get a 100% close shave with an electric as it is to get a 100% close shave with a safety razor and shaving cream without nicking yourself a couple of times. I used the Braum and it shaved me better than any electric I had ever used....bar none. This is my 4th Braun. I like the ease of cleaning it with the automatic cleaner and you can stretch the cleaning fluid two months if you don&#x27;t try to clean daily. I tried that and found that cleaning the head about once or twice weekly is sufficient. Braun is the best electric I have used and I&#x27;ll buy another. This new one has the best feel holding it and shaving with it as any I have owned. If you can use an electric you will love this one. It shaves me about 90% as close as I can get in a regular shave. My beard grows every direction. I have a friend or two who just don&#x27;t like an electric razor but they never tried an electric over a few times before giving up.</li>
    <li> Shaves close.  Has maintained itself with the Braun system.  You can buy cheaper razors, be disappointed in short order, and begin looking again to spend more money.  Get it out of the way once and for all and buy the Braun 7 if you&#x27;re convinced you want an electric razor.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it. He is extremely picky about his shave and equipment and has had only positive comments about it. I am relieved!</li>
    <li> I find that the Pop-out trimmer mechanism is a bit awkward compared to previous models and the head lock switch is poorly placed. However, the actual shave result appears to be better; closer and less irritating.</li>
    <li> The charging base of the first unit that I received was broken.  That was when I learned that this product cannot be RMA&#x27;ed due to the fact that it contains a small cartridge of cleaning fluid.  How come it is okay for Amazon to ship this product to us, but not okay for us to ship it back to them?  After much ado with Amazon&#x27;s customer service, they finally agreed to send a replacement.    The replacement unit works fine.  I have been using it for about three weeks now.  I clean the shaver after every use or every other use, but never more than two uses.  However, I still do not experience that \\&quot;amazing\\&quot; close shave that everyone has been raving about.  Prior to this shaver, I had been using the Gillette M3Power razor.  A fresh M3Power blade gives a closer shave than the Braun, but the problem is that it loses its sharpness very quickly (like after two uses).  In the pursue of the ultimate shave and having read all the positive reviews here, I decided to give this a try.  I am sorry to report that it is not better.  I had hoped that it would be, but it is not.  Oh, the long term cost of the cleaning fluid is comparable to that of changing razor blades (about $6 per month).    I am giving it a 3 star for (1) poor quality control for letting a defective unit out the door, and (2) a less than stellar shaving performance.  At this price point, nothing less than perfection is acceptable.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a very old-world, made in Germany feel to the shaver.  Sure there&#x27;s plastic, but not the flimsy \\&quot;I&#x27;ll have to replace it in a year\\&quot; feel to most Chinese made consumer electronics.  Simply stated, I like it enough to have bought a year&#x27;s supply of cleaning solution after 2 weeks--look around, you can find it less expensively than Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve found.  Doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s perfect though.  The base tends to get clogged up and you have to figure out a way to clean it.  The shaver holder in the base wears out and the shaver won&#x27;t meet the connectors on the base.  These basically last about 1 1/2 years.  I have to use an electric shaver and I want one that shaves close.  This one shaves closer than anyone I&#x27;ve found without irritating your skin.</li>
    <li> I owned the previous version of this shaver and was very happy with it. I&#x27;ve had Braun shavers for 20 years. I find their shavers give the closest and smoothest shave of all other brands on the market. This latest model isn&#x27;t cheap, but it&#x27;s well worth the additional expense.  It cleans itself with the push of a button. I can take two or even three shaves before having to clean it which saves on cleaning cartridge costs.  It also will tell you when you need to change the cartridge or change the cutting head (which now comes in one piece). It has a head angle lock for shaving under the nose and of course a trimmer for neck and side burns. All I can say is \\&quot;try it, you&#x27;ll love it\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> **EDIT**  After a month of shaving the shave times have gotten longer, the shaves are less close, and my skin is getting to the point that after going over and over the same spot I can&#x27;t shave again for at least a day or so because of the irritation...  So, I changed my cleaning fluid, bought a new head, and am giving it a shot.  But, even if it does get back to the perfect shaves it gave me on day one, spending $50 for a new head and cleaner every month and a half is not my idea of a great product.  If that&#x27;s gong to be the case, I can&#x27;t see giving this shaver any more than 3 stars down the road.    **Original Review**  In short, I expected a lot from this shaver after reading the reviews but I didn&#x27;t expect it to be this fantastic.      The long of it goes a little bit like this:    I haven&#x27;t shaved with a razor in something ridiculous, like 9 years, as my face can never take it.  Even once my face gets used to the razor again, just stopping for a few days makes me break out like a teenager if I try to shave again.  So, with no hope of a baby faced shave, I moved on to beard trimmers and simply lived with a close 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, letting people assume my middle eastern heritage gave me wolfman like features by mid-day.  Every now and then I&#x27;d venture back to an electric shaver only to discover they pulled the hair out, left my face irritated, didn&#x27;t reach those \\&quot;hard to reach places\\&quot; (go figure), or left a massive mess in the sink, etc.  And again, I&#x27;d slink back to my beard trimmer, my girlfriend left only to assume that she wouldn&#x27;t see me with a clean face again until the day we got married and it really mattered.    But, being in my late 20&#x27;s and consistently being in front of clients finally pushed me to do something about it (and only 9 years in...).  So, after reading the reviews I bought the Braun Series 7 and jumped in with both feet.  Much to my suprise, my first shave was as close as I&#x27;ve ever gotten with a razor, twice as fast, and left no irritation,no in grown hairs, no break outs, and no redness.  Not only that, but the miniscule amount of hair in the sink makes my girfriend think I take the time to clean up after every shave even when I&#x27;m in a hurry!  I can&#x27;t say enough about this razor, and while I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to, simply knowing it has done its job for a month straight with no issues, and hasn&#x27;t seemed to dull at all, astounds me.     I can&#x27;t think of the last thing I bought that was this useful, and that I&#x27;m as appreciative for each time I use it.  Can I say more than I would shave MAYBE once a year with a razor and since the day I bought it I&#x27;ve shaved every morning with the Braun?!    Granted, it still won&#x27;t get every hair on your neck, but it does an amazingly good job of skimming over any ingrown hairs so you can pluck them out later, and not grabbing or yanking hairs that are slightly longer than the rest.    Nothing but 5 stars from me.</li>
    <li> I have tried all kinds of shavers - none have worked well for me except this one. There is no irritation (after the initial couple weeks of getting accustomed to it) which is unavoidable for me when using a blade. It also shaves very well everywhere on my face - including my neck. I have never used an electric shaver that even comes close in this regard. If you are even thinking about dropping the cash for this, I would go ahead and give it a try - it&#x27;s well worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> Of course it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade.   What does?  Of course the self-cleaner is noicy. Just don&#x27;t activate it before bedtime. Of course it&#x27;s pricy BUT worth every penny.  Had Norelco most of my life. Sorry I waited so long to switch to a Braun.  Well made with an amazing self-cleaner. Buy the best and only cry once.</li>
    <li> I have used a different Norelcos for about seven years. I got tired of them not shaving close enough, so I switched to a Gillette fusion. Shaving with that took way too much time. I switched to this which is amazing. I use it with Clinque electric shave primer and it is great. I had bad acne as a teen so my skin is pretty sensitive. This is the perfect razor if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> My wife calls me a razor/shaver connoisseur. I always have to try the next razor on the market. This Braun electric shaver is the best one I&#x27;ve used. I usually prefer a razor over an electric shaver, but this one has worked so well I&#x27;ve made the switch. I have not found an electric that can cut as close as a razor, but this one is close. About one week after getting my face accustomed to the Braun it is cutting closer and smoother. Give it a change and I think you&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
    <li> I have used a couple of different electric razors and this one is the best I have used so far. My most recent razor was a Norelco lotion dispensing unit. It wasn&#x27;t bad razor till the I tried to shave with it without any lotion. Without the lotion you would get the razor burn. I have yet to get that with this razor.     You do have to shave with it for a couple of weeks for your skin to get used to it, but after your skin gets used to it, you won&#x27;t ever get the razor burn effect.     I was a bit skeptical about the self cleaning on this razor, but it does work. I took the cutting head off after a cleaning and didn&#x27;t see any stubble.    The shave quality is great for an electric razor. The hair on my neck likes to pose a challenge for all razors. This razor does a great job of cutting them back. As long as you go against the grain and take your time, you will have a great close shave.     The razor is also capable of being charged away from the base and comes with a great hard carry case that protects your investment well when you are on the road.    The final great thing about this razor is that the only thing made in China is the smart plug. The razor is made in Germany.    This is a very expensive razor, but it is well worth the money. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have owned this shaver for almost 2 years now.  Love how close it shaves!  I thought I&#x27;d be let down, but I honestly can&#x27;t believe how well it shaves, especially compared to previous shavers I&#x27;ve had.  However, the directions tell you to go against the practice that all other shavers use, which is to NOT wash your face (or shower) before using, since your natural oils should do the trick.  I found it to be very rough this way, and not to shave well.  In addition, I was a little frustrated that on top of spending a lot of money for this shaver, that I would have to continually get refills for the cleaning solution.  So, I put down the for a couple of months and went back to blades.  Then, I decided to go against what the directions say, and shower first, use a pre-shave solution (Lectric Shave), and then shave.  Wow, what a difference.  I recommend everyone throw away the directions for this shaver!!  In addition, to get around having to buy refills, I simply replaced the solution in the refill with rubbing alcohol and a few splashes of pre-shave solution (Lectric Shave). It works GREAT, and saves a lot of money!!  I think Braun just wants users to not use any other products other than their own. This is the only reason I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars rather than 5 stars.  I only wish Braun would come up with a pre-electric shave solution.</li>
    <li> Good razor and works well, but long hair trimmer is a bit tough to use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been 4 weeks since I bought it, I&#x27;ve just replaced the first cleaning cartridge, so I thought it would be nice to write about my experience. For last several years I shaved every day with Wilkinson Quattro and even tried Gillette Fusion (BTW, WQ is better). They were okay, but I often had cuts and red patches that wouldn&#x27;t go away for hours. WQ cartridge would last for max 4-5 shaves, as I have thick beard hear, but that was ok. The problem I could not tolerate any more was ingrown hair, sometimes painful, sometimes just small red bumps on my neck. So I did a research and found how and why these occur and that I should be able to get rid of them if I switch to an electric shaver. Since I never used one before, I listed all the latest and found Braun 790cc to be probably the best one out there. It was 450 $AU, but I definitely decided to give it a try. So I did. And wow, I am so happy I did! :) It takes 2-3 weeks to get used to it, probably the time for which hair changes direction of growth and sharp ends caused by (manual) razors are removed, then it shaves as closely as WQ/GF. But, there are no more cuts, no red patches (skin irritation) and no more ingrown hair, and I mean none! :) Woohoo! Also, it takes me approx 10 mins to shave, which is almost half the time I used to shave with WQ/GF. Another cool thing with this shaver is that it comes with a box which is its charger/cleaner. Cleaning liquid is a mixture of alcohol and lubricant, so not only does it clean the machine, it also lubricates it. So I simply use it, put it back into its box, power it on and press the button for cleaning. I highly recommend it for anyone troubled with skin irritation and ingrown hair. Give it a try, you won&#x27;t regret. And yet another cool thing, it came with 60 days trial offer. You don&#x27;t like, simply return it and it will be refunded with no questions asked! Thank you Braun, but I will keep it! :)</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;ve only had it a few days, I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the Braun 790cc. I have owned an older model with the same sort of cleaning unit for about eight years and it was beginning to show it&#x27;s age. The new shaver seems to shave much closer but with less irritation. I would give it a top recommendation.</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun electric shavers for over 15 years and this is the best one yet.  It provides an extremely close shave with minimal use of pressure on the face.  It may take a little longer than a razor but the skin feels better and never a nick.  And while there is extra cost and effort in maintaining the cleaner fluid, the cleaning and charging cycle becomes part of the routine (I generally find cleaning every third day is good for me) and provides the best shaving experience for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a year and a half now. I was splurging on Christmas gift cards and thought expensive would mean good. When I first got it I was amazed. I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s why there&#x27;s so many great reviews. However over time I&#x27;ve been very unhappy in the durability. The foil/blades wore out after 6 months. You can&#x27;t find replacements in stores from what I found. I had to order a replacement online and have it overnighted while I was shaving with tape over the hole to protect my face. Keep your old razor guys for a back up. About one year into it the cleaning base doesn&#x27;t work well. The razor doesn&#x27;t contact it right and so doesn&#x27;t charge and clean. I&#x27;ve tried everything to clean the contacts but it just wont sit in there right anymore. In order to use the base now I have to place it in until I find the sweet spot, then tape it in with some surgical tape. I do this about once every week or so. So much for all these liquid refills I&#x27;ve got. These days it takes about as long to shave as it did with my old Norelco (which lasted three times as long and I replaced the blades only once). So I guess the Braun&#x27;s blades are only good for about a year. The battery is not as good now. I get about 3 shaves out of a charge. It never ever did a very good job on the occasional long hair or 3 days growth. Now I think for the money it should&#x27;ve been a much better experience. I can see now that the price is less than it was, but still too much if you ask me. I now think it&#x27;s gimmicky and over priced. Perhaps I just need new blades/foil now. But I&#x27;m thru with it, and much wiser. I think I&#x27;ll try a Panasonic next.</li>
    <li> I thought that by purchasing the Braun 790cc shaver, I was taking a step up from my old Norelco.  Ok. Forget the heavy vibration of the Braun motor. Forget the major effort to shave the side of my neck.  Forget that shaved hairs fall out of the side of the razor head.  Forget these things?  I think not.  Amazon does not accept returns of this type of product, so I guess it&#x27;s the trash for this baby.  It&#x27;s not pretty enough for a paperweight. AND, to add insult to injury, Amazon dropped the price, so I actually overpaid for this. I feel better having written this but I would still have preferred my $200 back.[[ASIN:B000Q6SU3C Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic  Shaver]]</li>
    <li> An excellent product that works well.      Being a Soldier for 23 years, I only tried one electric shaver over 10 years ago.  It was a poor experience so I never believed an electric shaver could give one a shave good enough for a Soldier to stand in a military formation.  I recently retired and figured I&#x27;d give an electric shaver one more try as I didn&#x27;t have to worry if it didn&#x27;t shave well.  I purchased this Braun and received it on 5 Feb 10 (now 13 Mar 10).  I have used it nearly every day, maybe not on one or two days, and was greatly surprised with the results.  Everyone told me to wait four to six weeks for my skin to adjust and I would get a better shave, which I have, though the shaves in the beginning were good enough for any Soldier to stand formation.  If I had known about this razor, or another earlier version of Braun, I could have saved many nicks from cold morning water bottle shaves when deployed.  Nothing will be as close as a razor to the skin, but this is the next best thing.  You can&#x27;t feel a whisker when rubbing with the growth, and feel a slight roughness when rubbing against the growth.  I guess that&#x27;s the best way I could describe the shave.    As for maintenance, the Braun 7 is great.  I shave, put it in the cradle, push the &#x27;clean&#x27; button, and walk away.  I replaced the cleaning solution on 11 Mar 10, so I had about 41 days on the first cartridge.  The &#x27;low&#x27; light was on, but I didn&#x27;t want to wait for the empty light.    The trimmer works well, even for trimming up my haircut on the back of my neck and around my ears.      I have never used more than two squares of the battery charge per shave - even a long one when I first used it - so I couldn&#x27;t imaging this thing draining a charge unless I didn&#x27;t plug it in for a week straight.    If you want to try an electric razor for the first time, or if you want to replace an existing one, I HIGHLY recommend this Braun.  It turned me into a believer in electric razors.</li>
    <li> My Panasonic Razor&#x27;s head broke so I decided to research and find a razor I liked.  Before the Panasonic, I had a Braun. The cleaning unit stopped working after two years. The Panasonic was a good razor--shaved close--hardly ever nicked, but the cleaning unit was extremely loud and lasted forever (3 hours).  So I first looked at several of the Norelcos. Never had one. I read all the reviews and it seems the Braun kept coming up as better. So I read the reviews of several of the Brauns. I spent several days looking and thinking that this Braun was a lot of money.  I&#x27;ll tell you what.  I am sooo glad I got this razor.  It is a smooth, close, comfortable shave.  Not quite as close as a manual razor, but pretty close to it.  No nicks or scrapes even the first use.  It is quieter running than the Panasonic and the cleaning unit is at least a third quieter, but lasts no more than 45 minutes. However, this model examines the razor to see how dirty it is and how low on battery.  It then has several options it automatically chooses depending on its need.  So, most days it does a very fast \\&quot;eco\\&quot; clean. I&#x27;ll tell you, this has got to be the best electric razor yet invented.  I highly recommend it.  I should also mention that Amazon.com is the best. It arrived quickly and undamaged.  And prices are usually less than most other places.</li>
    <li> For over 30 years, I&#x27;ve been hopelessly loyal to Norelco; however, when I purchased their latest iteration I was sadly disappointed.  So I started shopping.  After reading tons of mostly positive reviews, I decided to take a gamble and purchase the Braun Series 7-790cc, it&#x27;s relatively high price nothwithstanding.  Glad I did!  Adios Norelco.</li>
    <li> This shaver is very disappointing in its performance. One has to go over and over to get a decent shaving.  Its performance is quite poor in the neck area as the surface is not leveled.  Above all, it is excessively overpriced and hence I won&#x27;t recommend this to anyone at the current market price, $ 239.00.</li>
    <li> I bought it because of the great reviews from others here on Amazon. I wanted The Best -- and a fast shave -- but disappointed:&lt;br /&gt;- Shaving is slow&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s loud&lt;br /&gt;- The cleaning cycle is loud&lt;br /&gt;- Why do I need auto-cleaning? Sounded nice, but pointless. You spend more time managing the auto-cleaning parts&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s unnecessarily complex -- too many buttons, options, etc.&lt;br /&gt;- The charging/cleaning unit is bulky&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going back to my simple, reliable Norelco... takes just as long to shave, none of all the complex junk</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several electric shavers over the years and they all were disappointing in some way. Poor quality shaves, pinched, pain to clean, something. Not this unit. Great shave, very comfortable. Feels good in my hand, great control.</li>
    <li> Razor consistently pulls the whiskers rather than cutting them cleanly.  Very disappointed with the performance of the razor.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Whatever happened to planned obsolescence? I bought this shaver almost seven years ago and it still performs beautifully, just as it did the day I took it out of its box back in April 2009. Yes, I&#x27;ve kept it clean, running it in its base almost every time I use it, and yes, I&#x27;ve replaced the head once (Braun says every three years but I&#x27;ve gone four, I think). In return, it has continued to give me fast, clean, comfortable shaves. This is one of the best, most reliable products I&#x27;ve ever owned -- one of those products that&#x27;s a pleasure to use and own. Even the battery is great -- I used it on a three-week trip to Europe a little while ago and never needed to recharge it! Thanks, Braun, for a truly great product. Not cheap -- but worth every dollar!</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best shaver I have ever used. I can not believe how close close of a shave I get.  Also, it tells you how much shave cleaner you have left aand when it is empty.  It is not cheap, but WORTH EVERY PENNY.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical reading all the promotional material for this new shaver.  I&#x27;m 54 years old and have been using a razor all my life.  About a year ago, the razor started irritating my skin so I was forced to begin using a Norelco rotary electric shaver that I kept under the counter.  The results were far from satisfactory but at least it didn&#x27;t cause a rash on my face.  I figured that was just the nature of electric shavers and was convinced that I would be living with a scratchy, stubbly beard the rest of my life.  Then I read a review on this new Pulsonic shaver in the August 2007 issue of Popular Mechanics magazine.  It sparked my interest so I researched it more on the internet.  I finally decided to take a chance and purchase the highly acclaimed but expensive shaver.    I&#x27;ve been using it now for one month and am convinced that it is not possible for an electric shaver to work better than this one.  I&#x27;t leaves the Norelco rotary in the dust.  I would say it shaves about 97% as close as a regular lather &amp; razor shave.  It does not leave stubbles and it isn&#x27;t necessary to shave more than once a day.  Yes, it takes a small investment to purchase this shaver but it is a quality item that you can live with for life.    The self-cleaning charger/holder requires replacement cleaning fluid cartriges periodically.  The information I read says that a cartrige is good for about a month.  However, the razor head can also be cleaned by rinsing it under hot water...which is what I do for two days and then run it through the complete cleaning cycle every third day.  After a month doing this the original cartrige still says \\&quot;FULL\\&quot;.  I have purchased three more cartriges for $16.  I think those will last me for a very long time.    I have nothing bad to say about this shaver after having recovered from the shock of the initial purchase price.  You get what you pay for and you will certainly pay for this one.  I don&#x27;t regret spending the money for this shaver at all.</li>
    <li> I have had this shaver for about 2 weeks. I previously used the Braun 8995 and used Brauns for many years previous to that. This is the best one yet. It provides as close to a real blade shave as you can get. It&#x27;s appearance could hardly be improved upon.  The trimmer is different than previous models in that it pops out at a 90 degree angle  to the razor. It takes a while to get used to that but it will seem natural after a while. The head when pulled off looks  complex compared to previous models and I guess that is because it cuts in two directions. I have no idea what a replacement will cost but I assume from looking  at it that it want be cheap. The head/cutter assembly  according to the manual should last 18 months. One thing missing from this shaver  is a plastic head cover which I would like to have. I could not find it as an accessory and I do not know why they no longer provide one. On this shaver you press  a button to turn on and off which has  a continuous blue light. When not in use you can store it in the charger/cleaner which is an off white color and provides you with a lot  of information.  The shaver has  an LCD that provides  you with how much charge is left and how dirty your shaving head is so you know when to clean it.  I do not clean mine every day but do blow it out with the head off. I usually clean it at least once a week.  They have changed the formula for the cleaning fluid but your old container of cleaning fluid still fits the new cleaner.  The shaver head is washable.  You will also receive a small container  of oil for the head if you ever feel the desire to oil  it. The shaver can be run  with the cord only. You can also do a \\&quot;quick\\&quot; clean on your cleaner/charger. This razor feels comfortable in your hand and the head follows  the contours of you neck and face very nicely. You can lock the head in one position but I never have found the need.  It is not cheap.  I found no discounts on this shaver. I like it!</li>
    <li> I have a thick, dark beard... even when I shave with a blade you can see the outline of where my beard will be when it grows in.  I tend to look like I haven&#x27;t shaved even when I have.  I have gone through several electric razors that did ok.  Generally, I would use the electrics every other day.  If I tried to go more than 2 days in a row they usually just couldn&#x27;t handle it.  When my last one died I decided to try to buy a \\&quot;good\\&quot; electric and see if it really was better than the average ones I&#x27;d been using.  I chose wisely.  The braun is the first electric razor that I can use every day.  Is it as close as a blade... with me no.  It&#x27;s not, but it&#x27;s awfully close.  It handles the curve from my chin to my neck and does a very good job.  I have never been disappointed with it in terms of shaving performance.  The fluid you buy to use the self-cleaning \\&quot;dock\\&quot; is fairly expensive and it goes through it pretty quickly.  I kind of wish you could just buy the stuff to refill the cartridges.  (If I knew what it was you probably could.)  On the whole though, this razor performs.  I&#x27;ve used a blade once in the two years or so that I&#x27;ve owned it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait until i had this for a few months before reviewing it. Let me just say before i get started.... basics... you can&#x27;t use an electric shaver one time and say it is no good, that is not how electric shavers work. You have to use it for a week or two and your beard will get used to how it is being cut. Only then can you make an educated evaluation. Ok that is off my chest.... I had been using a refurbed Braun Syncro 755 for the last 7 years and it has performed admirably, but it was loud and the battery started only holding a charge for 1 shave (this is after 7yrs and with a refurb!). So naturally i wanted to get another Braun.... it took me some time to finally spend the money on this one but I&#x27;m so glad i did. It is unbelievable..... I can&#x27;t wait to shave in the morning.... I&#x27;m not kidding, it is quiet and the cleaning,charging station is really, really nice. I have a fresh shaver everytime i use it. It shaves me very close. It is so smooth... I also recently took it on vacation and i used it every day for 8 days and even though i brought my charger with me, i never needed it. I didnt&#x27; take the charging/cleaning station (obviously), but the shaver comes with a hard plastic case with a small brush that fits in the end to help you clean it. You can also run water over the end i guess, to clean it if you want, but i won&#x27;t be doing that. All i can say is if you have used an electric shaver before and are looking to get another one.... don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this one. I think it is well worth the money.  Jan 4th, 2012... I have owned this shaver for almost 2 years now and I must say I still think it is the best electric shaver I have ever used.....</li>
    <li> I would have given this shaver 4.5 stars just on good shave-ability alone but couldn&#x27;t find a way to do that. A minor annoyance is the trimmer which is only useful for trimming sideburns. If you want to touch up a goatee or moustache it&#x27;s pretty much useless. The older model shaver that I&#x27;m retiring for this one had a much better design. Overall I recommend this shaver, but have to admit that it is pricey.</li>
    <li> Base stops working right after 2 months of use. Braun won&#x27;t just send replacement, advise you to mail it in for repairs (with original receipt) or take it to &#x27;licensed service center (also with original receipt). Complete pain. For a $200+ shaver they should just send replacement. Or it shouldn&#x27;t break in the first place.</li>
    <li> The shaver works fairly well, and I love how the device cleans itself with the cleaner unit. I could be wrong having not experienced a new shaver in a long time, but I expected a closer shave, especially in the neck area. When I feel my face after the shave, it feels close, but I can still see some beard imbedded in my skin. However, I can still feel some beard on my neck area. Maybe it was just the particular shaver that I received and not the usual performance of the Braun Series 7-790cc Pulsonic shaver. Craig.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one to rave about a product but this thing exceeded my expectations by a mile. Shaving with it feels like moving a spoon across your face, it&#x27;s that comfortable.  I have had several high end Norelco&#x27;s which always irratate my skin and left lot&#x27;s of stubble unless you pressed hard and moved it in little circles the whole time.  I had to plan on shaving a day ahead for healing time for the rash and reddness to go away if I had an important meeting. It is noisier then my other electrics but it&#x27;s a pleaseant hum.  A first class product that shaves about 90% as close as a blade.</li>
    <li> Been a Braun user for 20 years. If I shave at 5am, I need to shave again at 12 noon. Not so with this unit. It shaves as close as a blade. The pulse system helps keep the blades from \\&quot;pinching\\&quot; your hair and makes it easy to get close without trying. All other Braun razor&#x27;s can&#x27;t come close to this unit, the 360, etc. The blade system on this thing is amazing.     Braun added a 25sec \\&quot;quick clean\\&quot; which works great, not need to \\&quot;intensive\\&quot; clean it every day.    Had it for 2 weeks and I can&#x27;t find a single thing to complain about but the price. But, Bed Bath Beyond had it for around $275.00! So it is a great deal here at amazon.</li>
    <li> lco Remington wet/dry electric razor was getting some age on it and I decided it was time to look for a replacement.  Not being very happy with the save I was getting with the rotary design, I decided to start looking at foil shavers.  Everywhere I looked, the Braun 9595CC kept popping up with overall good reviews.  I was not happy about the $214.00 price tag.  However, I knew it would take a serious shaver to tackle my thick, dark haired beard (My 5 O&#x27;Clock shadow started at 2:00).  Reluctantly, I placed an order through one of the vendors here on Amazon and ordered a replacement pack [[ASIN:B000YL8M1E Braun CCR2 Pulsonic, Syncro, Activator, Flex XP, 360 Complete shaver cleaner refill]] of the cleaning solutions. After two days of not hearing anything, I got an email simply saying my order was cancelled.  Not being pleased, I reordered through Dependable Resource and it arrived quickly.  Upon arrival, I unpackaged the shaver and quickly set it up for a full-charge.  It looked and felt very well built and fit my hand very well.  I&#x27;ve now got three shaves under it and I am totally impressed!  Shave 1:  I shaved without Williams&#x27; Lectric Shave applied first and I got good results, with slight stubble on my neck.  Shaves 2 and 3:  I applied Lectric Shave first and got shaves equivalent to my Sensor.  Locking the shaver head seemed to help with getting my neck area really well.  Little to no stubble is left.  It turns out the shaver does live up to its hype.  This shaver will be a keeper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1.  VERY close shave, as good as a blade razor for my face.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Pop-Up trimmer works very well around my sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Cleaner works very well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1.  It&#x27;s still expensive!&lt;br /&gt;2.  The shaver is a little noisy but who cares?&lt;br /&gt;3.  It may become a pain to buy the refill cartridges for the cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;4.  The cleaner is noisy when running.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommed the shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1-2-08 UPDATE-I continue to be impressed with how well the 9595 works.  It has functioned flawlessly.  My face has further adapted to the new razor and shaves even closer.  I use Lectric Shave before each save to soften up my beard.  I noticed in family photos over Christmas, I no longer had a dark \\&quot;shadow\\&quot; on my face from my beard.  The cleaner has finally given me a \\&quot;Low\\&quot; light telling me it&#x27;s time to replace the cartridge.  The pop-up sideburn trimmer is great for hitting my ears and sideburn area.  I will be a loyal Braun customer from this point on based on my success with the 9595.ly.  My face has further adapted to the new razor and shaves even closer.

    <li> Great product.  I tried the pulsonic first.  Then was curious about the arcitec, so I ordered it.  I sent the arcitec back as fast as it came in.  That thing was awful for many reasons.  Way too over priced.  Go with the pulsonic.</li>
    <li> Well, everything that is said about this razor is true.  Very impressive and instead of me just repeating all the good things about this razor, check out this page  [...]     Note:  The 9595 and the 9585 models are essentially the same.</li>
    <li> I normally use Electric razors in the $40 range, My old one was acting up and biased on reviews here and from a friend I got this. It&#x27;s nothing like the $40 electric ones. This thing gave me the closest shave I have ever had. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> I purchased the shaver on May 30, 2010 based on reviews here and at other sites. So far, each time I use it, it works better and better. I haven&#x27;t used electric shavers (Norelco and Panasonic) for 30 years because they pulled and didn&#x27;t get close enough. Not so with the Braun. Each shave is closer than the last and I&#x27;ve experienced no pulling, irritation, or burn. Also, based on reviews, I purchased the Afta Pre-Electric shave lotion. Although I am not fond of the smell, it&#x27;s not overpowering and it works well. The shaver is a little noisy during the cleaning cycle and takes some getting used to. I am very happy with the shaver.</li>
    <li> FROM THE START I LOVED IT SHAVED ME CLOSER THAN ANY RAZOR I EVER HAD BUY ONE YOU WILL LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> I have had Braun shavers before but this is the best.  Gives a very close shave and does it quickley even in the hard to shave places on the neck.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Remington Titanium razor for the last 5 years (give or take a year), and before that a Norelco rotary razor. Both of those were gifts.    I was never satisfied with the Norelco, as the heads seemed to wear quite fast and when they got dull, it really pulled. The Remington I&#x27;ve had for a while. It&#x27;s battery is starting to go. So why didn&#x27;t I buy another Remington? Well, the razors inside the head needed replacing every 6 months, though, sometimes I could get 9 months out of them (and this last one has lasted for over a year, but then again, I haven&#x27;t been shaving as much--more on that in this review). Also, this razor is messy! Hair gets all over the place; my wife hates it ;). And it&#x27;s very loud; it actually sounds like a mulch machine/branch chipper!     Another frustrating thing about the two other razors I&#x27;ve used: the Norelco was not cordless; the Remington was cordless, but if the battery died, you couldn&#x27;t plug it into the wall and use it. If you turned on the razor while it was plugged in, it would stop charging, and hence, would not power the razor. With the Remington, I found that I needed to buy that special face powder to make the shaving go better, but that also was ever more messy (now you&#x27;ve got hair AND powder everywhere).    I just got the Braun yesterday. It seems to solve all my problems: a close shave (a bit closer than the Remington), it can be plugged in and used if the battery dies, it&#x27;s very clean (doesn&#x27;t leak much hair during shaving and has a self-cleaning system), and, contrary to another review, is MUCH quieter than the Remington. Today, it did pull at my beard a bit, BUT, I haven&#x27;t shaved in four days AND I just got it--it&#x27;s quite possible my beard needs to get used to it yet. Should I continue to have any problems, I&#x27;ll update this review.    A couple of other things to note: the shaving head won&#x27;t need replacing for approx. 18 months! WOW! I used to spend $35 every 6. Now I&#x27;ll spend $40 - $45 every 18! That&#x27;s a savings of $60-$65/year. Of course, there are the cleaning cartridges, which are $19 ea. (or a [[ASIN:B001S2J5DW 12-pack]] for $60 here on Amazon.com). Now, most people say that they last longer than 30 shaves, and if you only shave every other day, you may even stretch them to last 60 days or more--so it really depends.    So far, this thing is great. I love it, and better yet, my wife loves it, too.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product. Does not pull or nick. Works incredibly. Closest Shave Ever. Superior to razor. Easy to clean. Comfortable to use. Buy it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> OK I wanted this to be a success, I had just spent $200 on a shaver....it had better be good. This is the first review I have written on anything!    First the history....I am 52, I had not been a shaver until 5 years ago, always had a beard etc....any way when I decided to start shaving I tried a few electric razors...all useless and eventually got used to wet shaving....what a drag, always making sure you have foam and blades, and standing in the shower shaving for a few minutes was just a drag.....anyway, went to get heads for my favorite wet razor....they were out could not get.....what a PITA.....so lets try an electric again...read the reviews etc....this one looked good, but over $200...    Razor came yesterday, looked very neat, but they should coordinate the colors more, charged it up, very quick, couple of hours and it was done, switched it on, much quieter than the older ones I had tried, did one side of face, actually liked the slight vibration....wow, it felt smooth, did rest of face, head followed contours of chin and neck really well....I was very impressed, as was my wife who was VERY dubious. Only issue I have is that overnight the stubble grew back quicker, so it is obiously not as close as a wet shave....but for the conveience, it is pretty dam good.....oh! and it cleans itself....but that seems a little noisey, so if you have a master bath as we do, dont set it to clean just before you go to bed to sleep!!!</li>
    <li> just got it for Christmas, wish I had it a few weeks ago for my vasectomy! I&#x27;ve been hacking away at the growth with an old norelco lift and cut, (more of a yank and bleed) This razor is great! cuts 3 day old scruff in one pass. The charger stand is a bit bulky, but that&#x27;s because it holds a resivior of cleaning fuild. There is a hygene meter that lets you know when to clean it. The only drawback is how loud it is. Something to do with the pulsonic part, but when you use the trimmer to zap them sideburns you might as well be sittin next to the speaker at a bread concert.</li>
    <li> I had the previous braun model and since it did not shave \\&quot;as close as a blade\\&quot;  I decided to try the pulsonic.  It does shave as well as a blade, BUT it takes  some practice.  Positioning of the head (angle to the face) is crucial and you  must move slowly -- give it time to vibrate the hairs and cut them.  In this regard,  it takes a little longer to shave, but the end result is better.  It is   very comfortable.  The cleaning system is excellent and highly recommended.  It seems to hold the charge longer and this with the ability to rinse under water  makes it far better for travel.  Nice travel case as well.  Recommend.</li>
    <li> I had been using a Braun Synchro for 3 years prior to buying the Pulsonic. Before that I had tried many brands and was primarily a blade shaver. The Synchro was the best electric I had ever used. The new Pulsonic is a 100% improvement. It shaves in 2/3 the time and gives a decidedly closer and more comfortable shave. Quite impressive when a new product really lives up to the advertising.</li>
    <li> I have owned Braun Shavers for years and this one takes some getting &#x27;used&#x27; too.....it is VERY noisey in its cleaning mode due to the pulsonic system, the &#x27;idiot&#x27; lights on the shaver itself are pretty useless since they adjust automatically and not really to weather the shaver is &#x27;dirty&#x27;, but the darn thing works on your face and works well.   I do wish they had kept it black instead of this off white, but overall, it beats Norelco and for those who want to spend $200 (not to mention the replaceable washing elements) you might want to give it a try.  I am a Braun fan and this is probably the best electric shaver now on the market.</li>
    <li> My husband thrilled with this X Gift, in two weeks he has perfect shave in least amount of time, still raves about it. This is the one to get for heavy bearded people</li>
    <li> I love the razor, best I have ever had (previously used various Norelco&#x27;s). But Braun customer service is incredibly bad (is P&amp;G in the US), and even worse considering the price of the razor. After about a year of use the cleaning mechanism stopped working. Called Braun, they said send into a repair place. Repair place said they needed my razor. So three weeks with a crappy battery razor I bought ($30). Then in Jan the cleaning mechanism stopped working again. Called Braun, they said send back to repair place, I told them they were kidding. As a great favor they said they would send me a new cleaning unit. Two months and many phone calls later, nothing. (They gave me a Fedex tracking number for an address in another state). After telling me that normally I would have to deal with Fedex, they said as a special favor I could buy a new cleaning unit (which I did in Feb.) and they would reimburse me. Many more phone calls, check is in the mail. So In May I called and told them I was going to write a very bad review unless I got a check within a week. Four days later a check showed up. Now in early August the new cleaning mechanism stops working. Pretty bad. I have not the energy to fight with Braun again, and would love to keep using the Braun which I like, but alas my apt. plumbing cannot deal with cleaning out the hair in the sink. So if you think you are buying a premium product with premium service from Braun, think again. The razor has been great, but would not go near anything where customer service is P&amp;G again. I will now have to search for an inferior razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update March 2012 - the locking mechanism to hold the head in place broke. Alas, I need this for any longish hairs. Hard to shave with one hand holding the head in place. So finally bye bye to the Braun, which lasted just about 4 years (possibly not horrible in today&#x27;s world, but hardly what I expected for the price of the razor). I am hoping the new Phillips is better.</li>
    <li> The Braun 9595 is without peer in the electric shaver market.  I have used electrics for years because blades just tear though my sensitive face.  Granted, it took about two weeks of use before my face adjusted to the closeness of the shave the 9595 gave, but now it is a dream to use.    Using my old electrics, it would take me at least 5 minutes to get an acceptable shave.  With the 9595, I&#x27;m now usually done in less than two minutes and the shave quality is far better than I ever got with any shaver I used before.  The 9595 works incredibly well for me given I have whiskers growing in many directions on my face.  The head of the unit easily maneuvers around my chin line and cheeks, it is comfortable in my hand and the pop-up hair trimmer is handy for touchups to my moustache and goatee.    One word of warning on this razor.  The cut on it is so close, I drew blood on my adams apple the first few times I used it.  There is a learning curve with this razor.  However, I now know to gently brush over my adams apple and I haven&#x27;t had this issue ever since.    Final verdict - the absolute best of all electrics at this time!</li>
    <li> I have used a Braun shaver for several years now and have liked it much better than any other electric shaver I have tried. I recently got the new Braun Pulsonic for Xmas. It is absolutely the best shaver ever. It gives me the smoothest/closest shave with zero razor burn. It shaves faster and quieter than even my older Braun. The automatic cleaning and charging is simple. I recommend the Pulsonic for anyone that wants the best shave possible.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor since Sept. 2007.  I do not receive a shave  that is equal to the $200.00+ that I paid.  Areas along the jaw-line and on my neck require many passes and it still may leave hairs.  The repeated passes can cause skin irritation which is also unacceptable.  On top of this if I get too close to my sideburns it has a tendency to rip 1 or 2 out.  I thought the \\&quot;little fingers\\&quot; were supposed to raise close lying hairs so the cutters could cut them.  This doesn&#x27;t happen for me.  I&#x27;ve tried \\&quot;electric shave\\&quot; and Remington&#x27;s shaving stick to reduce the irritation but neither has eleminated the problem.  I do like the fact that you can rinse the razor, but this doesn&#x27;t count as a cleaning so you still have to use the cleaning unit.  I also think the charge doesn&#x27;t last as long as other shavers I&#x27;ve owned.    In my opinion the razor is made from cheap material.  An example is when pushing the button to release the head mine clicks really hard like its breaking.  I&#x27;ve noticed that only one side releases unless my finger is centered precisely on the button.  Shouldn&#x27;t be happening with something this expensive.  Second example is my lock button broke last week.  I can no longer lock the head.  It wasn&#x27;t comforting to hear the guy at the Service Center say \\&quot;Wow, haven&#x27;t heard of that happening before, I&#x27;m not sure how to fix it, guess I&#x27;ll have to order a head from the company.\\&quot;  Then he asked \\&quot;do you have another razor?  It&#x27;ll take 10-15 days to get the part from the company.\\&quot;  I&#x27;m heading overseas in a couple of weeks, I don&#x27;t think this razor is making the trip.  Its pretty though, anyone that uses my bathroom usually comes out saying \\&quot;dang man that razor is awesome.\\&quot;  If they only knew.</li>
    <li> After 50 years of trying every model of Norelco made, I finally found a shaver that does what I want it to. This is the finest electric shaver ever built. Highly recommended to others. The self-cleaning feature works perfectly. The shave is the closest I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> This shaver works well, but not so well that it justifies the hefty price tag that goes along with it.  I was using a Braun Synchro electric razor before and that worked just as well.  This shaver does give quite a close shave, but I was hoping that you would have to go over an area just once as they claim and not many many times at different angles similar to other electric razors.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for forty years, but based on other reviews I&#x27;ve read I decided to give the Pulsonic a try.  The vibration takes some getting used to (one wonders if they didn&#x27;t start calling the problem of high noise levels a feature), but it does shave extremely close--close enough that I get razor burn that I never had with my Norelco.      Another noticeable thing is that the screens get quite warm during operation.  Don&#x27;t know if this will reduce as the screens and cutters wear in (I&#x27;ve only had mine a month) or not.  I did find that I had to change my shaving pattern to a more linear one than I was used to, since the Norelco cuts equally well in any direction, but having done so, the Pulsonic&#x27;s pivoting head tracks the shape of my face very well.      I also found that I had to change the way I shaved around the corners of my mouth and under my nose.  Norelcos cut right up to the edge of their heads, but there is a big dead zone at the ends of the Braun&#x27;s heads that doesn&#x27;t cut.  As a result, you can&#x27;t use the corner of the head to shave into the opening of your nostrils or the ends of your mouth; you have to use the middle of the head, which is less convenient.    The Pulsonic cleaning system is handy, although it takes up a lot of room on the counter, and there&#x27;s the extra cost of buying cleaning cartridges. It&#x27;s probably worth it, however, for people who never remember to clean their shaver.     Finally, this was the most over packaged product I have ever seen, with a molded plastic shell (inside a cardboard box, which was inside a cardboard sleeve, which was inside a plastic box) held together by little buttons that were so confusing they had to put an instruction sticker in the box describing how to get it open.  Some German engineer got entirely too carried away with the package design, which probably contributed to the unit&#x27;s high price.</li>
    <li> I have been using Electric razors ever since I started shaving (about 35 years ago I hate to say!). The Pulsonic is by far the best I have ever used. Years ago I shaved with Remingtons and then when my father told me about Panasonic I switched to their units and have been pleased for years. I was reluctant to switch to the Braun Pulsonic as until it went on sale it was very expensive, I thought the cleaning system would be a pain to use, and I was still happy with my Panasonic razor. When I saw the Pulsonic on sale and read a few reviews a few months ago I bought one. This razor shaves closer and more comfortably than any other I have tried and the cleaning system is easy to use and awesome. What I have found works best is to shower first and then use a pre-electric lotion such as Afta Pre-Electric. I clean the razor after each use--very simply by placing it back in the storage unit. This is not only convenient, but I don&#x27;t clog up my sink any more by cleaning it there. The only downside to this razor is the pop-up trimmer which is not as good as Panasonic&#x27;s. I still use the Panasonic for the pop up trimmer only because I still own it. Otherwise the Pulsonic&#x27;s trimmer would be sufficient.</li>
    <li> This is my third Braun shaver, having just recently upgraded from a Braun Synchro (which also has the automatic cleaning function).  The pulsonic gives a slightly better shave and has some neat features, but is no miracle shaver.  I am happy with it, but wouldn&#x27;t have spent $200 to upgrade if I knew what I know now.  Instead, I would either have kept my Synchro or tried the 360 which has many of the same features as the Pulsonic (but no ultra-sonic pulses -- see the lawsuit as to whether this is worth anything).    If you are switching from a blade, you will definitely not get as close a shave.  If you are switching from another Braun, you will probably get a better shave, but probably not $200 better.    Pros:  A closer shave; cleaning base works very well; ability to wash the shaver head with plain water when necessary.  The cleaning base is nice but I recommend only cleaning every few days to preserve the fluid.  The new blade design (also a feature of the 360) does a better job of slicing the hair vice chopping it and causes less irritation than my synchro did.  Cons:  Only marginally better than my synchro and probably not much better than the 360.  Shaver head and cutter block are all one piece and have to be replcaed all at once (about $40).  Finally, price.  A nice looking shaver but it just doesn&#x27;t provide a $200 shave.    Overall, a good shaver.  If I didn&#x27;t know the pricetag, I would be very happy with it.</li>
    <li> After just one shave with this razor I am completely sold on the Braun Pulsonic.  I used to have a Braun 360 Complete but stopped using it because I was not satisfied with the results.  I was a little hesitant to try again, but you get tired of using a razor, purchasing expensive blades and messy shaving cream so I took the leap once again.  It is worth the extra dollars to purchase this unit over the Braun 360 Complete.  Extremely close shave.  I did find a much lower price from iKitchen but DO NOT DEAL WITH THEM!  They  sat on my order for 14 days (which it states in the fine print, but I figured that would never happen).  iKitchen sat on the order because they don&#x27;t stock anything and they figured they could buy it cheaper and re-sell. I waited two weeks to  try and save $60.   Well now their price is the same as AMAZON.  I bet iKitchen could ship it now because it&#x27;s the same price. iKitchen is a loser!  Buy from Amazon, you won&#x27;t regret it.  This is an excellent shaver.</li>
    <li> This shaver works faster than a blade, yes faster, and actually gets a clean shave, with basically no burn on very very sensitive skin, like mine. Unlike most electric razors it actually gives you a shave that doesn&#x27;t leave gaps. If you have sensitive skin and can afford it I wouldn&#x27;t recommend any other shaver. Easily worth the price. Best shaver I ever used.</li>
    <li> Great product. Gives the closest shave of any electric shaver I have ever tried.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver back in August when it came out.  I was really interested in seeing how well it performed based on how happy everyone was with the product.  I have owned quite a few Braun shavers and to be honest I really don&#x27;t care for this one.  I have very soft skin so my beard comes in light at some parts under my neck.  I just finished shaving and the shaver was actually running hot.  I really wanted to like this product a lot but I guess it might work better on certain type of beards</li>
    <li> Great Christmas present. My boyfrieend loves it and tells me it works well and cleans itself. Cleaning refills are only $12 for two. Worth spending a little extra money on.</li>
    <li> Have used it for about two weeks.  Shaves well but still need to go over same spot several times depending upon location.  Can use it with cord when needed.  Haven&#x27;t used the sideburn cutter yet. Look and feel of shaver is great.  THERE IS NO PLASTIC COVER to protect the foil!! Other reviewers pointed this out as well.  Not too smart on Braun&#x27;s part. Overall, I&#x27;d purchase it again despite no cover, but I&#x27;m reminded of the protective plastic cover issue everytime I try to find a safe place to set it down after each use (I&#x27;m in a ongoing battle for space in the bathroom!!).  Also, its only been two weeks so if that foil eventually does get damaged for lack of cover, I&#x27;d say don&#x27;t buy it!!    My previous Braun model was top of the line from 10 years ago.  Its battery is losing the ability to hold a charge so I decided to buy another top of the line from Braun.  From my viewpoint, the main difference between the new and the old, is that the new one can cut closer than the old one.      10 years ago, to remedy the problem of not getting a close cut with the Braun, I also purchased the top of line for Panasonic.  For 10 years I&#x27;ve used the Braun for the first shave, and then finished with the Panasonic for the close shave.  Pansonic couldn&#x27;t cut long hair well, but cut very well the short hair.  It looks like I won&#x27;t have to purchase the Panasonic this time since the new Braun seems to cut close enough.      I gave this product 5 stars, but remember I&#x27;m rating this without consideration of longevity and the sideburn cutter.  If it is working well after five years like my previous Braun, then it should get 10 stars!!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product!    A great purchase and ease of service with Amazon</li>
    <li> This is a very solid choice if you&#x27;re looking for an foil electric razor. The build quality is excellent - solidly made, and feels very substantial. The cleaning base is undoubtably the best out there - it&#x27;s the first cleaning base I&#x27;ve used that actually does the job better and faster than cleaning it yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, you buy a razor for the shave quality, and on that mark, the Pulsonic is just a bit above average. On the plus side, it&#x27;s very gentle and works quickly. The downside is that it does not give me as close as a shave as I get from a Norelco Arcitec. The pulsonic action helps out somewhat with those hard to cut neck hairs, but on my face, the Arcitec does a better job, and does it faster and quieter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve used a Braun 360 or other similar Braun shavers and have been pleased with it, then this would be a very nice upgrade. Also, if you find you get a good shave from other foil shavers, such as the Remingtons, then you&#x27;ll probably like this as well. It will be a clear step up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you favor a rotary shaver, then you probably will not be happy with the closeness of the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tough part is if you&#x27;ve never used an electric shaver before and have nothing to compare it to. In that case, I&#x27;d suggest getting the Pulsonic and the Arcitec, and seeing which works best for you. Every face is different - some beards (like mine) are better suited to a rotary; others are better suited to a foil. All razor manufacturers let you try out their products for at least 30 days (60 for Norelco). If you don&#x27;t like it, you can return it to the manufacturer and get your money back. Yes, you&#x27;ll be out of pocket for the postage to mail it back, but you can be assured you&#x27;re getting the right razor for your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it three stars based on how well it worked for me. If you&#x27;re a foil fan, this can easily be a five-star product.</li>
    <li> This shaver will not substitute for a blade shave, but does better than some previous razors on this 69 year old face.   One feature missing is a trimmer.   Not much difference between this screen type of shaver and a rotary shaver for closeness.   The innovative recharging base offers a change with the automatic cleaning the razor by flushing a solution through the heads after each use, which will require occasional purchasing of CCR refills for the cleaner.   It also may be cleaned in the normal methods as well.   Overall, it does allow for a faster shave without the lathering mess of a blade, but don&#x27;t expect a real close shave.</li>
    <li> Of all the shavers I have used, this one is the greatest.  The shave is close and smooth.  It gets to all parts of my face, is comfortable to use and the cleaning system does a very good job.  While it may cost more then most shavers, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for years now and it works wonderfully. I get a very close shave.</li>
    <li> Because of a medical restriction, I had to invest in an electric razor to use in place of my normal blade shave. I had tried an electric razor some time ago with terrible results. This Braun razor has changed my mind. It is very close to the results you would get from a blade. I especially like the digital display at the bottom of the razor that shows how much battery life is left before you will need to recharge it. It also has a hygiene scale so that you know when it needs to be run through a cleaning cycle, in the cleaning/charging unit.</li>
    <li> The Braun Pulsonic System 9595 delivered exceptional performance as promised with no exceptions. Everything worked great including the cleaning system. The shave is quick, smooth and effortless. The design of the head ensures that all irregularly shaped areas of my face and neck are shaved smoothly the first time. I am very pleased that I selected this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver a few months ago with some doubt that it would be worth it.  Needless to say, I have not picked up a razor in several months!!!!  My face is smooth everyday with a quick shave.  The auto cleaning system is easy to use and does a great job.  I have had the shaver for 5 months and only changed the cleaning solution one time.    Great shaver, buy it at a great price and you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have owned/used Norelco rotary head razors for almost 20 years and have been relatively impressed (the latest being a Speed XL). After the reviews i read on the Braun, I thought I would give it a try.  I am VERY glad I did! The Braun has a significantly closer shave.  The Braun is a bit noisier, but it is a small trade-off for the reason you have the shaver.  I have no pulled hairs anymore with the Braun. And yes, I compared the Norelco with new heads to a new Braun.</li>
    <li> The new Braun Pulsonic is absolutely the best electric razor I have ever owned.  I thought my Panasonic was pretty good but not even close (no pun intended).  I still used a blade for my really close shaves but my face breaks out with constant use and only the first blade day is the best.  No need no more!  The Braun was close the first time and every time.  And being able to automatically clean itself is first class.  I totally recommend it.  Can&#x27;t think of anything negative.</li>
    <li> I have been using electric shavers since starting to shave at 14. I have  used every brand ever marketed starting with Schick,Sunbeam,Remington,  Norelco,and finally Braun,(my last 4 shavers). This Pulsonic model is so  superior to all the others I can hardly believe it! It&#x27;s a pleasure to  shave now.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd Braun, last one broke after a few years, head came loose and I decided not to send it in for repair.  While waiting for my new 9595 I used a 5 blade vibrating disposable with shaving gel so I have some recent experience to compare too.  I have owned the new razor for just over a week. Before my Brauns I used several Norelco&#x27;s.  My dad is still a die hard Norelco man, but he hasn&#x27;t tried my new Braun yet either :)    Speedwise the shave with a Braun 9595 is MUCH faster than the 7xxx series and works better when you have skipped a couple of days.  On my 7xxx series if I had missed more than a couple days then I would go back to a blade.  On the 9595 I have done 3 days no problem, but haven&#x27;t tried longer yet.  With the older Braun you either shaved or didn&#x27;t, the first pass didn&#x27;t come close to doing a good job vs with the new onea single pass isn&#x27;t bad at all.  The 9595 doesn&#x27;t pull hair near as much as the old one when you have skipped a couple days.  I really feel the 9595 is closer to a revolutionary upgrade than an evolutionary.    Compared to a blade (after have adjusted a bit since I used one for a few weeks) To me speed is about the same and the shave is about the same.  If I was in a hurry, I could get a passable shave faster with the Braun and not go over everything a 3rd time for the comparable shave.      In summary, Love it!</li>
    <li> I have used Braun shavers for over 15 years and I have loved them. Until now. After 4 years of great service my 7500 series Braun broke. With a track record like that, I was definitely buying another Braun.     I figured a razor is something I should spend extra on since I use it every day, so I bought the very pricey 9595. I have come to regret it. It became clear early on that this one wasn&#x27;t as good as the one that it replaced. After 3 months of daily use, I&#x27;m very frustrated and rather angry.     - Noise. The pulsonic razor is really noisy. Much noisier than the 7500 series.    - Recharger/cleaner is very poorly designed. Rather than using a direct plug in connection, it has contacts on the razor and on the base that need to line up. This works until the razor starts cleaning, vibrating the razor. This causes it to lose connection and stop working. It normally takes four tries to get it to complete a cleaning cycle. There is no correct way to insert the shaver to guarantee it will complete  cleaning cycle.     - Less information is less information. The old 7500 series told me how long the shave took and how much charge in minutes were left. The 9500 series has cell phone type bars for power and hygene, no read out on time taken to shave. After using this razor for 3 months, I think they removed the time taken to shave feature for a reason.     - Takes too long to get all the missed spots. It takes 50% longer to get a good shave than with the 7500 series.     - Excessive packaging. Packaging has no influence on those of us who buy through the Web, but I will note the packing is excessive and wasteful.     - Gimmicky. I have noticed no benefits of \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; over a regular electric razor.       After another time consuming shave and three attempts to get the razor to clean itself, I called customer service. They weren&#x27;t very nice and wanted me to ship the charger to another city. Thanks for nothing.     I have gone from a loyal Braun customer to someone who will never buy another Braun (or Proctor and Gamble marketed) electronic product.     Update: I still hate this razor and the shaves have gotten even worse. It takes forever to shave with this thing. It is the worst shaver I have had in 18 years of shaving. I can&#x27;t believe I paid over $200 for this POS.</li>
    <li> This is simply the best electric razor I have ever used.  It is worth the expense.</li>
    <li> I tried the Norelco shaver to keep my head shaved, but it did not work well.  I then tried the Braun Series 7 Pulsonic Shaver, and it did a very good job of both shaving my head (keeping it bald) and, shaving my face.  It is not quite as good as a blade when it comes to shaving your face, but it is much faster than the blade, and does an OK job.  In addition, one of the selling points for me was that you don&#x27;t have to bother cleaning the electric razor.  You just place it in its cradle and press the cleaning button, and it will automatically clean the razor and set it up again for your next shave.  Overall, it&#x27;s a very good product.  I recommend it for guys that want to keep their heads shaved.  (Suggestion:  Have your wife or girl friend help you with shaving the back of the head.  It is a lot easier than if you try to do it yourself.)</li>
    <li> Pleased with this shaver.  It is as good as my old Braun from 6 years ago.  The old one still worked, but I lost part of the power cord, so I figured I would treat myself to an new one.  Now I should buy a power cord for my old one so that I have a usable spare.  With regard to the 9595, I only wish it had a cover for the foil for bringing back and forth from my car.   Instead I have to use the travel case which makes it bulkier.   I would buy again.</li>
    <li> While the unit does run hot after a few minutes of use, I found that to be its&#x27; only flaw. It took about 3 weeks for my skin to get used to changing from a normal razor blade to this electric but now it shaves great. It isn&#x27;t as close and I have to shave every day, but overall its a great time saver; I often shave during the drive in to work.</li>
    <li> I have had the Pulsonic shaver for a year now. I love it! A smooth nick free shave every time. I&#x27;ve had a lot of shavers over the years and this one is by far the best one I have ever owned. As a matter of fact, I&#x27;ve just purchased one for my Son for Xmas.</li>
    <li> The product is fine....but I am not happy about paying $229.98 and now you are selling the product for $199.99......</li>
    <li> this is the best Braun yet...I&#x27;ve owned 4 over the last 12 years and this is by far the best.  the last one I owned was the 8595 360 and I thought this was good but this one is so much better...if you can buy it don&#x27;t hesitate just buy it you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!    Only con but with Amazon&#x27;s deal it was priced well.</li>
    <li> This item said that it gave a close shave and is supposed to be one of the best out there. My fiance tried it for 2-3 weeks like the box suggests but he still does not get a close shave. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband for Christmas. He has been shaving with a razor forever and decided to try an electric razor. This seemed the best product with the best reviews out there. He tried it twice and both times it would give a close shave in some patches but most spots(the neck) there was still stubble. He was disappointed that it was not as close a shave as using a razor. He wanted to return the product and just continue using his regular razor. We contacted Amazon and they said we couldn&#x27;t return it because it had been used at least once, well, this was a 200$ product so we then had to go and sell it on Ebay to get back some of our money.   Needless to say this was an expensive try at shaving with an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant with this razor at first, thinking with this price if I don&#x27;t like it i will have wasted my money.  This razor though is as close the fusion razor blades.  It was amazing that it was so close, and even better it didn&#x27;t rip my face off either like some Remington models.  Braun puts a lot of research and effort behind their razors and it really shows with this Series 7.  The only complaint i would have is that the battery last too long, i have used it for a week and just to see how the battery held up i didn&#x27;t charge it, and the damn thing won&#x27;t die.  There is a smart cleaning system that determines how hard it must clean in order to make the razor hygienic again without wasting cleaning fluid.  Overall this is one of the best razors i have ever had, I love it and I would not trade it in for anything else.  Oh yea, did i mention it will tell you when to change the foil and razors, cause it does that too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a Norelco guy.  I made the switch to this razor because it seemed Norelco&#x27;s quality control has dropped off.  I absolutely love this razor.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but the cleaning systems works very well, is fairly quiet, and turns itself off after the cleaning is done.</li>
    <li> the 7000 is smooth and cool and does a good job on my 47 year old face. The only thing, I prefer the older pop up trimmer not the pop out trimmer on the 7000 model</li>
    <li> Using a razor has never been an option for me.  I first began shaving as a kid when I joined the Army, and I quickly discovered the realities of pseudofolliculitis.  A shaving profile and a decent beard trimmer soon became a part of my standard-issue toiletry kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After leaving the military, I discovered electric shavers which cut closer, but still could not provide the professional kind of shave that I always wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years I&#x27;ve used a number of brands until about 15 years ago when I discovered Braun and thought I was in heaven.  Never has any electric shaver provided as close or as smooth a shave.  But paying a premium price for their product was a tough call for me, so eventually I sacrificed close shaves in favor of economics and went back to using the \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot; brands--what a disappointment though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then about a month ago, I bought the 790cc Pulsonic Shaver.  It provides the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  Almost as close as the razor shave I had on my first day of basic training.  So close, in fact, that I truly don&#x27;t believe Braun can improve on it.  Right now, I can actually skip a day of shaving and get away with it, but I don&#x27;t because I enjoy the feel of its ergonomic design, the efficiency of its \\&quot;uber-high frequency\\&quot; pulse and the high-tech \\&quot;coolness\\&quot; of the self-cleaning, self-sanitizing system.  It&#x27;s very 21st century.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re going to pay top dollar for this system, but it&#x27;s well worth it because there is no closer or safer electric shaver on the market.  And if your face is sensitive like mine then what are you waiting for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am skeptical, however, of Braun&#x27;s claim that the shaving block only has to be changed once every 18 months.  I think once every six months is more realistic, but we&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as cleaning is concerned, I put the shaver back in the cradle at the end of each shave and use the automatic cleaning cycle that the system recommends.  And why not?  That way I know the blades will be sanitized, lubricated and ready for the next morning&#x27;s session with a minimum of effort and thought on my part.  Replacement cleaning/lubricating fluid cartridges are cheap (through Amazon.com), and they make maintaining your investment a piece of cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE, Nov. 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until two weeks ago when I retired, I was still using this work horse.  It continues to give the closes shaves of my life.  I ultimately began changing the shaving blocks once each year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed about 18 months ago that the red light indicating the status of the cleaning/lubricating fluid began to come on too soon.  I finally put the recharger/cradle under the faucet and washed out the insides very thoroughly.  I found a lot of hair shavings had clogged-up the workings which caused it to give premature readings.  It worked like new once I had done this.  I recommend you do the same every year, and you save on cleaning/lubricating fluid.he blades will be sanitized, lubricated and ready for the next morning&#x27;s session with a minimum of effort and thought on my part.

    <li> I have had a few top of the line shavers from competitors and can say the Braun Series 7 so far is the closest, fastes shave of them all.</li>
    <li> ok i am not going to BS you i am going to tell you exactly what you want to hear &#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my girlfriend bought me the Philips Norelco arcitec 1060 and i had the Braun Flex XPII Shaver 5770 which i bought 7 years ago $80 and it was amazing . ok now you can see what i can compare with &#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1&#x3D; Philips Norelco arcitec 1060 it is made for people with big round face and not to much a face with bone structure because it cannot reach the angle of you jaw or on the middle of your throat at the adam&#x27;s apple ,so that was a problem with me because i am very fit and don&#x27;t have a big round face .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2&#x3D; Braun Flex XPII Shaver 5770 was almost perfect for me for the price i was very happy , but after 7 years even if i let the cord on when i was shaving ,it seemed to loose a bit of power so it was time to upgrade&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3&#x3D; Braun Series 7- 790cc is excellent ... it is exactly what i was expected to be for my 5770, pulsing at 10.000 rpm it sounds like a bee a little bit and is very very accurate on my jaw my throat and my face ...&lt;br /&gt;what i like or not&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros &#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very fast&lt;br /&gt;very accurate&lt;br /&gt;very quiet&lt;br /&gt;battery last minimum 9 days with no charge ???? yes .&lt;br /&gt;digital display of battery and hygiene on the bottom&lt;br /&gt;very light&lt;br /&gt;well made&lt;br /&gt;stands very good in your hand&lt;br /&gt;auto clean and re-sharpen machine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;flaws &#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;i wish when i turn on the shaver the digital&lt;br /&gt;display lights up to read better ,if you&lt;br /&gt;are in the dark little bit you cannot see it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and for the auto cleaning if you want my advise&lt;br /&gt;after the cycle keep the lid back on to save the liquid&lt;br /&gt;to evaporate and keep it longer ... personally everyday&lt;br /&gt;i shave i open the top and rinse it under hot water&lt;br /&gt;and once every 10 days i do the cycle with the machine&lt;br /&gt;who came with it to clean and re-sharpened the blade .&lt;br /&gt;that&#x27;s it i hope i said everything on this product ,&lt;br /&gt;i bought trought amazon company at $199&lt;br /&gt;bye</li>
    <li> I was so excited to finally trade up my 7 year old workhorse the Braun 7505 to the latest Braun 7-790CC. But the 7-790CC is a complete joke! I end up looking like a homeless guy on crack every time I use it. Or at least feeling like one. My hair is very coarse, and the skin is extremely sensitive so if I go over the same area too many times, my skin breaks up. With my old Braun, I only needed to go over the same area twice - up and down, and that was it. With this one, I doesn&#x27;t matter how many times I move it up and down, it will still leave spots of hair so I end up having to manually shave myself. I think it&#x27;s due to the top middle section that is not getting close enough to the skin, instead it creates a space from the actual blades. And compared to my older one where the middle section sits lower than the outer sections.    The trimmer works mainly to trim my sideburns but if I want to trim the area around from the Adams apple to the chin, it&#x27;s hurts, and irritate the skin...just like one of those cheap $19 trimmers. Not sure why they made the trimmer blade much smaller than my older one. It&#x27;s a breeze to trim the hair with the older Braun.     Battery time compared to my older Braun is actually shorter!!! And my older Braun has a 7 year old battery.     I bought it mainly because I trusted the brand, and read all of the reviews but I&#x27;m suspecting that these reviews are either made by people hired by Braun&#x27;s marketing department, so called fake buyers. Or they are written by people with pretty much no facial hair (Leonardo Di Caprio, Johnny Depp types), and not for people like myself and Sean Connery, Pierce Brosnan, and Santa Clause when he is not working.    I promise you that Braun will soon improve the 7-790 shaver since the only good thing with it is the design.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using razors for years now but my skin had started to get sensitive along my neck so I decided I&#x27;d give an electric razor a go again.  I felt there wasn&#x27;t any point in cutting corners, if it&#x27;s something good it&#x27;s something you&#x27;ll be using every day for years - get the best.  That&#x27;s what I thought I was getting for one of the highest rated electric razors on Amazon, one of the most expensive too.    What I&#x27;m left with is a razor that looks pretty but just does a terrible job.  It can&#x27;t seem to cut the hair on my neck, especially around my adam&#x27;s apple but it had no problem cutting my face twice during my three weeks of use.  And I&#x27;ve tried moving it every which way and pulling on the skin and everything else.  End result is that moving it at a 90 degree angle against the skin with the skin pulled tight and moving against the grain, exactly like the manual says, the hair just stays there.    So I&#x27;m left to either have hairs still on my neck or pull out my old razor to finish the job.  What&#x27;s the point?  To make matters worse it seems to leave my neck feeling worse than a regular blade.    Pros:  - It looks pretty  - Trimmer works pretty darn good    Cons:  - Doesn&#x27;t seem to cut hair well  - Cuts my face  - Irritates the heck out of my neck    All in all this is a terrible product and when you couple it with the price of $200 it&#x27;s just a darn shame.  Here&#x27;s to hoping I can get my money back somehow.    EDIT: As a side note, bravo to Amazon for refunding me the money on this purchase.  At least, in the end, I didn&#x27;t have to pay for this horrible machine.</li>
    <li> Still a little pricey but well worth the money! It&#x27;s also a big improvement over it&#x27;s original design. Very Happy with it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver in early January and waited to get a good feel for the product before reviewing.  I&#x27;ve almost always used Norelco shavers with a couple of exceptions and have not been happy with most electrics.  I do prefer a standard non-elecrtic razor, but early morning rushes sometimes call for the time-saving of an electric razor.  This is by far the best electric that I&#x27;ve owned.  Performance is my standard, not ergonomics or style or ease of cleaning.  A close shave is what is most important (to me) and the Braun delivers better than I&#x27;ve ever experienced from an electric AND has great style, ease of cleaning etc..  I seriously can&#x27;t find a &#x27;con&#x27; in this product.  Some may say price but if this is what it cost to get results, I say fair enough.  I haven&#x27;t thrown away my shave cream yet, but...  note:(FEB. $50 off on future purchase)</li>
    <li> It is the best shaver I have ever owned. It gives the closest shave that I have ever had. It gets all the difficult hairs that others miss.</li>
    <li> I get a shave that is as close as using a razor blade.  I would recommend this product to anyone, definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Still misses some hairs on my neck though.  Other than that very cool.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this thing for over 2 years now and I love it. The replacement cartridge for the shaver is a bit pricey but I could never imagine myself going back to razors or other electric shavers that don&#x27;t do as good a job as this.</li>
    <li> My wife bought a pretty nice rotary razor for me a long time ago which we ended up returning. It would leave my face all red and full with rashes. I felt bad that I had to return her gift so kept looking for a razor and thought to give this a try.    I have used this razor for over two months now. This razor is excellent, no rashes, no burning (well a little around neck). Excellent close shave. If you don&#x27;t clean it everyday, it does drop hair out of the razor. I have noticed less or no hair if the razor is clean. The razor holds charge very well and charges fast. The self clean system is very nice but noisy. I don&#x27;t mind the noise, just don&#x27;t turn on when everyone is sleeping.    I have a very pronounced chin and was worried about this razor not doing a good job. No problem at all, it does a very good job. Overall a very positive experience.    Amazon as usual was prompt in delivery and the item was as described. Also best price at the time.</li>
    <li> I bought this $200+ electric shaver after shaving with a blade for 20+ years.  My wife commented that she didn&#x27;t feel it shaved as close, but by evening it was obvious.  I used it for 30 days just to make sure.  It does fine on the cheecks, but the neck is a pain.    After 30 days I went to return it.  Good luck with the 800 number you call.  Also, there is no information on the Braun website to help you return it.  I had to call 4 times to get the address right to ship it back.  Anyway, I am sending mine back.  Is it a good electric razor, maybe? But it is a dissappointment if you are use to shaving with a razor.</li>
    <li> I have had the Braun 790cc shaver for over a month now.  I have always had to use an electric shaver because I would get horrible rashes and bumps on my neck.  The first Braun and some other foil shaver were horrible.  I used Norelco for the longest time.  I had two previous Norelco&#x27;s that last me about 6 years each.  They were OK and did the job.  I decided to try this one with the 30-day return policy from a local retailer.  The shave was smooth, quick, and perfect for my sensitive skin.  It is a bit noisy and the base cleaner is noisy.  Other than that, there are no real negatives.    Pros:  1.  Close shave  2.  Quick shave  3.  Does not iritate my sensitive skin  4.  Feels comfortable and sturdy in my hand    Cons:  1.  Noisy base, but who cares about that.  Hit clean when you leave the bathroom  2.  A little noisy to use, but not that bad  3.  Causes some ingrown whiskers  4.  Expensive, but worth it.</li>
    <li> This Braun shaver is by far the best electric shaver I have every used. Over the years I have tried most of the shaver&#x27;s that are on the market and this one will give you the best shave so do your face a favor and buy this shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my face and head with Braun shavers for over four decades, way before it was fashionable.  There has never been a breakthrough shaver like the Series 7 Pulsonic.  It&#x27;s actually fun to shave every morning, and the comfort is higher by an order of magnitude.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this for over a year and used it while i&#x27;ve had my facial hair in different styles. I.E. goatee, clean cut, beard. It does give a close shave, but the problem is it doesn&#x27;t do such a great job on all parts of the face. It has a lot of problems with my neck area( an issue i&#x27;m sure a lot of guys have with their electrics). After multiple passes i still can&#x27;t get rid of the hard to get neck patches. It also caused me quite a bit of skin irritation on the neck and chin area. I&#x27;ve tried it both wet and dry and it doesn&#x27;t make a difference in irritation or closeness of shave.  I have an old norelco rotary that shaves almost as well as this. Also, it seems to go through the cleaning solution pretty fast. (even using fast clean function) Overall, i can&#x27;t say the price was worth the $289. Don&#x27;t get me wrong it&#x27;s not horrible, but it does have some considerable flaws.</li>
    <li> I have owned Braun shavers before and have been fairly happy.  This one works quite well also.  However, the cleaning base is defective.  After 4 months of use it could no longer recognize the refill cartridge sometimes and other times started cleaning without the razor inserted.  It was unusable.  I cleaned it to no avail.  Here&#x27;s the rub.  When I contacted Proctor &amp; Gamble, the rep for Braun, I was basically told I had to jump through a thousand hoops to get it fixed.  I&#x27;m left with buying another charger and never buying a Braun product again.  See their email to me below.    Thanks for contacting Braun.

    <li> I upgraded to the 790cc over a year ago, and am currently on my third unit. But first the good points. Shaving is a dream, and even with my coarse, heavy stubble I get a nice smooth shave with no irritation and no stray hairs.    On the cleaning side of things, however, this model has been nothing but a problem. I get flawless operation for about 4 - 6 months, and then the cleaning base mysteriously starts leaking whenever it is used. Given the cost of the cleaning cartridges, this is just unacceptable. Yes, it is on a flat, level surface. My latest unit just started leaking last week, which is what prompted this review. Fortunately, my wife works at a major home retailer for bedrooms, bathrooms, and other stuff (hint, hint), so we&#x27;ve been able to exchange it without problems. I suppose I could just keep doing so, but considering the cleaning unit is a major feature (and, presumably, justification for the expense) it&#x27;s frustrating to have such a short life expectancy.    So, although the shaver works great, the cleaning unit is a complete disappointment.</li>
    <li> ***WARNING, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT***    I have had this for 2+ years, and as with what others said the shaver will lose contact with the base due to the contacts on the base being cheap. The metal wears away in just a short few months of use from the vibration of cleaning. Braun needs to redesign those contacts better. I had to pull mine apart and solder the front contacts so that it would charge/clean again. That is POOR design for such an expensive setup.    Also, after your face has adjusted to the shaver, it makes the blade/shaver not cut as close as it used to, even with a brand new replacement blade, it just doesnt cut like it used to. I have to go back with a flat blade/disposable razer to get the rest or else it will leave stubble. That could just be me, however others are reporting the same thing.</li>
    <li> I have replaced with all new and cleaned the shaving head assembly many times over, yet this shaver does not collect the stubble hair in its head like razors are supposed to do.  Instead, the Braun Series 7- 790cc  scatters the stubble all over your shirt.  All my Norelco rotary razors always collected all of my whiskers internally to be put in the trash.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric shaver bar none for a former razor user!  It is the best value I have come across for an electric shaver.  It provides a very close shave without the added hassle of dealing with a razor and shaving gel.  It took me about 2 weeks to get use to the change (the manual states it could take up to a month).  I get a very comfortable shave without a burning sensation like other electric shavers I have used.  Plus, no occasional cuts like I got from my razor.    I have been a life long razor user (&gt;40 years).  For the closest shave with the occasional cut, I used Gillette&#x27;s Fusion razor and shaving gel.  But I have been appalled by the blade cost and the need to clean out my sink drain every 6 months due to shaving gel build-up.  My payout for the Braun Series 7 system versus Gillette&#x27;s Fusion system is about 12-14 months.    I have used cheaper electric shavers (&lt;$100) in the past with poor results.  Invariably, I gave up since they never gave a close shave and resulted in a burning sensation on my face.  I could never get use to the electric shaver and always went back to a razor within a month of use.    A nice benefit of this Braun electric shaver is the cleaning system.  I do not have to deal with the messy cleaning of blade head.  Just stick it in the charging / cleaning console and I have a fresh shaver ready for use the next morning.  To date, I have used the cleaning cartridge for over a month and the console indicator still indicates it is good to go.  So it is lasting longer for me than the manual prediction of about 1 month.    Overall, I highly recommend this Braun electric shaver to razor users.  I spent about a week looking at reviews and recommendations on electric shavers.  This Braun electric shaver was consistently highly recommended by most of the reviews I read.  So I took a chance and am very impressed with the results I have had.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to electrics, but after several days, I am getting a better shave then I ever did with a blade.  There is a bit of a ritual to be learned - not only how to shave, but how to maintain the razor - but it is easily done.</li>
    <li> An otherwise decent shaver marred by poor customer service.  I experienced a similar problem as many others have reported with the shaver&#x27;s paint peeling off from the painted rubber surface on the back of the shaver.  This occurring despite the use of their Clean &amp; Renew cartridges.  One would think that Braun would recognize this as a design flaw and make good on its warranty.  Call to Braun to review the concern.  Customer service mentions to me by phone that the shaver is covered for a 3 year period ... one cannot find any information easily on their warranty on-line.  I send the package to one of their recommended repair centers in their e-mail ... paying the shipping charge and packaging it off to the repair center.  Call a week later from the center asking for funds to continue as the shaver is 3 months out of the now \\&quot;2 year\\&quot; warranty.  Calls to Braun to discuss are essentially a waste of time ... their line is that even 1 day over the 2 year warranty gets them off the hook in terms of coverage.  No one appears to have any recollection of saying 3 years ... pretty amazing.  No avail to speak to a manager within customer service as they&#x27;ll repeat exactly the same line ... any day over 2 years voids the warranty.  So now ... another $9 to ship the defective shaver back to the house.  $14 of shipping back and forth and still a peeling paint shaver.  My recommendation ... put your hard earned dollars towards a Panasonic!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for the past 6 years, and for the most part its been great. You do need to do occasional maintenance to keep it running well, such as replacing the blade once a year and replacing the cleaning fluid every couple of months, but for the most part its just worked. The cleaning stand did stop working once when some fluid got inside of it, and that cost about 80 dollars to replace, but the shaver itself has had no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I&#x27;ve liked:&lt;br /&gt;- It gives a nice shave, not amazing, but pretty good. If my hair is longer than a day or two, I usually have to first trim it down with the flip out trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;- The battery seems to last a long time. I usually keep it in the stand, which means it&#x27;s always charging, but when taking it on trips, it has lasted a week or two shaving every other day with 50% battery or more.&lt;br /&gt;- I love the fact that it has a stand to clean the blade. Having a clean foil and blade helps against breaking out after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I haven&#x27;t liked:&lt;br /&gt;- The indicator of when you should clean it is based on the amount of time shaver has run vs how dirty or full the shaver is. I was hoping when I bought it, it was smart enough to only want to it clean it when it actually needed cleaning, but since it&#x27;s time based, if I am mainly using the shaver to trim a beard, it says it is past due to clean, even though I&#x27;ve used the actual shaver very little. Most of the time I ignore the indicator and clean based on actual usage.&lt;br /&gt;- The power comb to lift and remove long hairs doesn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped. If I have a hair that is slightly longer and laying flat, I need to flip out the trimmer to remove it.&lt;br /&gt;- If you want a really close shave, you have to first use the flip out trimmer if you haven&#x27;t shaved in more than two days. You also must go over the areas several times to remove all traces of hair. Granted this is an electric shaver and not a razor, but I was hoping that if I bought thetop of the line at the time, it would provide a shave much closer to a razor. It still shaves quickly and fairly decent if you use it fast, but to remove all traces of the hair takes several passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the things I haven&#x27;t liked may seem longer, they are minor compared to the things I have liked. Its been a great shaver and is still working 6 years later without problems. I see no reason to buy another shaver until this one actually dies.</li>
    <li> this is my fourth braun shaver and this time they have really outdone themselves.  Much closer shave than usual with the whole sonic thing and much quicker as well.  Expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver!!! It replaced a Braun Activator 8595. The Pulsonic shaver is quieter, smoother and definitely gives a closer shave than the 8595. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because the blades are moving so fast or the vibrating action or both, but the shave is very smooth with no sense of the beard hairs being pulled or disturbed in any way. It definitely cuts faster and closer on the neck, which was always a problem with the 8595. I also seem to have less skin irritation after shaving. The unit is well made and fits nicely in your hand. Also, the shaver head seems to be larger than the old Braun and swivels more to better follow the contours of your face. I know this shaver is a little pricey, but I think it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> Ok here we go for my first and probably only review on Amazon. I am 50 years old and have tried pretty much every electric shaver known to mankind. Each time giving up due to  the pinching,non close shave and pain in the butt cleaning. In the end, I was going back to razor blades and the frequent cuts. I went to Braun&#x27;s website and read about this shaver and came to Amazon to see the reviews here. I decided after reading the reviews to splurge on another electric shaver.  What a find! This in my humble opinion is the greatest invention EVER! It&#x27;s the first electric razor I&#x27;ve used which doesn&#x27;t get hot after a couple minutes of use.Hot razor means sweaty face which trips up razor and adds to pinching. Braun recommends you shave before you shower or wash your face, while you still have a little protective barrier of oil on your skin. A big no-no with regular shaving, this worked well with the Pulsonic. They also recommend you shave against the grain. Again, not recommended for regular shaving. For electric shaving, works great.    I must say I Absolutely LOVE shaving now.(I would let my beard grow for days because I HATED shaving with razors and cutting myself). The Pulsonic is the closest shave ever by an electric razor(IMHO shaves as close as a razor once you master it) and more importantly it does not pinch or burn at all. Even better is the self cleaning which make life easier.  My wife laughs every morning as she now sees me shaving daily with this god send! if you are reading bad reviews on this product it must be I just don&#x27;t get it.  Bottom line:  BUY THIS NOW! I just ordered another one for my son!  I am telling all who read this if you hate shaving GET THIS PRODUCT you will love it.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and it usually lays flat on my face. Up till now I have never found an electric that really did the job. Almost every electric I&#x27;ve used till now has left tons of stubble and I end up doing a quick dry shave with a razor to clean up missed areas. After who knows how many electric purchases I finally gave up and went back to a razor.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using only a razor (Mach 3) for about 3-4 years now.&lt;br /&gt;Problem with the razors is that I&#x27;m usually in a hurry, nature of my job, and I dont have time to wash, lather, shave, rinse, dry and aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I just need to clean up real quick, so I gave this one a try after reading some reviews and seeing that it had the vibration thing going on I figured I give one last go.&lt;br /&gt;Well, it works. It works great as a matter of fact.&lt;br /&gt;I have a couple trouble areas on my neck where my hair grows kinda sideways and flat but with a bit of persistence and stretching my skin tight I can even get those areas.&lt;br /&gt;And the kicker was that it cleaned my face on the first try. I&#x27;ve been told that I just needed to stick with my electrics and my face would adapt... Bull. I didnt have to wait for any adapting or [...] like that, this thing just shaved my face.&lt;br /&gt;It takes down my cheeks and chin with out any fuss at all and gets it as close to a razor as Ive ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;You can wash the whole thing off in water which makes me happy since I bring it to work with me and cant always have the base around. The travel case has a nifty little holder for your brush as well.&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is a really nice and well thought out shaver.&lt;br /&gt;my only gripe (and it&#x27;s a small one) is the trimmer placement, it&#x27;s a bit akward for me but it&#x27;s not terrible.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is a bit loud since it vibrates in the base so I wouldn&#x27;t clean it on the base if someone was sleeping in the next room.&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of cleaning, cleaning it on the base is a breeze, you push a button and walk away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can choke down the cost, it&#x27;s a really nice razor.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely happy with mine.nitely happy with mine.</li>
    <li> Here is a breakdown of my evaluation of the Braun Pulsonic System 9595CC with LCD Screen:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Pros **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; Construction&lt;br /&gt;The constuction of this shaver is superb. The body of the shaver is made from plastic but it has a very refined metallic look. The LCD screen seems to be made of glass and looks to be fairly scratch resistant. The shaver itself is made in Germany and has the look and feel of quality construction. The shaver is fairly weighty (but not too heavy) which adds to the overall impression of a solid build.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; Function/Performance&lt;br /&gt;The shave is just about as close as that from a shaving blade. Maybe there is something to this \\&quot;Pulsonic\\&quot; technology after all (10,000 Micro-Vibrations per minute) which is supposed to help lift hair to provide a closer cut. I was unable to see or feel any stuble after a shave. The shaved area actually feels silky smooth! Thanks to the new and improved screen foil and cutterblock for the Pulsonic 9595CC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pulsonic has a flexing/pivoting head to help the shaver conform to the contour of your face. I personally don&#x27;t really care very much for it as I&#x27;m accustomed to flexing my wrist to angle the shaver to my face. The pivoting head can also be locked in place to tackle the hard to reach area under the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pop-up trimmer is very functional and does as good a job as a dedicated trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; Features&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning Convenience: The Clean &amp; Renew system automatically cleans, lubricates, and dries the saver at the touch of a button. It also has a 25-second quick cleaning cycle for when you have to use your shaver in a hurry (This feature is only available on the Braun Pulsonic System 9595CC with LCD Screen, not on the lesser equipped Braun Pulsonic System 9585CC with LED Lights). After each cleaning, the shaver smells clean and lemony.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver can be washed under tap water but with this method of cleaning, the manual states that the shaver head needs to be lubed with a few drops of lubricant every week or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver sports an LCD screen which has a \\&quot;hygiene\\&quot; and a \\&quot;battery\\&quot; indicator each of which has six graduations/levels arranged in a semi-circular fashion and occupies half of the screen. The hygiene indicator shows when the shaver needs to be cleaned. The battery indicator, of course, indicates how much power is left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No time to wait around for the shaver to recharge? No problem. The power cord can be hooked up directly to the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; Warranty&lt;br /&gt;The shaver has a 2-year warranty (excludes the Cutter and Foil part - you&#x27;re advised to replace this every 18 months).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; Ergonomics&lt;br /&gt;The back and sides of the shaver are rubberized to help you to maintain a firm and comfortable grip while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; Aesthetics&lt;br /&gt;The Braun Pulsonic System 9595CC exudes elegance, class and sophistication with its sleek lines and its beautifully crafted elements that convey a work of intricate and robust engineering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Cons **&lt;br /&gt;I have only one. Here it is for completeness sake:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; Price&lt;br /&gt;The real gripe I have about this shaver is not so much its price because it&#x27;s a one-time expense but the price of the Clean &amp; Renew cartridges. Talk about \\&quot;giving away razors to sell razor blades\\&quot; except in this case the razor is, patently, not free. Braun advises that the cartridge be replaced after 30 cleaning cycles or 6-8 weeks WCF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Additional Points **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; Economic Considerations&lt;br /&gt;Some economically-conscious people have suggested using isopropyl alcohol mixed with a lubricant to refill the cartridge. The factory cleaning fluid actually contains a highly volatile alcohol and a lubricant component, which is apparent after each cleaning because the residual lubricant can be felt if you run your finger through the sides of the shaver head. They further suggest removing the cartridge and capping it after each cleaning to prevent the loss of the highly volatile fluid. That&#x27;s too much of a hassle and I don&#x27;t see it as a necessity because once the cartridge is in place, the openings of the cartridge form a watertight seal with the cleaning component and the loss of the solution through evaporation is very minimal. At least one individual suggested changing the cartridge every 6-months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Conclusion **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun Pulsonic System 9595CC with LCD is pricey but it is worth every penny. Don&#x27;t let the price of the Clean &amp; Renew cartridges deter you from getting this little gem because you can always forego the automated cleaning option and simply use running tap water. I personally have no regrets about getting this shaver and I highly recommend it. Go on, get it and see for yourself how the Braun Pulsonic System 9595CC with LCD lives up to its hype.enings of the cartridge form a watertight seal with the cleaning component and the loss of the solution through evaporation is very minimal.

    <li> Sturdy feeling shaver. Great shaving result without any rash or irritation. The shaver is quiet big, which makes the handling comfortable, but it&#x27;s a little big to travel with I guess. The basestation looks a bit cheap in comparison with the premium looks of the shaver.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd electronic shaver I purchase from Braun. The Pulsonic 9595CC replaced my Braun 360 complete (LCD model). I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for over 1 month now. Overall it is a substantial improvement from the 360 model. Here are the things I noticed:&lt;br /&gt;1) The handle is much easier to grip; which feels much solid when shaving&lt;br /&gt;2) The new \\&quot;pulse\\&quot; technology definitely helps get a closer shave without irritating my skin (the 360 always left my face feeling hot after shaving; this new model definitely improved on this area&lt;br /&gt;3) The dual shaving mechanisms (two rows) now pivot indepedently of each other; and the head also pivots which is a big improvement. Although the neck are still takes me several passes to get a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;4) I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the new design or what... but the cleaning solution seems to last longer than in the previous model. I run the echo-cleaning cycle every day and it still shows full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it! The LCD is very basic which displays two pieces of information (the charge level and the foil cleaning level). I hope the unit lasts me several years; but if it ever broke down; I would definitely purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alex</li>
    <li> This shaver represents a major step forward for electric shavers and for Braun.  The shave is close and comfortable  -- even on the neck area, where foil shavers don&#x27;t excel.  The Pulsonic shaves much better than the Braun Activator.  It just mows through even a heavy beard. The cleaning base works flawlessly.  The shaver also feels wonderful in the hand. This shaver is the state of the art in 2007 for electric shaving.</li>
    <li> great shaver; great shave ... but the shaver stopped communicating with the base unit in less than 30 days of use and also would not recharge.</li>
    <li> I think Braun is once again standing tall. They really look for new ways to improve their shavers. It is a better shaver than the older series.  The only thing I am not too happy with is the trimmer that pops out. I think that is due to the new style and narrower body. I also like how it fits in my hand as I use it. It is also lighter than the older units.</li>
    <li> I have been using my Pulsonic for almost 2 months and I have yet to get a close shave with this razor. I bought this razor because of the new handy shape and cleaning system, but this is just not enough for over $200 dollars. It ;s not close after you shave and even worse an hour or two later. The Braun 360 did a better job but was too hard to hold and manuver. I have been a Braun user that has switched to Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;I just purchased a new Norelco Arcitec 1090 to replace it and had to eat the Braun razor because Braun only offers a 30 day money back guarantee. Norelco offers 60 days. My first shave with the Norelco was closer than any shave I got with the Pulsonic. If you buy the Pulsonic make a quick decision on whether you like paying for an inferior shave. The Norelco was easy to clean with warm tap water and required no addional expense.&lt;br /&gt;In the contest Between the Pulsonic and the Arcitec, I give 5 stars to the Norelco Arcitec.</li>
    <li> He loves it and his face is as soft and smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind!  Definitely worth the price.  But, I&#x27;d like to see how it does shaving legs - alas, he said no.  If you don&#x27;t shave often because you&#x27;re using a razor, switch to this.  Whoever touches your face will appreciate it!</li>
    <li> I have a very heavy and fast growing beard while also having a very sensitive neck and under-lip area, so I am always on a quest for a razor that can somehow cut down my crazy facial hair and not leave me with horrible razor burn.    My first razor was a norelco rotary which is actually quite good at cutting very long hairs but not at getting a close shave, particularly around the chin and neck.    The second was one of the first generation Braun synchro shavers with the cleaning system.  I found that foil shavers, at least on my face, did a much better job getting in close than the rotary shavers.  However this razor was not as good at cutting longer hairs or my neck area.    I have also used a Mach 3 and the Fusion wet razors.  These give the closest shave but leave me with razor burn the next day that is just brutal to re-shave.  That and when you nick yourself with the fusion you end up with 5 little cuts all bleeding, not so much fun.  Also the cost of the cartridges and shaving creams add up very quickly when I am lucky to get a week out of a single blade cartridge.    Finally, we come to the Pulsonic.  This is an electric shaver that actually leaves my face and neck smooth in every area, yet does not leave me with horrible razor burn.  The head glides over my face easily and does not pull or tug or get horribly warm.  For those areas where the head moves too easily, the lock switch will fix the head into position allowing for precision control.  There is of course a pop-up trimmer for getting long hairs down to size.    The cleaning base on this model is MUCH improved over the original synchro, which had an arm that had to be pushed into the back of the razor (this eventually failed, making the base useless).  Instead this one just has two metal contacts that the razor rests against for charging.  No moving parts.  Cleaning is quick and efficient due to the more intelligent cleaning system that will do light cleanings when the razor has not been used as much.Also, this base uses gentle heating to dry the razor instead of a noisy fan like the old models.    The plastic carrying case is very nice as it will keep the razor safe from crushing while in your luggage and it holds the brush for cleaning while traveling (the head is also washable).  While some complain that it does not hold the charger, this is a moot point to me as the charger just goes in with other electronic chargers or in my toiletry bag.    All in all, I am extremely impressed with this razor.  It seems to fix the design flaws with the original synchro models as well as greatly improving shaving performance.  While the price is steep, finally getting a close shave while not suffering from razor burn makes it worth every penny.  It looks like my quest for a razor that can give me near wet razor closeness without the irritation is finally finished.</li>
    <li> I have shaved my entire adult life using shaving cream and a razor.  I was always happy with how close of a shave I got, but a razor sometmes leaves my skin irritated.  I would shave one day, and not the next in order to give my face some healing time.  When I saw the commercial for this product, I became really excited at the prospect of being able to shave every day while getting great results with every shave.        BOY WAS I DISSAPOINTED!  This razor not only irritated my face WORSE than with a manual razor, it was the worst shave I ever had in my life.  I follwed the instructions, and waited 2 weeks to allow my face to acclimate to the shave.  It never happened.  Thank goodness they have a 30 day money-back guarantee.      If you think $250 is going to buy you a great shave with less irritation, think again.</li>
    <li> Shaving is OK when it works but not as close as my previous Braun. When on the road, not using the cleaning system, the razor gets hot and auto shut-off after half shaving. I contacted Braun customer service (e-mail and phone) and got no support at all except the \\&quot;we are sorry you don&#x27;t enjoy ...\\&quot; There is a real technical problem and Braun refuses to even acknowledge it.Too late to return. I wasted $250 and Braun does not care at all. After 20 years of using Braun, I will switch to another brand.</li>
    <li> After all the electric shavers he has used over the years, this one was by far the best!!!!</li>
    <li> As advertised, it is the best electric shave I have ever had.  It provides a closer shave and does a better job on my neck.  It also doesn&#x27;t cause irritation.  However, it still leaves a few stubborn areas untouched on my neck.  This shaver didn&#x27;t give me the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; shave, but it was a nice upgrade from my 3-head rotary Norelco.</li>
    <li> I bought this Braun Pulsonic Razor for my husband and after two weeks I asked him his opinion.    He is a previous Braun 7000 Series user and fan.  He said that the Pulsonic offers a very close shave. As he keeps his head bald, he also uses it for in between razor shaves for his head. Again, it provides a close shave and seldom misses hairs.    Downside: Trimmer is in an awkward spot (middle of the body of the Pulsonic) and he does not like it versus the older 7000 Series.</li>
    <li> I used to have one of those Norelco&#x27;s with the shave \\&quot;goo\\&quot;. Sometimes it would give a great shave but mostly it left my neck looking like I shaved with a putty knife. I tried using it before a shower, in the shower, after a shower, nothing proved consistent. Eventually one of the recharge prongs broke and out the razor went.    I&#x27;ve used Mach 3&#x27;s for a few years and they are great razors but after 3 or 4 days I get razor burn on my neck where it cuts and hairs that lay along my skin where it doesn&#x27;t. I thought about getting another electric for awhile and I saw the reviews on here and finally decided that many positive reviews couldn&#x27;t be wrong and I got myself a Christmas present.    I know it&#x27;s supposed to take 2-4 weeks to get used to an electric razor. But my 1st shave was almost as good as a Mach 3 and minimal razor burn on my neck. My shave&#x27;s gotten slightly better every day I&#x27;ve used the pulsonic and my razor burn is almost gone. This is definitely a great, intelligently designed razor and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.     Some points to mention:  +Some people have said that the razor is loud and it vibrates. The Pulsonic name should tip you off that maybe the razor vibrates, and it vibrates quickly to... Well, I don&#x27;t quite know why, but it shaves pretty well. Yes, the razor is loud but just start the cleaning cycle as you leave for work and you&#x27;ll never hear it...  +The razor itself feels heavy for it&#x27;s size, which probably speaks for the quality of it&#x27;s construction. However the base is just white I/M plastic but it works.  +The razor will give you a little message when it thinks you should buy a new head cartridge (the manual says they last about 18 months). This is a nice feature to remind you that probably need a new head cartridge and Braun could probably use your money (j/k).    The only real gripe I have is $$$ (initial and recurring). Mach 3&#x27;s are cheaper but I prefer to eat hamburger, not feel like it and you get what you pay for.    If you&#x27;re thinking about buying this, I definitely recommend it both as a good shaver and as a cool, geeky gadget. Make sure you follow instructions and DON\\&quot;T shave right after a shower. This makes your skin &amp; hairs swell and rinses the natural oils off your skin. This makes shaving your face like trying to peel fibers off a carpet! Also a little \\&quot;&#x27;Lectric Shave\\&quot; lotion doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> After purchasing the shaver I expected a new quality close shave that also makes shaving easier when it comes to those stubbern little hair that just refuse to yield.  The unit is very large (had to fit into my case), does not have a blade protection cover other then the one covering the entire unit making transportation even bulkier. The shave took some time to get used to, but I feel it is no better then the one of units half this price. The power cable is a non standard cable, which means you cannot rely on your friends if you are on a longer trip. Time will tell how the cleaning process will maintain the unit.</li>
    <li> my husband wanted an electric razor for christmas, and after doing some research I ordered him this one.  he loves it, and it really works great.  i love that it cleans itself as well - there is a lot less mess in the sink than from his previous electric razor!  happy customer all around!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several shavers over my lifetime.  I would rate this one among the best I had.  The thing that amazes me most is how quickly it works.  It shaves as quickly as a rotary razor while keeping the closeness of a foil shaver.  I also like the fact that it&#x27;s not too loud like many foil shavers.  I have a Panasonic wet/dry foil shaver as well.  The Braun shaves as closely as it, but you get the job done in about 20% of the time.  Don&#x27;t judge it by the first shave it gives you as it takes time to break-in.  It took about two weeks before it shaved as close as the Panasonic.</li>
    <li> Over the past ten years I have owned two top of the line Braun shavers and now own the Series 7-790. I was expecting marginal improvements but I was very pleasantly surprised.    Pro: The shave is extremely close, as about as close a shave as a hand-held razor but without any worries about cutting my skin nor any of the mess or clean-up. The noise level of the 7-790 is much quieter than previous models.  The ergonomics of the shaver provides a comfortable fit in the hand, much more so than my previous bulkier Braun models. The cleaning cycle is much quieter, quite noticeably quieter in fact.  Finally, for the first time with a Braum I can shave very comfortably without washing or putting pre-shave on my beard.  The 7-790 instructions were quite emphatic that the shave should be done before washing the face and they are right.  I was skeptical but no longer.    Con: The travel case is a soft, transparent plastic case that seems less sturdy than the earlier Braun model plastic travel cases I have owned but this complaint is a very minor issue.    I am very pleased with the 7-790, a shaver that went beyond my expectations of an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Are you tired of buying a different kind of razor each time you need a replacement -- just hoping that you&#x27;ll finally find one that works the way you need it to work?  Then look no farther.  This is the razor that all of us have been waiting for.       * It connects with the whiskers growing out of every crevice of your face, chin, and neck.     * It&#x27;s self cleaning cycle just makes sense and gives it a nice, clean scent too.     * It doesn&#x27;t get too hot while using it.     * It feels good in your hand, is easy to grip at different angles, and doesn&#x27;t get slippery if it gets a bit wet.    I know that the price of this razor makes is a purchase that has to be thought out.  But when adding up how much I usually spend on lousy manual razors, shave cream, and replacement blades/cartridges, I&#x27;ll pay for this electric razor in a couple of years ... and people are always writing here and elsewhere about how long the higher end Braun products last.  So that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m counting on.    The last time I tried an electric razor (about 20 years ago now), my face broke out and got all bumpy.  Bummer.  But after using this razor for a week, I&#x27;m sold.  Thanks Braun.  I know have a smile on my face before having my morning coffee.    Gregg</li>
    <li> The new braun pulsonic shaver is a marvelous product and has more than lived up to my expectations.  the many small irritations from previous models have all been eliminated.  My complaint is that the day after I bought it, I received a $50.00 coupn in the mail</li>
    <li> Over the years I have owned and used many, many brands of electric shavers, and this one tops them all. I am more than pleased and delighted with this expensive purchase from Amazon. It is simply the best out there and gives me the best electric shave I have ever had.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item at June and it claims I will receive a $50 gift card later. 3 months pasts and I got nothing,</li>
    <li> since purchasing this shaver i actually look forward to shavinmg every day; so smooth and effective; highly recommended</li>
    <li> I have been an Amazon customer for over 10 years and seldom write reviews.  I think I&#x27;ve written two.  I have to comment on this razor.  My beard is difficult to shave without a blade razor due to the graininess of my neck.  I was shaving with a Norelco for many years.  It would almost always leave hair on my neck that I had to shave off with a razor blade to get a good shave.   I&#x27;ve gone back and forth from blade to Norelco trying but failing to get a good electric shave.  After reading many reviews on Amazon and other places I decided to buy the Braun Series 7-790cc Pulsonic Shaver.    When it arrived I thought I must have received the wrong thing.  The package was far larger than I would have expected leading me to feel that $10 of my purchase was probably for packaging alone.  If you are into \\&quot;Green\\&quot; you wouldn&#x27;t like it.    Once I got the razor out and set up the cleaning mechanism I was ready to go.  The shave was incredible for an electric razor.  The swivel head made shaving all parts of my face easy.  Those tough grainy spots on my neck were easily shaved off.  I did learn I need to shave against the grain to get the best shave.  The razor is large and noisy, but I found it easier to handle than my Norelco.  The trimmer works nicely as well.    The cleaning system is quite interesting.  You insert a liquid cleaning cartridge in the bottom of the cleaning/charging station.  When you are done shaving you set the razor in the cleaning/charging station and press clean.  You can hear liquid being dispensed then it runs the razor for a while.  I think it cleans for 20 to 30 minutes - not quite sure.  Most of the time it is just sitting there.  It adjusts depending on the amount of dirt in the razor.  They say to clean it daily, but I have gone up to 4 days without cleaning it as a result of taking it on a business trip (comes with a carrying case).  You also have the option of just cleaning it manually but it is not as fun (I am a gadget geek).  They say the cleaning cartridges will last a month, but I&#x27;ve been able to get mine to last 7 or 8 weeks.    I would recommend buying this razor if you want to get a high quality electric shave.  I would purchase this razor again.</li>
    <li> This is one of my first Amazon reviews.  I love Amazon and spend a ton of money and get packages every day.  However, this purchase was a BIG disappointment.     I found this thing to either really do a terrible job or my face is different then everyone else&#x27;s.  My shave wasn&#x27;t nearly as close after 3+ weeks of use and I spent much more time trying (but never succeeding) in getting a close neck shave.  I cleaned daily and still ended up with pimples.  Best of all, when they mean there are shipping restrictions for this product, it really means you can&#x27;t send it back to Amazon.      IF you are going to try this product, try it from a local retailer that will let you return the product when you don&#x27;t like it.  Maybe my wife can use it on her legs because I went back to my mach4 razor.</li>
    <li> I replaced an old Braun 7505 with the 9595 and waited two weeks to comment, so here goes.  I have never had it so good with a shaver.  I tried every way I know how to use it and the best shave for me in the morning is to apply \\&quot;Lectric Shave\\&quot; a few minutes prior.  This is the closest electric shave I&#x27;ve ever had but I&#x27;ll have to admit, if you want to go to the trouble to lather up and use a regular razor, you&#x27;ll get a closer shave still.    One thing I don&#x27;t understand is why my 5 o&#x27;clock shadow is not as noticeable as it was with all other shavers I&#x27;ve used.  It doesn&#x27;t really get rough until the next morning.  I feel guilty as I watch it go through the cycle of cleaning itself.  I only clean mine every other shave and that should extend the life of the fluid.  I shied away from buying one initially due to the price but I finally rationalized it was only the equivilent of 4 tanks of gasoline.  Didn&#x27;t get a brush as mentioned by other reviewers.  I guess it was an oversight or they&#x27;ve discontinued the practice.    I like this shaver!    P.S. It took no \\&quot;getting used to.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I have always used electric shavers.  I&#x27;ve owned Braun shavers for many years.  I have never had any success with a blade razor, rips my face up, so I can&#x27;t compare the closeness to a blade.  But in my opinion, Braun beats the other electrics for a close shave.  I especially like the ease of cleaning with the self clean system.  The shave is as close or closer than my other Braun shavers and it is smooth and quiet.  Some reviews said it seemed plastic and cheap.  I don&#x27;t agree, it seems to be well built.  I think it is over priced, but I&#x27;m happy overall.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000Q6SU3C Braun Pulsonic System 9595 with LCD Screen]] This razor, with its self-cleaning system, has exceeded my expectations by far for smooth, comfortable and efficient shaving.   The whole process is such a pleasure to use, and upon finishing each shave, I simply slip the razor into its self-cleaning base unit. In no time at all, it is automatically and hygienically cleaned and recharged. The base unit&#x27;s LCD screen shows me when it is thoroughly clean, dry and ready for reuse.</li>
    <li> The shaver runs hot and gives a mediocre shave at best compared to a good blade.  What&#x27;s even worse is Amazon&#x27;s ludicrous return policy:  no return is permitted for this item because it contains flammable liquids (the cleaning solution), which supposedly would be too dangerous to ship back.  If the solution is so dangerous to ship, how and why did they ship it to me in the first place? What a load of bunk!</li>
    <li> This one give much closer shave than the Braun Syncro I have been using the last 5 years. It also causes less irritation to the skin.    But they skimped on the travel kit. The syncro comes with a nice leather bag where you can store the adapter and the unit. This one comes with a plastic box and you cant have the adapter in it. Also I feel the syncro has a better trimmer, this one has a pop out trimmer that is angled in some odd angle is not great to trim ur side-burns and such.</li>
    <li> This is my first shaver. I am very happy so far. It gives a good clean shave and is easy to use. It charges quickly and works on both 110 and 220 which is very important for me. I am bewildered why it costs 200 Dollars in the USA and over 300 Euros in Portugal.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about spending over $100 on a shaver but decided to take the plunge since I had been saving the Amazon gift certificates I receive through their Visa rewards program (I give 5 stars to the rewards program).       In the past I&#x27;ve had to use Norelco rotary style shavers for my neck area and Braun foil style shavers for my face.  I went through countless shavers trying to find the one that would do it all.  I&#x27;m happy enough with the 9595 as a single solution but can tell you it takes a longer time for me to get the right shave.  I find I have to stretch the skin more often than I used to and that I&#x27;ve got to make repeated passes over the same area in different directions (perhaps due to years of rotary shaving?).  The resulting shave is closer than I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric but it takes twice the time.  Had I not used what amounted to free money to purchase this shaver I&#x27;d probably be a little disappointed due to this increase.  I will say that at first I was a little skeptical of the base station cleaner but after a month of use I wouldn&#x27;t go back to cleaning the old way.  The cartridges aren&#x27;t that expensive and it is nice having what feels like a new shaver every time I use it.    10/23/09 - Have replaced blade, foil and use cleaning agent daily.  I&#x27;m not as happy with the shaver now as I had been before.  While I can shave with it I can&#x27;t get a close shave unless I spend a lot of time going over the same areas over and over.</li>
    <li> I like having an option to  a regular razor, for when time does not allow to shave. I owned to previous Braun razor&#x27;s and this is the best. I purchased it after reading several positive reviews here on Amazon, as well as other sites. The one thing I kept hearing was the closeness of the shave. I totally agree the Braun Pulsonic gives a really great close shave. I love it and high recommend it.    A happy Braun Pulsonic 9595 Customer</li>
    <li> read the info given on the site..it is a very good -super-shaver for men with delicate skin.</li>
    <li> If you need a gift for a male in your life, this one works so well.</li>
    <li> This was a gift from my wife. I had used a Braun 5314 for many years. The Pulsonic is the best electric shaver I have ever used. It is truly as close as any shave with a blade! With the self cleaning, it is always fresh.</li>
    <li> Normally electric shavers leave my face looking like I fell off a motorcycle onto pavement face first.  Plus, they always leave hairs, full hairs not even cut, in random places.  My hairs are quite tough, and I go through razor blades extremely fast, so I don&#x27;t blame the electric razors, they simply wouldn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I took quite a chance in getting this electric razor.  I wanted to try the new sound pulse system, and the self cleaning really appealed to me as a way to keep the razor fresh and ready to go each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I got the razor and hooked everything up and let it charge.  The next morning I shaved against the grain before I showered (both are recommended by Braun for this razor).  It seemed to do pretty well.  It missed a couple of random hairs no matter how many times I went over them, but not as many as other razors.  I also know that you have to \\&quot;train\\&quot; your face to use an electric razor so I was okay with that.  The problem with other razors was that I could never use them long enough to get to that point, the irritation and damage they did as they pulled the hairs out of my face were too much to handle.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I was very happy with this Braun 9595cc, it didn&#x27;t pull out hairs, it cut them very close (on the upper part of my face closer than my quad blade razors did), and it did not irritate as much as previous razors.  On the lower part of my face (under the jawline and down the neck) it doesn&#x27;t cut quite as close.  I assume this is do to the fact that it&#x27;s not as flat and regular there, as well as the fact that the hairs grow multiple directions there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have used it for almost a month.  I am very happy with the ease of use, and the self cleaning system.  On the upper part of my face it still does very well and cuts very close.  On the lower part it is getting more and more on the first pass.  Also, it is leaving less and less completely missed hairs, and sometimes even gets them eventually with multiple passes.  I really feel that eventually I will not have to take out my blade at all to catch these misses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very pleased with this razor.  I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars due to the fact that I still have to use my blade on my neck on occasion.  I can say that I haven&#x27;t found an electric razor that does better than this one yet.eventually I will not have to take out my blade at all to catch these misses.

    <li> I bought this razor for my husband and he absolutely loves it!  He&#x27;s in the military so a cleanly shaved face is a must.  With a regular razor he would complain of razor burn and stubble growing back too quickly.  Since switching to this razor, I haven&#x27;t heard a peep from him on those subjects!    I can definitely notice a difference as well.  His face is much less red, and his 5 o&#x27;clock shadow has turned into a 9 o&#x27;clock shadow.  And if he does let it grow in over the weekends, it comes in much slower and softer than with a traditional razor.    All around, it&#x27;s a great product and I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my purchase. This razor gives me in a few minutes a very close shave.</li>
    <li> Still not sure what the difference is between the Series 7 and the 9000 series (maybe US/European?), but the shavers look identical.  I&#x27;ve used the 9595 for about a year and it is definitely the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve used a lot (Panasonic, Norelco, Remington).  The one con I would submit is that (on the 9595) the silver paint on the plastic back above the rubber handle just below the head seems to dissolve over time in the cleaning solution (less than a year of daily use).  Really inexcusable by Braun on a shaver this price, but I didn&#x27;t subtract from the score because functionally it does everything advertised; they just need to get engineering to add a metal strip to this vulnerable area and nix the cheap plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum to above after a year of use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Quick shave, new \\&quot;Pulsonic\\&quot; action of head does provide a quicker, cleaner shave.&lt;br /&gt;- Cleaning unit probably the best of a not very good lot to clean and sanitize shaver&lt;br /&gt;- Good ergonomics and easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worse:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Very cheaply made, as others have observed; I would guess more than 80% plastic&lt;br /&gt;- Some features very poorly engineered; case in point, the head \\&quot;Lock\\&quot; button is held on by I would guess a plastic cylinder less than 1 mm thick, and mine recently fell off, as other have reported.  This design could not possibly last much longer than the warranty period without breaking, and it appears to be built with that thought in mind.&lt;br /&gt;- Speaking of warranty, other customers are right - Braun customer service is non-existant; you will be referred to your nearest \\&quot;customer service center\\&quot; to negotiate a repair or replacement on your own.  I live in a major metropolitan area, and mine is located in a small town more than an hour away, and appears to be a Mom &amp; Pop operation not much interested in repairing Braun&#x27;s mistakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would change my rating to no higher than a 3 based on my extended experience, but I am unable to modify the original rating*.  I purchased a Panasonic wet &amp; dry shaver, which is a little more messy but provides a smoother and more comfortable shave, a better built razor and definitely a more customer-friendly company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Changed ratinget &amp; dry shaver, which is a little more messy but provides a smoother and more comfortable shave, a better built razor and definitely a more customer-friendly company.    *Changed rating</li>
    <li> I normally wear a beard, but periodically I need to shave either for a job or for personal preference. I am a blade man, using a Gillette Mach 3 and keeping an old Norelco Triple Header for quick back-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get tired of lathering-up every day that I shave, but have always been dissatisfied with electrics when I use them. I invariably get really bad razor burn and a poor, uneven shave. I&#x27;ve experienced this even with brand new rotary type razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of this ended with my purchase of this razor. Although the instructions say that it takes 3 weeks to get used to the razor, I had the best electric shave of my life with my first shave. I have used this razor several times now, and it is great! I get a shave so close to the blade that I really can&#x27;t tell any difference; indeed for some parts of my face it is even closer than a blade. Razor burn is absolutely ZERO, I can apply aftershave with no burn at all. This is very important to me, as I perspire a lot and don&#x27;t want to be irritated all day. I couldn&#x27;t be more impressed or pleased with the shave I get from this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is that I wish the cleaning system was refillable, rather than having to buy and discard a bunch of plastic gizmos. Not very environmentally friendly. I intend to clean the shaver manually and only use the cleaning system every 3rd shave to prolong the life of the cartrages. Its nice that you get instructions for 2 manual cleaning methods - hot water and brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know, sometimes you get what you pay for. I would never have expected to pay $200+ for an electric razor, but I have to say that I feel like I am getting a $200+ shave every morning. It is worth the money. All I have to do now is keep it away from my wife&#x27;s legs  :(</li>
    <li> I love this product and would not reccomend another one. Mine got stolen out of my car and I had to have another one.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this shaver from amazon since July 2008 after doing my research seeing that it&#x27;ll be a great fit for my facial hair that normally curls in when growing. Well when I first got it I was pretty excited about the razor. It cut pretty decently but it left a razor burn that I didn&#x27;t like to much. I tried other products to help cool down the razor burn and I guess the shaving got better. The shaver itself works great the only downside I have is how expensive the cleaning products are for it and also I sometimes have a hard time finding a replacement head.  Of course the shipping and how I received the product was in great condition from the vendor.</li>
    <li> This is the worst shaver I have ever had. Next time, if I want to spend my money, I will get a Philips b/c I had to shave my face 8 times and even that I don&#x27;t fell smooth in my face.</li>
    <li> Found the product to be everything I hoped for.  It does an excellant job and I am well satisfied.</li>
    <li> Beware of reviews which rate this product after using it for a short period of time.  The razor itself works well, very close shave, on all lengths of hair.  But in time things fall apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The construction is VERY flimsy.  In the first week that I owned it, the lock that  keeps the swivel head in place broke, permanently.  Yes, it was under warranty and I could have exchanged it then, but I needed to travel, and it didn&#x27;t seem \\&quot;that\\&quot; big of a deal.  It&#x27;s been annoying, but it doesn&#x27;t affect the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, a year on, the trimmer, which is meant to pop up when needed, and then snap back into place when you are not using it, is in a permanent \\&quot;up\\&quot; position and will not close.  This means that the blades are vibrating and eating up more battery juice, causing users to charge more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate it when plastic is made to look like metal and doesn&#x27;t perform in even the simplest manner!  I think the entire device will likely begin to disintegrate in a few more months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun should take care with the construction and give it the same attention that they give to the actual cutting edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final analysis: shaves well, but destined to break apart, bit by bit. Not what one expects when paying this much money.  I&#x27;m going back to Panasonic for my next purchase.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable electric razor. I received my razor this past Saturday, used it, and could not believe the shave---especially no burning of the neck. I used it again on Sunday, this time really going over the next area several times to see if I can experience the burning sensation once the water hit the neck area. Still no burning of the neck.     I have been using electric razors for the past 30 years, Braun and Norelco, and I buy a new model every two to three years; and I can honestly say the Braun Series 7- 790cc is definitely the best. I can vouch for all of the positive reviews and also--I usually never spend more than $175 for an electric razor. The reason I did it this time because I used Bill Me Later. Now, I am thinking if I didn&#x27;t have the BillMeLater program, I would have missed out on a FANTASTIC electric razor.</li>
    <li> Very good shave, but still not superb. I have problem areas on my neck and this shaver will get most, but still leaves a few hairs behind. Overall the best shaver I have used, but no breakthrough in technology.</li>
    <li> Amazon.com should be ASHAMED.  I&#x27;m sorry.  I was a huge amazon.com fan until I needed to return this Braun Series 7 Top-of-the-line shaver \\&quot;new and unopened\\&quot; due to receiving an identical one as a gift.  The invoice says \\&quot;Returns are easy\\&quot;.  When I bring up the purchase on the website it says \\&quot;Click here for returns\\&quot;.  BUT you CAN&#x27;T return it.  No matter what.  You trustingly click that purchase button and you&#x27;re STUCK WITH IT!  Certainly, used personal items can&#x27;t be returned for obvious health reasons.  But a new, unopened product this expensive with tamper proof packaging what has never been used that they won&#x27;t even acknowledge is shameful and unacceptable.  No warning on the invoice.  No notice on your confirmation page before you purchase.  Just a big fat expensive suprise!  Anywhere else I checked said they&#x27;d gladly accept the return.  Amazon won&#x27;t.  No reasoning, no explanation.  Just sorry you&#x27;re out of luck.  Thow it out or give it away, but don&#x27;t look at us. Unless you are brave or omniscient and know that you will never ever need to return it to amazon, buy it ANYWHERE ELSE BUT here at Amazon.com.    Sorry Braun for the 1 star.  I wish I could have given even less stars but it&#x27;s not your fault.  Your Braun Series 7 - 790cc Pulsonic Shaver is fantastic and deserves 3.5 - 4 stars (the is no razor that shaves as close as a blade so none are perfect and none deserve 5 stars--plus your alcohol based cleaning system that will run at least $75/year to use is overpriced and a rip off.  Make it cheaper, especially after charging $290 for the razor.  At least printer manufacturers realize they are ripping you off for the ink cartridges and practically give away their printers to rope you into spending money endlessly on their refills.  The shaver works amazingly well compared to many others I&#x27;ve used, it&#x27;s built well so far, and is easy to use.  The cleaner does keep it clean and hygenic.  It deserves 4 stars, minus 1/2 to 1 for the cleaner refill ripoff ($6-7/mosfor $0.50 worth of rubbing alcohol?, which evaporates even if you don&#x27;t use it daily) with it&#x27;s unsitely cleaning unit that has to sit on your countertop forever due to the evaporating rubbing alcohol.  The shaver is terrific though.      Buy one, enjoy it, just DON&#x27;T BUY IT FROM AMAZON no matter what you do because they WILL NOT have anything to do with returning it for ANY reason, whatsoever, no matter what!  The web site actually (literally) tells you to throw it away if you try to return it and when you email amazon.com they tell you to give it to someone else as a gift (verbatim).  So when you&#x27;re about to drop $200-$300 dollars on this razor, spend it elsewhere where there is actual service and respect for you.  Any other store will gladly accept it new and unopened (just as amazon promises but won&#x27;t) if you decide you don&#x27;t want it, don&#x27;t need it, have two, etc. and refund you in full.  Amazon WON&#x27;T.  You are STUCK WITH IT no matter what happens.  It&#x27;s too expensive of an item to take the risk with amazon...unless you have friends who are used to $250 gifts or a deserving trash man.    Caveat Emptor:  BUYER BEWARE!!!!!  Don&#x27;t say I didn&#x27;t warn you.      Update 12/13/08:  After a second email to Amazon.com I received a suprising email back that they were going to fully refund my money for the item and did apologize.  I can&#x27;t tell you how suprised I am or how appreciative but don&#x27;t count on this in the future.  Don&#x27;t expect to be able to return the shaver, but thank you Amazon for making right.  My faith is restored, but future buyers beware and be sure before purchasing.  Thank you amazon.</li>
    <li> I have a Braun 5760 and after three bases going bad(defective lock),  I decided to upgrade even though I was very satisfied with the 5760 shaver itsself.    There is a tremendous difference between the two.  The shaver is very quite. It is smoother, closer and very comfortable.    The base, with its cleaning and automation on it including the shaver is very impressive and useful.  My first thought was this is rather expensive, but after receiving and using it, it is well worth the money,  Top of the line product and no lock to go bad!!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000IWFU3W Braun 790CC Series 7 Men&#x27;s Cordless Shaver]]    I have been using electric shavers for close to 60 years, starting with the Schick, Remington and at least half a dozen Norelco shavers over the years, the last being the Spectra.  My 4 shaves with the Braun Series 7 have been the closest I have ever gotten with an electric shaver and my face has never been as smooth since I  started shaving.  It is fast, easy to use and, at this point of my using it, would recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous electic razor this new one by Braun is a work of art ,it&#x27;s very quiet and works better than any razor I ever had.I recomend this product wholr heartly,you will be very happy.It&#x27;s worth the price because it&#x27;s state of the art and works fast,smooth and quiet.</li>
    <li> It shaves like any other razor, except, it doesn&#x27;t give you a rash, which is a big plus for me. Doesn&#x27;t do that great of a job on my neck or above the lip, have to go over it many times, but it does it without giving me a rash, and my face comes out smooth. I have been using it now for about 2 months without any problems.  It cleans itself very good, and its a nice looking shaver. I just hope the longevity is good.</li>
    <li> I read through many of the reviews on this product and perhaps that set me up to expect something better than most.  What I have found after a few weeks of using the product is that it is just plain average.  Nothing note-worthy at all in the whole Pulsonic concept.  Really, it seems much like every other shaver on the market.  In plain honesty, I think this product should not sell for more than $140.  Furthermore, I think an $80-120 price range electric shaver from almost any of the name brands will provide just as good a shave.</li>
    <li> My wife purchased this shaver for me. I had it two weeks whent the platic tab that immibilizes the shaving head broke off. I returned it to the retailer and they replaced it with a new one. A few days later the same part broke off the new one. I called Braun customer support - what a waste of time!!! I returnnd it to the retailer and they gave me a refund. I bought the Braun series 5 shaver for $100 less and I am thrilled with it. For $200+, I didn&#x27;t expect it to be so poorly made. Don&#x27;t waste your time on the series 7 - it is very expensive and made very poorly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used Braun razors and this one is by far the closest shaving unit yet. It&#x27;s also fast. Braun always had the best looking products, but they lost their way with recent models and this doesn&#x27;s have the timeless ID that&#x27;s been a Braun hallmark.</li>
    <li> I have had it for about 2 months and what a GREAT product...was kind of hesitant with the price, but it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
    <li> I had been using Norelco Razors for over 6 years, and was never fully satisfied with them.  When I waited more than 2 days to shave, it was a painful experience caused by pulling hairs.  My neck would never be clean, even after trying to spend more than five minutes on it.  Also, by the end of the work week, the shave would barely be passable as clean.  I decided to get the Braun 790cc for Christmas.  My morning experience is completely different!  The shaver comes out of the cleaning system (which is less intrusive than I imagined) smelling great.  The shave itself takes under a minute, with all hairs easily being removed.  There is no irritation, whether at the start or end of the week.  And in addition, the shave is always cleaner than with the Norelco!  It&#x27;s an expensive product, but I am completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> I got my unit to replace a Norelco shaver. Due to my job I have to shave 5 or even 6 times a week so few years back I had to get an electric shaver because the blade just messes up my face after two consecutive shaves. Back then it was a choice between the Norelco and Braun and I went with Norelco which now I know was a mistake. This is not even the same league. This by far the cleanest shave I have ever had. Still not as clean as a blade but nothing compares to the blade especially if you shave against the direction of hair. But how many of us can do that two days in a row? I can&#x27;t my face blows up!    The charging unit in my opinion is a gimmick but it is cool. It is there to provide additional income for Braun. You can just put the head under flowing water and wash it like that and then use the unit once in a while or never if you want to. Btw the charging unit broke for me as well hence the 4 stars. However Amazon got me a new one and it is on its way. I also could not return my existing unit but I will definitely not complain about that.    There is also a 10% off coupon somewhere on the net for this shaver.    I definitely recommend this product especially if you can&#x27;t handle the blade.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I was a bit skeptic about buying yet another electric razor... but was happily surprised by the outcome!  Yes indeed, I was almost extatic that this razor was not only as good as rated by others, but exceeded my expectations by a strong degree!  I&#x27;ve been shaving with the top of line models by Panasonic, Norelco, among others and this is by far the closest any have come on my face.    Indeed the Braun \\&quot;Series 7-7900cc Pulsonic\\&quot; was indeed \\&quot;almost\\&quot; as close to a razor cut as I could have expected.  Indeed, if it wasn&#x27;t a true electric, I would have thought it was a hard physical razor, as it shaves \\&quot;almost\\&quot; as close.  I stated \\&quot;almost\\&quot;, because while it&#x27;s shave was as good as I have found in an electric, my blade often does get a bit closer, but only a \\&quot;bit\\&quot; and only if I give the shaving effort extra care.      Simply put, if you&#x27;re looking for an electric, this is the one to buy depending on your beard type and growth!!!  It&#x27;s shave is simply beautiful and gets almost as close as the most recetnly released five blade hard razor (such as the  \\&quot;Gillette Mach 3 Turbo\\&quot;) if you take your time with it.  Now the bladed razor is still a \\&quot;fraction of a bit\\&quot; better, but for the extra effort and money spent, I would strongly suggest you try this out before deciding.    As for keeping it clean, I suggest you take the cleaning fluid out of the base and only put it in weekly for an occasional cleaning and fresh renewal, please re-seal it up with the original removed cleaning fluid cover. other than that, it&#x27;s good to go from there...    The reason I gave it only a four out of five star rating is that while it&#x27;s close to a perfect shave, it&#x27;s not quite perfect and as a rule I&#x27;m a bit tough of a judge anyway.  You decide for yourself, as you might just consider it a five star product for yourself!  I almost did... but there&#x27;s always room for improvement.      Cheers mate!    P.S.  As for the after-shave comfort with this razor, it&#x27;s without any equal on the market, \\&quot;at least to my current knowledge and experience\\&quot;!  Even after shaving and then showering right after, my skin doesn&#x27;t hurt one bit and that&#x27;s a true blessing indeed!  Also, while I do expect it to lose \\&quot;some\\&quot; of its quality in shaving over time and with ongoing repeated use, I suspect that I will enjoy this razor for quite some time to come and look forward to it!  I think that depending on your face and beard type, that you will as well...</li>
    <li> LOVE MY NEW BRAUN SHAVER WORKS GREAT AND DOESNT TEAR YOUR SKIN APART LIKE THE OTHER ELECTRIC RAZORS I HAD</li>
    <li> Just received the new Braun Series 7-7900cc Pulsonic Shaver via Amazon.    The shaver locking mechanism fell apart on the side of the head, just hanging there, keeping me from using the cleaning base.  When I contacted Braun Customer Service per the manual at 1-800-272-8611 I was informed me that their money back guarantee has been rescinded for defective products.  This is in spite of that offer printed in the owner&#x27;s manual that I received.  Their offer now is that, upon receipt of the defective Braun shaver, they will offer a customer credit in eight to ten weeks for future purchase of Braun products, but they are not in a position any more, due to a new policy change, to refund my money.  I am irate that they will not stand behind their guarantee anymore on a product that I just received a day ago.</li>
    <li> The thing does what its was design to do.  It leaves your skin feeling smooth.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like its that I have to have the charger plug in almost every day.  You also have to keep replacing does cleaning cathridges.  In my opinion thats more money your going to have to spend on this product.  I replaced a Norelco shaver that lasted me 9 yrs with only two replacement on the razor heads.  Overall I&#x27;m glad I have it but don&#x27;t like those few things.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Braun series 7 razor.  I have been using it for about a month now. The razor itself works ok but not 3 times as well as my old norellco triple head razor. It does get under the nose hairs a little better as well as some neck hair. I suggest buying the triple head razor and getting a bottle of LECTRIC SHAVE. works well to remove stubble. Hey with the Braun you have to buy replacement cleaning fluid for the self cleaning base. What a ripoff. Also because of the ultrasonic vibration of the razor it is quite loud when in use. It fits well in my hand but so did my old triple head.. If you realy want one I suggest you drop some hints to your friends  or family members to buy it for your birthday.</li>
    <li> For at least the last 8 years I&#x27;ve used a number of high end Panasonics.  I was always pleased but this shaver is an incredible improvement.  It is simply the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;m surprised by how much I like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to write a lot but just want to say that this shaves me as close as a blade as long as I take my time and don&#x27;t blow through a 1-2 minute shave.  I&#x27;ve had it for 2 weeks, and am still working on perfecting shaving my neck quicker.  Face is super smoothe with ease. Can get there with the neck too, but sometimes seem to miss a spot or two.    Not sure what others do with cleaning, but I&#x27;ve used the full cleaner once a week, and did a fast clean every other day, while not doing anything on the day that I don&#x27;t do a quick clean or full clean.  Not sure what others do, but don&#x27;t have the time for a full clean each day and even a fast clean seems a little like overkill.   Haven&#x27;t washed under the faucet and manually cleaned yet.    Was debating holding out for the 790cc2 with 3 speeds like canada has (see braun website).  that one has a slightly different foil too that i understand will work on this one.  No clue when that will be out here though and went with this instead.  Very happy with it.  Blows my Norelco Speed XL out of the water.</li>
    <li> I have owned several different razors and this one by far gives me the closest shave I have ever had. I love the self cleaning feature that comes with this razor. If you purchase this product, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I tried this shaver several times and I looked like I hadn&#x27;t shaved at all.  If you have coarse dark hair this shaver is not for you.</li>
    <li> This shaver really gives a close shave. The Pulsonic&#x27;s viberating head really works to cut the small hairs under the chin that other shaver just push down flat and leave. It is expensive but after using it I would buy it again.    Thanks Braun,    Douglas</li>
    <li> Great razor, when working.  Died after 11 months, never had an issue with Braun b4.  Hopefully the repair shop will resolve.  Braun customer service would not replace unit.  Guess the sign of times.</li>
    <li> I had this in my cart here at good old Amazon and than I read M. J. McConnell&#x27;s review. His review is listed under the 4 star reviews and he states that this is old stock that Braun/Proctor and Gamble is trying to get rid of. Well I believe him. When it comes to capitalism and the lies they spread I rather keep looking for an honest company that sells a good electric razor. So Braun/Proctor and Gamble I was ready to dish up close to $300.00+ (Braun Series 7- 790cc shaver, Braun Clean &amp; Renew Refills, Braun Replacement Pulsonic 9000 Series Foil - extra stuff in case of a nuclear holocaust) but decided not to when I read the other reviews. I have an old Braun 5110 that shaves just fine. That is the reason for 2 stars. Companies today just don&#x27;t make stuff like they use too. Have you checked out the size of Chips Ahoy cookies - I mean they are getting to be the size of a quarter.</li>
    <li> I have owned many Braun shavers over the years and really like this one.  Produces very nice close shaves without any skin irritation.</li>
    <li> For many years I have used a blade to shave and as a result, I didn&#x27;t shave every day.  Many times I would only shave once a week, for church, since it was so hard on my face.  Nearing my 50th birthday, however, I woke up one morning and decided I wanted to shave daily and always be clean shaven.  Yikes... My face stayed raw and red.  I decided I needed to do something different.  My wife convinced me to try an electric.  I wanted the Braun but balked at the price... as usual, she won the argument.    And I&#x27;m glad she did!  The 7-790cc is an amazing product.  After a short, easy break-in period, my face is now used to me shaving every day without any redness or other problems.  The closeness rivals a blade, something I didn&#x27;t expect.  I love the cleaning system as it keeps the shaver fresh and clean after each use.  I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough.  I&#x27;m a very satisfied customer!</li>
    <li> This is my second Braun shaver.  It works like it should and shaves about the same as my older one.  I couldn&#x27;t see how they could have made it shave any better, since the last one I had would make my face smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind!  My old one eventually started to tire out and I thought it would be a good time to replace it.  I have owned the Norelco shavers and they just didn&#x27;t do as well as these Braun shavers do for my face.  But, I have friends who like the Norelco shavers better?  I guess it just depends on your face shape and skin type?  I do know that Braun works for me!  It&#x27;s every bit as good as my last one and maybe a tad bit better(Ergonomically and Electrically speaking).  The shaving experience is about the same and that&#x27;s all I was wanting!</li>
    <li> Works fairly well,   Have only used for three weeks, and the instructions say it takes a little longer for your face to get use to using this shaver.  The cleaning feature works great and everything else works great, just not the close shave I am use to with my manual razor.</li>
    <li> There are over 800 reviews at the time of writing -I&#x27;ll attempt succinctness.    Background:  This is my first Braun.  I&#x27;ve owned several electric shavers (a couple Norelcos, a few Remingtons). I have a thick beard (Gillette Fusion razor heads last ~3 shaves on my face).    Results:  Against Norelco and Remington, the 790cc provides a quieter shave than any foil I&#x27;ve heard, but louder than any rotary I&#x27;ve heard -as can be expected. It brings a more smooth (cleaner and less irritation) and fast shave (even on my 2-day growth, out-of-box test). To see it in action, search \\&quot;Braun Pulsonic Review\\&quot; on youtube there are at least 2 reviews with close-up demonstrations of the actual shave (though one is Russian). My results, however, were better than both of these.    Considerations:  The unit doesn&#x27;t include a protective foil cover, consumers are expected to either store the unit the stand or the plastic coffin it comes with.  For those, like me, who are hesitant toward the price: It is an excellent shave that will pay for itself in ~1 year, compared to manual shaving. (1 pack of razors every month ~$264 annual &amp; 1 Braun cleaning contridge every month ~$50-$60 annual) -it was worth it to me.</li>
    <li> 10 months into owning this shaver it stopped being able to charge or clean in the stand. This because the shaver would move around during the cleaning process, tricking the stand into thinking it wasn&#x27;t in the stand at all. I called Braun and was told that I had to ship the unit, at my expense, a few hundred miles to the nearest service center. I also had to call the service center myself to set this up. They would provide no time frame for resolution of the problem. They wouldn&#x27;t guarantee that it was covered by the warranty, so once the service center got it, I could face charges for getting it fixed. And in the meantime I had to buy another shaver.    Check around. This is a common problem with this shaver. For this much money, Braun should treat its customers better. I won&#x27;t be buying from them again, and I suggest you not either.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my husband and these are his thoughts. \\&quot;I have been using this razor for about 1 month now and I would rate this product as very good. It has taken about a month for my face to adjust between the new Braun razor and the Norelco I used previously.\\&quot; He says this razor does give a closer shave than the previous rotery razor, and most notiably has a decreased \\&quot;5 o&#x27;clock shadow\\&quot;. It also has a better trimer.</li>
    <li> My husband has only the use of his left upper extremity &amp; is unable to safely use a razor blade. This allows him some measure of independence. Not as good as blade, of course, but gives a reasonably close shave.</li>
    <li> My husband used his razor for the first time this morning and loved it.  He had the earlier series and wanted to upgrade so we decided that would be an awesome Father&#x27;s Day Gift.  He LOVED it!  We ordered the package with the cleaning refills and the extra replacement head!  He loved it all!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased a Braun Series 7 Pulsonic shaver and did not give me a close enough shave to be satisfactory.</li>
    <li> This is my third and last Braun Pulsonic 9595 shaver I have owned in the last 1 1/2 years.  I have had the same corroding issues with all three shavers, pitting under the foil head, cracking and pealing, flaking of the finish and fading of the engraving.  I clean my shaver daily using only the Braun cleaner following the Braun instructions.  From all the postings and threads on the internet this is not an isolated case.  Before Braun was acquired from Proctor &amp; Gamble I was very happy with products from Braun.  Its either that they are avoiding correction the design problems that are reported on the internet or they look at the cost benefit alanysis and do not see the need to correct what appears to be a common problems with their braun shaver design.   Customer service says the same thing over and over....we have not heard that before please send the razor in for evaluation.  These issues should have been addressed in the poduct development and testing phase or corrected when brought to light.  THIS WILL BE MY LAST BRAUN PRODUCT AND I HAD BEEN A LOYAL BRAUN CUSTOMER FOR OVER TWENTY- FIVE YEARS.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an older braun razor that i had and loved. I definitely like the razor alot and the clean function is awesome.  It is a little pricey considering you are using it to cut hair on your face haha but i still recommend it.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t use electric razors because it tears up my face no matter how long I use it. I pulled this razor out of the box ... ran it through a cleaning cycle... my face was great!! I shave on a regular (Military), so when I can go a fews days without, I do. Here there is a slight problem, but not enough to give a horrible review, it is a little hard to cut longer hairs. Its not much of a problem I just have to alow for more time to shave (thats why it is not much of a problem)... But in all, I love it!! great electric razor!</li>
    <li> I bought the first \\&quot;self-cleaning\\&quot; Braun shaver when it hit the market back in 2000.  It was the Braun Syncro 7570.  I loved that shaver - easily the best I&#x27;d ever used in my life.  It lasted almost 10 years before the trimmer finally got jammed and I had to replace it.  I had all those spare, blue \\&quot;Clean &amp; Renew\\&quot; cartridges lying around, so of course I was going to buy another Braun.    I&#x27;ve been using the Series 7 - 790cc model for about a month now.  It&#x27;s not bad.  It does give a very close shave.  I can see four big downgrades from the Syncro model though:    1) This new Braun hurts my neck hair when I first start shaving - it feels like it&#x27;s yanking my hair like an Epilady womens&#x27; razor or something.    2) The battery life meter on the old Syncro 7570 told me exactly how many minutes of battery life I had remaining so I could manage my last shave accordingly (move faster or slower to finish the shave just as the battery was dying).  This new model just shows 6 battery-life boxes.  If you&#x27;re on the last box, that could mean anywhere from 1-10 minutes remaning.  I dunno.    3) The little pop out trimmer on this Braun sticks out at an odd 90-degree angle.  The old Syncro trimmer stuck out stright-up, parallel with the shaver.  I have a hard time trimming my own neck hair in the back with this new design because it&#x27;s much harder to see over the bulky head of the shaver.    4) Every time I want to clean the 790cc using the base and the cleaning solution, I have to charge the shaver at the same time.  I don&#x27;t like charging batteries until they are completely dead.  The old Syncro gave me the option to clean and/or charge.  This new model just gives you different cleaning settings, but as far as I can tell, they all charge the unit at the same time.  Big design flaw, in my opinion.    So, in conclusion, the Braun shavers are still the best.  I think this newest model gives the closest shave yet.  But given the 4 issues I listed above, I have to give this shaver 4 outof 5 stars.  The old Braun Syncro model was still the king.  That one gets 5-of-5 stars from me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the Braun 790cc for over a year now. The shaver is OK, it does not shave ANY better than the cheapest Braun on the market, or a Philips for that matter. Absolutely no reason to buy. Way too expensive - the shaver as well as the replacement foil.</li>
    <li> I can understand the glowing reviews of the Braun Pulsonic shaver because I had the same feelings when it was new.  It shaves close, and provides a comfortable shave.  I also like the cleaning and charging system (that I&#x27;ve had with previous Braun models).    But the problem is, like the previous Braun products I&#x27;ve owned, it just doesn&#x27;t hold up to daily use.  After 4 months of use the trimmer had to be held down by tape, because it would not fully retract.  At least it was operational during this period.    Then after about a year, part of the trimmer mechanism fell out, and it ceased to function altogether.    In addition, the head-lock function no longer works...    Also, the quality of shave has decreased with time, and although changing the head was an improvement, it is still not as smooth as when it waas new.     I&#x27;m still using it, but now I have to use a different device for trimming my sideburns, which is disappointing for an electric razor that cost over $300 with tax.</li>
    <li> After a few weeks your hair will adjust making this the most comfortable shave ever. Plus it only takes 5 minutes compaired to 10 to 15 and the mess in the sink and razor burn. No more razor bumps or cuts. Self cleaning works great too.</li>
    <li> I have been on a very long quest to find an electric razor that I can use with satisfaction.  This is the first electric razor that did not irritate my neck.  The shaver is not as close as a blade, but perfectly acceptable.  The convenience and cool gadgetry of this razor has made me very happy!</li>
    <li> Let me preface this review by stating that I am a loyal Braun fan and customer and have been for nearly twenty years. This electric razor is my fourth Braun in two decades of shaving with nothing else.    This shaver was a \\&quot;To:Me, From:Me\\&quot; gift meant to replace my old Braun, the former TOL Activator Series. The old shaver still did a good job, but after five years , the battery life was markedly less than previous years and the clean &amp; renew base charger unit needed to be replaced due to a broken latch (common repair complaint). Instead of getting the shaver re-fitted with a new battery and replacing the broken base charger, I figured I&#x27;d put that money towards the new \\&quot;upgraded\\&quot; TOL Pulsonic Model 790 instead. The Amazon \\&quot;rebate\\&quot;, as well as double-triple points on the new Amazon/Chase Visa made the choice a no-brainer, or so I thought.    I must say that, along with fairly constant price hikes, the quality of the shavers has declined drastically. My first two Braun&#x27;s were high-line models and were priced around the $70 and $100 ranges, respectively. They were both clad in mostly stainless steel with only some plastic. My Activator model was mostly plastic with some stainless. The new Pulsonic has ZERO stainless: it is ALL plastic. For a nearly $300(!) MSRP shaver, this is inexcusable. In addition, the new clean &amp; renew charger base may have been simplified over the years in comparison with that of the Activator series bases, with the removal of the tower/latch design that was so problematic, but the aesthetics are lousy. The old \\&quot;metalflake\\&quot; black/dark grey thick plastic of the old base has been replaced by the cheapest el crappo dingy grey paper-thin plastic...it always looks dusty-dirty! It really looks and feels cheap and the color of it matches nothing on the shaver (or nothing else in my bathroom for that matter, LOL!). The shaver case quality has nosedived as well. My first two Brauns had padded hard zipppered nicely-lined cases covered in leatherette (\\&quot;pleather\\&quot;) with a built in shaving mirror, cleaning supplies and clear hard plastic foil cover. The Activator, at nearly double the MSRP got by with a pleather soft pouch, cheapo cleaning brush and foil cover. The new Pulsonic clear hard-plastic clamshell cover (with no room for anything else excepting a cheap cleaning brush) that looks like something the repair dept. puts on a shaver that came in with no case or on a refurbished unit. INEXCUSABLE for $300! Have you ck&#x27;ed the price for the new foil/cutter head replacement? It&#x27;s nearly DOUBLE that of the prior TOL series&#x27;s! Since they need replacement often (depending on beard toughness, shave frequency and whether or not the foil tears), add that to your operating bill along with the clean &amp; renew cartridge refills.       It&#x27;s slightly quieter than the older models duing shaving despite the new vibratory motion, but noiser during cleaning. The LCD Hygiene and Battery monitors (Model 790) are nice, as is the chrome foil/cutterblock combo plating, but the rest of the shaver is plastic and looks cheap. If you were expecting a \\&quot;statement\\&quot; shaver to set off your expensive stately Master Bath, this ain&#x27;t it (unless the statement you wanted to make is \\&quot;Hey look, I spent a fortune on an overpriced plastic POS! LOL!). Frankly, I don&#x27;t see an appreciable difference in shave closeness compared to my last Braun with both the original Activator foil/cutterblock or the \\&quot;updated\\&quot; 360 foil/cutterblock combo that I \\&quot;upgraded\\&quot; from. The shave is slightly more comfortable as the new foil design presents slightly less friction on your beard, but that&#x27;s it. Additionally, the new trimmer is awkward to use (it now sticks-out perpendicularly from the mid point of the shaver front instead of inline with the cutter head as with all previous Braun models. It is cheaply made with longevity not, apparently, a major design goal.     Finally, I don&#x27;t know when Gillette bought Braun, but it&#x27;s apparent to me that the resultant product of their parentage is to make the most expensive and best shavers on the market just the most expensive. Quality is out, while pricing is up. Do what you wish...it&#x27;s your money...but, having been there/done that/paid for it, I&#x27;d seek-out a cheaper Braun Model and save the exorbitant cost of this very gimmicky shaver. This is truly a case of \\&quot;Style Over Substance\\&quot;. I&#x27;m sure this review won&#x27;t be appreciated (my negative comments usually aren&#x27;t), but I calls &#x27;em as I sees &#x27;em! For my money, I want to know if a product is less-than what it is portrayed as in an advertisement. Hopefully, you do too.      Addendum: If you like your razor sanitary, you will be disappointed. With past self-cleaning Braun&#x27;s i.e., those with a separate foil and cutterblock, the clean and charge cartridge did a decent job of cleaning and lubing the cutting system. With the Pulsonic models, the combo one-piece foil/cutterblock allows detritus to be trapped within itself. Understand that I daily dissassemble and tap-out the excess whiskers and rinse the cutter under the sink BEFORE I use the clean and charge base auto clean. Despite this, the cutter (with it&#x27;s myriad of nooks and crannies) remains filthy...a poor design!     Update (7/22/09): FYI, the \\&quot;Clean &amp; Charge\\&quot; base station disemboweled itself this morning. While I use the auto clean function every day, I noticed my shaver was damp and didn&#x27;t smell of the cleaning fluid like it normally does. I shaved, then put the shaver in the base and pressed the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; button. After less than a minute, a big puddle appeared under the unit. I picked it up and found it was the fluid from the cleaning cartridge. I cleaned everything up and tried again...this time it emptied the cartridge (it was replaced this past week, so it was fresh)! I also noticed that the LED that signals \\&quot;empty\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t work either. Braun&#x27;s answer: \\&quot;We&#x27;re really sorry sir, take the unit and drive or ship it to the nearest service center (30-60mi away) for REPAIR\\&quot;...notice I didn&#x27;t say that they were sending me a NEW (or re-man unit, for that matter) REPLACMENT! \\&quot;You can use the power cord to charge the (dirty and getting dirtier) shaver in the meanwhile, Sir\\&quot;! WOW! Great customer service on a $300 shaver! I&#x27;ll update the sorry saga as it unfolds. On another note, the \\&quot;rebate\\&quot; that Amazon promised would be issued never came. I have to call them and get aggravated some more.     I AM TRULY SORRY THAT I EVER PURCHASED THIS THING. Buyer BEWARE!</li>
    <li> This is not meant to be an elaborate review, but here are my thoughts on the shaver:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cleaning station:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good: Very useful and gets everything cleaned up for the most part. One still needs to use the brush to take care of the small hair, but that&#x27;s easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;The Bad: Can get a little bit expensive with time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Trimmer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only Good: The trimmer on this shaver is extremely powerful. I used it fairly often to shape my beard and it did an amazing job. It made it seem as if I actually shaved my neck and the areas I cleaned up! Still impresses me every single time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good: Very Strong and really good for sensitive skin. I have tried every shaver possible and razors prior to using this shaver, and I have an awful response to anything that shaves my neck. This was the only thing that prevented me of getting the burns and going through the regular pains I used to go through whenever I tried to shave in the past. The only thing about this though is that I had to shave every day or every other day to not get the irritation. I had to shave more often to get rid of the irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad: I sometimes don&#x27;t get the close shave I would like to get. I get a good shave, but again nothing like a razor. This might change later on with time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this shaver for 4 years and it has been in very good shape, so although it might be expensive. It is definitely worth the money if you struggle to shave on a daily basis --this is for the sensitive skin guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes:&lt;br /&gt;1. Give the shaver around a month for your skin to get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;2.Change the head every year or year and a half depending on how many times you use it.&lt;br /&gt;3. Close the lead for the cleaning liquid thingy after you use it so the alcohol doesn&#x27;t evaporate. That will save you a lot of money!</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver. Best I have ever used! I&#x27;ll never buy another brand.</li>
    <li> I used this for about two years. It was fine for a while, and then the charger went on the fritz. While I was waiting for a replacement, I went back to using old-school blades and cream and haven&#x27;t looked back. I hadn&#x27;t used a non-electric razor since 1997, but things have really changed. The Gillette Fushion Proglide is excellent, permitting a much closer shave (than this Braun or any electric razor) and not nicking your skin as the old razors did.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver because of the Braun name. It&#x27;s rubbish! Not a close shave when it worked. And now the cleaning housing does not work. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I will stick with Panasonic for a better shave and longer life.</li>
    <li> The best razor I have ever had. A little loud especially on cleaning cycles but overall the best. Regular cleaning and lubrication is a great idea and feature.</li>
    <li> I have used this shaver for six months now, and it works great!  Shaves very closely especially under the nose, where most 3-circle rotary shavers cannot even touch (i.e Norelco)!    My only complaint is that the cleaning fluid (contained in the charger/cleaner base) can be tasted on your lips after shaving.  For this I need to remember to wash my lips off lest my food tastes like a butane lighter.    Hopefully, it&#x27;s not too toxic...right Braun? :-(</li>
    <li> you pay for what you get!!! wonderfu, totally worth your money!!! amazon shipped right on time!</li>
    <li> Good shaver. Made in Germany. Very close shaving, but lock broke down very first day.It does not affect shaving, but it is bad, not reliable design. I read some reviews before about broken locks, but could never imagine it would happen to me and it did as I said at very first day. After I found that actually plastic pin broke on that lock I did very stupid thing trying to fix it. I glued this pin by \\&quot;Crazy glue\\&quot; to lock and it was ok. But after first cleaning, I guess, glue melted ( because of heat and alcohol in cleaning liquid) and now lock slider sticks forever to shaving head.  I will say again, it does not affect shaving and it still perfect, just be careful with lock.</li>
    <li> I have never used a foil type head before.  It does a very good job but takes a bit longer than the rotary head shavers I have had for the past 35 years.  It takes some time to get used to this unit.  I have no disappointments other than the price.  Operationally, the unit is excellent.  I don&#x27;t like the cleaning feature because it is not needed.  Having it doesn&#x27;t affect performance, it is just a wonderment that is not necessary.  Overall, I rate this unit as very good.  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars due to price and the unnecessary cleaning feature.  Otherwise the unit is excellent.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco rotaries for 10 years (850RX and 975RX) and they did a decent job.  Then I switched to the manual blade razors (Gillette mach 3 and the Fusion) for the past 12 years mainly for the close shave.    My manual shave took me 20-25 minutes for a full clean shave. Stage one: with the grain,stage 2: against the grain, stage 3: touchups at different angles to make sure that the skin is silky smooth.  This is the perfect shave and for a scale of reference be considered a 10.    Because of how long this took,I wanted something a lot quicker.  SO I read all the so called positive reviews on the Braun 790cc and its high ratings and tried it for 3 weeks.      First off, you cannot compare it to a manual blade.  I do not think any electric can compare.    For the $200 plus I spent on this product, I thought it would do a lot better.  Folks it does a very average job of shaving.      Yes, its cleaning system works perfectly but that&#x27;s not what I look for in a electric shaver...I buy it for its shaving performance, not its cleaning abilities.    I had to spend over 15 minutes going over the same areas, ESPECIALLY the neck/chin areas several times and it still did not clean it up and left stubble.  Then I pressed into my skin and basically having to apply pressure and repeat so many times, caused much greater skin irritation and bumps than a manual blade.  My wife asked me what I did to my face and neck...it was red and bumpy.  And YES, it did draw blood frequently with cuts.  My hand would be tired with all the physical exertion.    A blade could have given me a perfect shave in just a few strokes.  sure a blade will have a few nicks and minor cuts, but that goes away after a quick shower.    I decided to try my 20 YEAR OLD NORELCO 850RX that was sitting in my drawer with its old original blades.  I shaved half of my face with the Norelco and the other half with the Braun.  The Norelco was FASTER and the results were identical!!  The old norelco actually shavedsome areas closer than the Braun.    This to me is not worth the $250 you might pay for the Braun.    Conclusion:  Over half the cost of the Braun is for the cleaning system.  then the other 20% is for all the marketing hype.  You are left with a razor that&#x27;s really only worth $35!!  You may as well get a $10 no-name rotary and it will give you the same performance.    I am stunned at the hundreds of \\&quot; 5 star reviews\\&quot;. Just do a google on\\&quot;Amazon fake Reviews\\&quot;.  Especially when a lot of these reviewers list \\&quot;the motor is too loud\\&quot; as the con for this product, it makes me wonder how real this is.  You have to list some &#x27;con&#x27; for the product, why not just list something as harmless as &#x27;too loud&#x27;...please!!!    Braun has big bucks.  it does not cost them too much to hire employees or writers to post favorable reviews on this product.    Also, do a search on reviews on any competing shaver and you will see all of them with reviews that are mostly 5 star heavy.  How can all of these shaver reviews state \\&quot;the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had&#x27;???  unbelievable.    I&#x27;m not giving up on electrics yet.  I just picked up a Panasonic Arc IV Nano.  I&#x27;ll let you know how that compares in a few weeks. I did return my over priced Braun though.</li>
    <li> Outstanding item!  Best shaver that I have EVER owned!  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this machine!  --Steve Gilbert  Denver</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried different razors and this one really works well.  I was a little worried about spending the money and it not working good.  I did read the reviews and I guess it just depends on your face.  Like everything else out there one thing works better for some than for others.  I would recommend at least trying it, if it doesn&#x27;t work for you then send it back.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Faster shaving time.&lt;br /&gt;Closer shave than previous razors. (The only closer shave I have had is from a straight edge)&lt;br /&gt;Less passes and subsequently less irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer is easy to keep clean.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent battery so far. (only have been using it a few months.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harder to clean trimmer head than previous models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this razor after the cleaning station of my last one died. I&#x27;m now using my old Braun foil razor for travel and just washing it with water. I obviously liked my last one enough to get the newer model. I have a few extremely coarse whiskers from time to time and this razor can handle them. I have used several electric razors in the past (foil and rotary) and would get frustrated after a dozen passes and end up pulling thick hairs with a tweezer. This one will cut them! One thing about this model that I don&#x27;t know how I feel about is the cutting blades come off when you remove the head. It was easier to dump out clippings with the older models. I thought the Pulsonic technology was gimmicky when I was reading up on the latest models but there must be something to it as this does a quicker cleaner job. I like the pop out trimmer on this model better than the older models as it is easier to clean. People complain about having to replace the cartridges but what I do is wash them out once they have been used and fill them half way with 80% isopropyl alcohol then the other half with water. This way you can get a few months out of it. It may not be factory recommended but it seems to work fine. Over all, I am very happy with this razor and have recommended to several people.</li>
    <li> This is the third electric shaver I have had. My very first shaver was a cheap Braun foil shaver, and it served me well for years, and would not give up. But then I \\&quot;upgraded\\&quot; to the Norelco three oscillating blade type - that was an expensive piece of junk. About a year ago, I bought this Braun 7-790cc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver works great and gives me a really close shave just like Braun is known for. The foil flexes well to really adapt to your skin - really much better than those oscillating heads on competing models. The shaver is light and well proportioned to easily control, and the grip edges are good if you happen to be shaving with slightly wet hands. The trimmer works well and is convenient to engage (albeit a bit too easy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver display, controls, and cleaning system are great displaying both the battery life as well as the hygiene of the shaver. About once a week, I stick the shaver into its box and push the big button. It does it&#x27;s own thing, and within about an hour it is all clean, charged up and ready to go. The kit comes with a holder for the shaver to take it on trips, and I have gone two weeks on a single charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have had is that sometimes, when I re-handle the shaver, sometimes I inadvertently switch on the trimmer, but this is a minor thing and has no bearing on the performance of the shaver. This is an excellent shaver, and even though I never thought I would spend over $200 for a shaver, this one was a good investment. I am sure it will serve me well for years to come.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shaver.  He&#x27;s had it for 2.5 year when the base suddenly would&#x27;t charge the shaver anymore. I removed the cleaning solution and tried cleaning the base thinking that maybe dirt or something had gotten stuck inside.  No such luck. The base unit lights up but won&#x27;t charge. Finally unplugged it from the base and plugged it directly into the shaver so he could use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base is expensive to replace. Like at least $70.  Search ebay and other sites for a replacement base and found a place in Virginia Beach, VA called Commonwealth Electric Shavers. Purchased it online for $57 including tax and shipping. For a shaver that almost $300 it should definitely last longer.</li>
    <li> Excellent product to replace my old braun shaver that i had for about 7 years.  Love all the new features.</li>
    <li> I have a very sensitive skin and Braun series 7 makes it so easy to shave and look fresh and clean</li>
    <li> Did a lot of research on this shaver and it seemed great. At first it was everything they promised. Great shaver with a good cleaning system. Mind you, I purchased this model specifically for the cleaning functionality.  Fast forward 1 year later and everything turned bad. First, the cleaner. It would never go through an entire cleaning cycle, instead it would start cleaning by pumping the fluid into the chamber. Then after 5 minutes of activity it would stop making any noisy even though the LED clearly said cleaning. This process used to take longer than that. Worst of all when it was done cleaning there was still fluid and hair in the chamber.... gross.  I sent it in 3 times under warranty (paying shipping one way each time) and it was never fully fixed. Then the shaver wasn&#x27;t cutting as well as it used to; it pulled out more hairs than it cut which was really painful. I went ahead and purchased a new cassette thinking the blades were dull, but it still didn&#x27;t work well. If you read some of the reviews on the cassettes you can see plenty of users complaining of the shaver pulling hairs.  Finally I tried contacting Braun customer service for help/replacement/anything, all they would say is to send it in. I&#x27;m sorry but for a $250+ shaver I expect much more than that.  Now I&#x27;ve turned to the excellent Philips Norelco 1250 shaving system and it is great. No pulling hairs. Much better simpler cleaning system (it doesn&#x27;t use a pump) which hopefully means more reliability. I chose Philips because I have been using their sonicare toothbrushes for years and I trust the brand.

    <li> so i bought one of these from amazon, very early adopter.  it is very similar in general to earlier clean and charge foil shavers from braun,  of which my last one was unceramoniously dumped in the garbage after a year for a rotary   from phillips, which was used for about another year and then dumped for the 4-blade gillette razor.  but now i&#x27;m back to trying electric for no particular reason other than it is tiresome buying   razor blade that have been specially engineered to need replacing after a week of use.  plus, while no matter what the manufacturers will tell you, there is no electric razor that  shaves as close as a blade, though sometimes the blade shaves a little too close...causing cuts, razor burn,  ingrown hairs, etc. it&#x27;s enough to make a guy want to grow a beard.    enter the braun pulsonic. this is basically a very well-made, high end \\&quot;activator\\&quot; or \\&quot;complete 360\\&quot;  with the added feature that it vibrates. i suppose this is the same technology in the gillette \\&quot;power\\&quot; series  and other regular razors that use a AAA battery to vibrate as they shave...it does result in a ever-so-slightly  better shave. so this foil, which uses the nice almost-random pattern of differently-sized holes for diffent hairs (which was avail. only in germany for a long time, for some reason, then appeared in the u.s. with the braun 360) has a nice pivoting head, standard little pop-out trimmer, and vibrates like a sonicare toothbrush while you shave. the vibration is not really noticable over the regular noise and vibration present in a regular electric razor, but the results seem to speak for themselves. it seems to be a much gentler, more effective electric razor than i have used in a long time. the only thing is, it isn&#x27;t a blade. after spending several passes with it over my cheek, for example, i can still run my hand against the growth and feel a little stubble there, which is never the case with the razor blade. on the other hand, i expect that over time there will be less shaving irritation, so it&#x27;s not a bad trade off. the thing to note is that it&#x27;s really made to be used with the little \\&quot;charge and clean\\&quot; cartridges, which according to braun last for 30 shaves, so each one lasts a month.  at $4 per cartridge, it&#x27;s not too great an expense. word of warning though: if you take the razor out of the charger before it&#x27;s finished the cleaning cycle (easy to do since much of it is silent, if you don&#x27;t wait for the &#x27;clean&#x27; light to come on) and sometimes even if you wait for it to be clean, and just start shaving, you may experience the unique and painful feeling of shaving with a small amount of rubbing alcohol on the razor foil.   i recommend making sure it&#x27;s quite dry before use, shake it a little or blow on th foil or something.  the clean and charge flud is a lemon-scented alcohol and lubricant solution that you don&#x27;t want touching newly-shaven skin.      overall, it seems to be a good investment. the razor is well-made for sure, very solid, with a rubber grip handle on the back that is pretty comfortable to hold. it moves very easily over the face, even with 3-day stubble, and is noticably more comfortable than other electrics i&#x27;ve used. i think it will take about 2 weeks for the skin/hair to get used to it again, but...good-bye razor blades! hello pulsonic!</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with an electric razor for most of my adult life.   Being 48 years old, that is a lot of shaving.  I gave up the blade shortly after college as I grew tired of cutting myself.      At the time I could not afford a Braun razor (nor do I even know if they existed) so I went with something my father had - a Norelco 3 head rotary shaver.  This actually worked well with no irritation, but did not really get close enough and had trouble with areas around chin, etc.   After about 10 years the razor up and died.      Having gotten my money&#x27;s worth I then decided to buy another similar Norelco.  Was very happy with that one until about 2 months ago when it started to \\&quot;die\\&quot;.  It would stop shaving in the middle of a shave, but then come back on.   I knew it would not be long until it died.    This time out I did more research and raised my budget.  Reading all the reviews (and consumer reports) I knew I would go with the Braun.  I loved the idea that it cleans itself too.  Having many models to choose from, I stumbled upon this one which seemed to be getting rave reviews.    Placed my order, received it quickly, and had it in the charging base that night.    The next morning I shaved and did notice a slight discomfort.  It was a very close shave and perhaps this was why.  I also know that it takes time for your face to \\&quot;get used to\\&quot; a new razor.   I think the real thing is that my beard/face/throat was a mess because I was shaving with that old electric that would stop in the middle and go off and on.  Over a few days it got better and better.  I love the feel of this razor and the self cleaning feature.    The only thing I do not fully understand is why the unit has never told me to clean it.  I use it daily and it only takes a few minutes to shave - 5 minutes tops.  When I put it back in the charger it still says it is clean.  I guess I do not have that much of a beard and that is why.  I just go ahead and use the quick clean button as the instructions say to clean daily.      All in all, a great razor.  A bit on the expensive side, but I figure it will last many years, so well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Well, it&#x27;s been about a week since i picked up the 9595CC and I&#x27;m already impressed.  I&#x27;ve used several electrics before and never satisfied but this one seems to be giving me a better and better shave each time I use it as my skin gets used to it...Cost is high but worth it for someone like me with stubble every day.</li>
    <li> As someone who has used electric razors for almost 15 years now, I can honestly say this is by far the closest shave i have ever had.  With past razors, I have only been able to get a close shave if I waited a couple of days first.  With the Pulsonic, it does not matter -- I can shave once a day, twice, etc. and I get the same close shave every time.      This product really is a good investment.  I am someone who used to joke that I get 3 o&#x27;clock shadows, not just 5.  With this product, I look like I just shaved with my old Norelco right before bed.</li>
    <li> The Braun Pulsonic is the best shaving system I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s not perfect, but it is far and away superior to the Philishaves and Panasonics that have proven lacking for me over my past ten years of electric shaving. Philishave always gave me a neck rash, and Panasonic didn&#x27;t shave the neck cleanly at all, ever, wet or dry. Blade shaves have always left me with a neck rash, so I persisted with electric systems. Yes, the Braun is expensive, and as I said, it&#x27;s not perfect, but with a bit of practice you can achieve a great shave which lasts a good 24 hours, for me. The most thorough shave is achieved &#x27;wet&#x27;, however I can understand why the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t promote this. It would be easy to clog the blade heads with too much foam, so you need to apply this sparingly, ( I use soap-free), and keep rubbing water into your beard until you have more water than soap. If you can master this, you will agree this shaver is a major step forward to shaving nirvana. And I would like to leave a plug for Amazon. My order was processed with lightning efficiency, and arrived in Australia speedily, and in one piece.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000XTGOIA Braun 9595 Pulsonic Series Shaver]]&lt;br /&gt;This is a by-far better electric razor than the one I had been using. I&#x27;m generally not too impressed by electric razors. They just don&#x27;t do the job a blade razor does. However, I have to say that the Braun 9595 does shave as well as a blade. The self-cleaning feature is nice, too. I&#x27;d often let my previous razor go too long without cleaning but with the Braun you can see how dirty it is and decide to clean it based upon the sensors in the docking device. I&#x27;m sure that helps keep the shaves close and comfortable as well. Not cheap but for my money well worth it.</li>
    <li> Great shave. Best I&#x27;ve ever experienced with an electric shaver. Beard trimmer inconvenient to use. Cleaning system wasteful.</li>
    <li> this is a great shaver. i reccommend it for anyone that enjoys using a electric shaver because it cuts just about every hair in only but one stroke.GREAT SHAVER FOR THE PRICE</li>
    <li> I HOPE YOU WILL GET SOME GOOD SOLID INFO FROM MY REVIEW.  FIRST, I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I HAVE TRIED MANY ELECTRIC SHAVERS OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS.  I HATE SHAVING WITH A BLADE SO I WANTED TO FIND THE BEST SHAVER.  I DO NOT WORK FOR PANASONIC NOR BRAUN.  MY REVIEW IS HONEST AND I HAVE PUT ALOT OF TIME AND RESEARCH INTO THESE PRODUCTS, LOOKING FOR THE BEST SHAVER.  I TESTED THE BRAUN PULSONIC 9595 SHAVER, AND ALSO THE PANASONIC VORTEX NANO ES 8109S FOR 30 DAYS.  THE BRAUN I BOUGHT FOR 250 DOLLARS, THE PANASONIC VORTEX WAS ABOUT 130 DOLLARS.  I ALSO USED THE PANASONIC 8077, WHICH IS DISCONTINUED AND ABOUT 40 DOLLARS ON THE INTERNET OR EBAY.  I BOUGHT IT FROM SHARPER IMAGE FOR 99 DOLLARS MONTHS AGO.  AGAIN, NOW WORTH ABOUT 40 BUCKS.    THE BRAUN DOES TONS OF MARKETING, MAKING BELIEVE THE PULSONIC MUST BE THE BEST SHAVER ON THE MARKET.  IT IS A GREAT SHAVER AND REALLY WORKED PRETTY WELL.  BUT THERE IS NO CONTEST.  THE PANASONIC MODELS SHAVED MUCH CLOSER AND FOR ABOUT HALF THE PRICE.  THE BRAUN DID OK ON THE NECK AREA BUT THE PANASONIC WON THE CONTEST.  THE BRUAN WANTS YOU TO CLEAN THE UNIT EVERY FEW SHAVES, THAT GETS EXPENSIVE WHILE YOU MUST USE ITS CLEANING CARTRIDGE/SYSTEM.  THE PANASONIC GIVES YOU THE SAME CLEANING SYSTEM BUT ALSO ALLOWS YOU TO USE THE WATER FROM YOUR SINK.  ITS A WET AND DRY UNIT.  THE PANASONIC BY FAR IS THE BETTER SHAVER AND MUCH CHEAPER PRICE WISE.  I GUESS BRAUN CHARGES ALOT BECAUSE OF THERE EXPENSIVE MARKETING CAMPAIGN.  IF I COMPARED THE PANASONIC 8077 TO THE MORE EXPENSIVE 8109, I MUST ADMIT, THEY SHAVE THE SAME.  THE 8109 HAS NEWER TECHNOLOGY, FANCIER BUTTONS AND A CLEANING SYSTEM, BUT JUST COMPARING THE ACUAL SHAVE, THEY PERFORM THE SAME.  YOU PAY MORE FOR THE 8109 BECAUSE IT HAS MORE BELLS AND WHISTLES.  I HOPE THIS REVIEW HELPS.  IN CONCLUSION, DO NOT FALL PREY TO ALL THE MARKETING HYPE BY BRAUN OR PANASONIC.  JUST BECAUSE THE RAZORS GET FANCIER AND HAVE MORE BELLS AND WHISTLES, DOES NO MEAN THEY SHAVE BETTER.  AGAIN, I WOULD CERTAINLYGO FOR THE PANASONIC MODELS OVER THE BRAUN.  BEST WISHES WITH YOUR NEW SHAVER.  I AM VERY HAPPY, MY RESEARCH IS OVER, I AM STICKING WITH THE ES 8077E, AND 8109E.  IT OUT PERFORMS THE 250 DOLLAR EXPENSIVE MODEL BY BRAUN CALLED THE PULSONIC.  HOPE THIS HELPS.</li>
    <li> I really thought it was a great shaver, but it is not. It won&#x27;t cut every hair in my face as they said in the advertaisment. My 70 dls. Remington is alot better (Yes that is correct). I am going to keep it just because I am not aloud to return it to amazon because it has the liquid and it is flammable (even though it is not open). I like amazon but this time I got disapointed.</li>
    <li> Costs about 200 bucks I&#x27;d say they spent half of that on the packaging.  It shaves most of your hairs fine its just some on the neck dont get cut. Also can&#x27;t be used in the shower which is a great place to shave hairs.  I&#x27;ve only used it once and I don&#x27;t like it. My old panasonic is much much better.</li>
    <li> ok - my first Braun was over 15 years ago.  My next was the 7000 series.  I used it daily for 6 years and was pretty happy.  Nothing to brag about.  But it started to give out despite changing the cutter block and foil routinely.  The battery was losing its charge, and i think was also less powerful, leading to a worse shave.  Then recently i was at Costco and they had a great price on an 8000 series / 360.  I was amazed at how much better it was.  But i didn&#x27;t know about the Pulsonic.  Needing the latest and greatest, i bought the Pulsonic from Amazon.  The first couple days i was not too impressed - i did not think it was any better than the 8000.  But then i realized the next mornings that my face was much closer than it had ever been with the previous models (I used the 8000 for 2 weeks).  However, i do not think that the Pulsonic does a better job on my neck than the 8000 did - maybe even a little worse.  I think that the beard / sideburn trimmer on the Pulsonic is LOUSY compared to that of the 7/8000.  I like the grip on the Pulsonic better than the 7/8000.  I like the fact that there is a quick clean cycle.  I hate the fact that the cartridges are more expensive (from $18 for the 7000 to $30 for the pulsonic). The pulsonic feels a little rougher during the shave than the 8000, but that is probably because of the pulsations.  I use remington shave powder sticks.  So i&#x27;ll keep the Pulsonic.    POSITIVE speak for themselves  NEGATIVES are higher cost, more expensive cartridges, no hard plastic cover for the shave heads (only a large case for the whole thing), the machines desire to tell you to clean it every day. and most importantly (and the reason for losing a star) the LOUSY beard/sideburn trimmer.  I&#x27;ll keep it, and I hope it give me a good 5 years.</li>
    <li> This Braun pulsonic system provides the closest shave for an electric shaver. I agree it also has a nice handle, even for a lefty. My only complaint was the mechanism for changing the mobility of the head. It is a small silver plastic switch that broke after three shaves! Fortunately, it does not change the closeness of the shave. But the head is stuck in one position. For the heavy price tag I expected a better product. Hope I do not encounter any other problems.</li>
    <li> Ingrown hairs were always a real problem with the Mach 3&#x27;s of the world but electric razors never gave me a close enough shave.  Until now.  The Braun Pulsonic is as close to a razor shave as possible without any of the irritation.  Sometimes you need to manually shave a random hair or two when you are done but the Pulsonic is very impressive.  I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Does all that is advertised. Leaves no mess and has indicators for hygiene and battery life. I feel the accessories are currently a little overpriced, but that is no reason for me to return this nifty little shaver.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my husband.  He has a very tough beard and is always looking for the best shaver.  He is happy with the smooth, close shave he gets from his Braun Pulsonic Shaver.</li>
    <li> I previously owned a brawn shaver before this one. This new Braun does an even better job and is quieter as well. I think it&#x27;s well worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> I have had mine for 2 months now and have no complaints.  It gives a very close shave--not quite as close as a blade--but more than makes up for that slight drawback with incredible ease of use and time savings!    Using the Braun instead of a regular razor cuts my shave time in half every morning.  Believe it or not this is a big deal.  Couple that with the time saved cleaning (just put it back in the base and it is cleaned and charged for your next use) and you have a great combination of good closeness and outstanding efficiency.  The cleaning cartridge lasted about 30-35 days using it everyday.  You can of course choose to clean it as often or infrequently as you like.    Overall this razor performs nicely giving a good shave with little or no irritation and does it fast.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27; ve shaved all my life using razor blades. I had a lot of irritations and cuts after a shave, not always but most of the time. Now for the first time I buy an electric razor and i went for the top of the line. I&#x27;ve only used the thing 5 times so far and I have to say that the results are not much different than the razor blade ones. Yes, under the neck the shave is not as clean ad the rest of the face is. But than again even with razor blades I had the same results most of the time.  I wash my face with warm water and dry it, than wash it again with cold water and dry it. Than I shave with my Pulsonic. 5 mins later I have a smooth and clean shaved face. Tap the cutting head on the sink to get rid of most of the hairs in it, stick it in the recharging/cleaning unit and hit a button. Next time I&#x27;ll use it it will be as new as the first time I&#x27;ve used it.  I dont know if in one month the thing will be working still the same...I hope so. But for now I am really happy with the results.  Altho If it wasnt for the ease of carrying it around when i travel I would still stick with the razor blades...280 dollars of blades last u a lifetime!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my husband and we both love the close shave it gives.  The self clean features are pretty cool especially since it requires little to no effort on the part of the user though it is on the loud side (using and cleaning).  The only real complaints are cost - it&#x27;s the most expensive shaver we&#x27;ve ever purchased and the base takes up counter space.  Other than that, well worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> I have been using Panasonic Shavers for over 10 years now and have, until recently, thought they were the best. The latest Panasonic razors seem to be more cheaply made and do not shave as well as the ones that proceeded them.   So I decided to try the Braun...and was extremely skeptical of the manufacturer&#x27;s claims. I shouldn&#x27;t have been. The Pulsonic is a great shaver. Its relatively quiet, solidly built and most importantly, very effective at shaving my beard.   The base which cleans the unit is effective as well.   Yes, its more expensive that other shavers but I think its worth it.   Recommended</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Braun Pulsonic 9595 with a little skepticism as it was the first time I had ever purchased an electric razor. I wasn&#x27;t quite sure whether it would shave as close as a razor like some reviewers indicated. I was pleasantly surprised that it not only shaves as close as a razor but also does not cause any irritation. I have no doubt that over the long run my skin will be much better off. Please note that I do not have a real thick beard and mustache but shaving is much more pleasurable now than it was with a razor.</li>
    <li> I like this razor very much. It shaves closer and without the skin irritation then the Braun 8995 I purchased a year ago. I do not regret buying this shaver, and would do so again without hesitation.</li>
    <li> The Braun is outstanding. My only criticism is that the cleaning system is jarringly noisy.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS RAZOR.  It is about 30% - 50% faster than the Norelco 9160 XL.  It also shaves closer and more consistently.  The cleaning system is a little bulky, but it works very well and offers several different cleaning options, which is nice.  And, the razor can be cleaned wet, if necessary.  However, it is noisier and has a lot more vibration than the Norelco.  Even though it has rubber grips, it does vibrate, but not enough to downgrade the razor.  I have tried just about every type/brand/kind of electric razor over the past 25 years (I have never used a blade) and this is the best so far.  The razor is expensive, and it&#x27;s WORTH EVERY PENNY.</li>
    <li> My shaver arrived with a torn foil and a broken blade.  Amazon refused to accept a return or send a replacement shaver head \\&quot;because the shaver is shipped with a dangerous liquid\\&quot; (one cartridge of cleaning fluid). This is the lamest and stupidest excuse I have ever heard for a company to refuse to replace a defective part.     I could not get through the Amazon system to get any resolution.  In fact, I could not even get a human being to respond .      I ended up having to contact Braun directly.  It took  7 calls and over 3 weeks to get a head replacement from them. In the process I lost the opportunity for the 30-day return trial period, let alone wasting hours of my valuable time, and one less month of warranty protection.     Amazon&#x27;s attitude and complete lack of customer  support for a defective product is unconscionable. Amazon SUCKS and so do all their links for shavers.  My advice to you is DO NOT BUY A SHAVER THROUGH AMAZON. Purchase it from someone else.</li>
    <li> I have a very heavy beard. I have to shave every other day. My best shaving results come from a soap (Van Der Hagen Hypo Allergenic Shave Soap), brush (Maison Person Super Badger) and the Schick Quattro razor. The Braun Pulsonic System 9595 is the next best thing. This is truly a fantastic shaver. Well designed and well built, it does the job better than any other electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  I upgraded from another Braun electric shaver (the 6550) which I enjoyed using (for almost 7 years) but was never totally satisfied with the shaving results. It was also well made and well constructed with great user friendly features. The shave (on the 6550) was good but never that close.  Also, it required careful cleaning (after each use) and regular replacement of the cutter block and screen to obtain optimum results. The 9595 is another matter altogether! It&#x27;s truly revolutionary. Not as close a blade but very, very good. It has excellent features (such as a compact travel case), a novel cleaning system (which you can select to use or not to use), a well written and easy to understand instruction manual and is not as loud as my previous Braun. Also, you can clean it under the tap. I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase especially because the price on Amazon was exceptional.</li>
    <li> I bought a Norelco last time and it lasted a year and gave out. I went back to a regular razor using the Gillette Mach III. My wife did some reseach online and purchased the Braun Pulsonic 9585. This has given me the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had which is far superior to the Mach III razor or Norelco. I have a very dark beard and this leaves me smooth as silk and I can go longer between shaves. I&#x27;ve had the Braun since Christmas 2007 and it&#x27;s great. I can go a little over a month before I need a new cleaning cartridge. I&#x27;m glad my wife did the research and it&#x27;s been the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned and I think of her everytime I use it.     Thank you honey. :)</li>
    <li> It is the best. Even though it is very costly, it has given me the closest shave ever. It was a bit tough to get the hairs on the neck, but after some repetitions, it got all of it.</li>
    <li> So far the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had.   Less passes to get a close shave, no need to stretch my skin.     A couple gotchas that could have been made clearer.     The head is totally enclosed which means that you cannot clean the blades with the normal brush.  You must use the auto-cleaner to clean the razor which means you are locked into buying the Braun cleaner refills.  Luckily they are not very expensive and you can get them her for about $15 for a 3 pack.       Also, instead of replacing the foil and/or blades separately you must replace the entire head assembly after about 18 months.  Again, not expensive (about 35 bucks) but that can &#x27;end of life&#x27; the shaver if Braun stops making the replacements.     Either way, other than the above, once I shaved with it I forgot everything else.  IMHO, the inconveniences of having the big table stand, the refills and the very sensitive &#x27;hygienic&#x27; mode (faking you into cleaning it more often) are far out-weighed by the best shaver that Braun, or anyone else, has developed so far!</li>
    <li> This shaver only does a good job if I literally shave every day.  If I skip a day or two (which I often do), then forget it... it will miss half of the hair it goes over with each pass meaning I have to make 10+ passes with my skin pulled taut on every part of my face making sure I try passing in different directions and with the razor held just right before there&#x27;s even a chance that I&#x27;ll have gotten everything.  Even then I&#x27;ll find some missed hairs that I have to go back with the beard trimmer or my manual razor and tackle.    It ends up taking twice as long to shave with this than with my Mach 3, and again often times I just end up doing a touch up with the Mach 3 after spending way too long with the Pulsonic 9595.    So really this razor only conveniences me in the least when I&#x27;m shaving daily which I don&#x27;t really care to do since my beard comes in pretty light and slow and I can pass the light scruff look for a day or two between shaves.    Oh, also the stupid cleaning fluid sensor has been telling me it&#x27;s &#x27;low&#x27; since about the second time I cleaned it, and has told me a few times now that it&#x27;s empty despite the fact that when I remove the fluid canister, it&#x27;s still over half full.  It will not self-clean when it thinks it&#x27;s empty so I have to tilt it forward to fool the sensor, then hit the button while it&#x27;s fooled, and then put it back on the counter.    What a waste of money this was!</li>
    <li> First, let me say that I am previous owner of an Braun 8000 series system and I decided to upgrade to the 9595 model.  I&#x27;ve now had the 9595 for about three months.  Is it the best electric shaver yet?  Most likely.  Can it still be improved?  Yes.  Let me explain.    This shaver gives me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric shaver.  I don&#x27;t expect it to be a razor, but it could still use some improvement.  It is definitely improved upon the 8000 series.  I still have problems with the neck area and I have to go over the same area multiple times (this is where a rotary version helps, I know).  The rest of the face gets a perfect shave.  I have not gotten razor burn or any cuts while using this razor.    The cleaning system has also been improved, but in typical Braun fashion in can be a bit loud.  The noise level has improved over older models though.  The same cleaning solution from the 8000 series works in this system as well.  Now, for $200 I think they could have produced a better feel and finish.  It feels a bit cheap in some areas and after paying that for a shaver I wasn&#x27;t real happy.  It has been holding up very well though, it&#x27;s just that the 8000 series felt more sturdy.  I also don&#x27;t like the white finish on the base, it just seems cheap.  The LCD is great.  It is very responsive and informative.    Overall, I would recommend this shaver.  It does improve upon the 8000 series and other generations.  I am pleased that I upgraded.  If you are willing to spend this much on a shaver you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Bought this razor as a gift for my husband, he loves it says it is the best he&#x27;s ever used.  Loves the automatic cleaning.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best purchases of the year. My brother bought one and convinced me to give it a try too. I was a little skeptical at first, I&#x27;ve grown up with the norelco system (three round blades) and always felt that the bar shaped shavers were somehow inferior. Boy was I wrong. With the norelco (even with new blades) I always had to shave with the grain first and THEN, with gritted teeth, go against the grain. I STILL got reasonably bad razor burn and always felt I must have sensitive skin.     Now, with the braun, I go directly against the grain, right off the bat, and have had NO RAZOR BURN at all for the last couple of weeks. It&#x27;s unbelievable, dramatic improvement.    I would say the only downside is that you have to buy refills for the auto-cleaner. A three pack is $[...] on amazon.com which should last minimum three months so for this level of comfort, I would say $[...] a month is worth it.</li>
    <li> this shaver may be on the expensive side but it works great; and very easy to use &amp; clean.</li>
    <li> This is the second Braun shaver I&#x27;ve had and so far the best.  Simple to use and gives a great shave even in those hard to get at places...</li>
    <li> The Pulsonic is clearly a robust shaver.  I&#x27;ve tried many (all?) other makes and types. For me, blade shaving results in nicks and cuts,and too painful to go against the grain. As a retired older person lectric shaving works for me.  I simply never can&#x27;t get the movie-star smoothness..maybe it&#x27;s the makeup.. from electic or blade.  I keep looking, but in vain, for a real breakthrough in shaver design.  BTW: the cleaner-charger container is rediculous, a waste of money, esp. for refills. What&#x27;s wrong with a faucet rinse?</li>
    <li> First foil type razor I have owned and I will never go back to any other type. Great shave, no irritation. I actually enjoy using it. Love the self cleaning. Well worh the money!</li>
    <li> I have been using electric razors for about 20 years.  I have always stuck with the Norelco razors up until this purchase.  Prior to this I had the top of the line Norelco.  There is no comparison.  This razor blasts through anything even after not shaving for several days.  It is easy to clean, also a step up from the Norelco.  The shave is much closer and it requires fewer passes.  The only negatives to this razor are the noise and the trimmer which is just plain bad.  I keep my Norelco around still just for the trimmer.  The one on this razor is essentially a useless afterthought.  Fortunately, that is not why I bought it.</li>
    <li> THe handiest thing about this shaver is the self cleaning function.   The shave is good,  not quite as good as my old Norelco but still not bad. If you are used to a foil shaver, this thing is great.  Don&#x27;t forget to give it a couple weeks if you are new to foil shavers to let your skin adjust.</li>
    <li> For the last five years I used a Panasonic wet/dry shaver; it was excellent for all but the last year (got noisy and did not shave as well as it did, even with new blades), so I searched for a replacement.  The Braun is a dry shaver but it&#x27;s really very good. It&#x27;s relatively quiet (even though it uses a vibration technology to raise whiskers), shaves close and is very comfortable to use.  I was surprised that I don&#x27;t need any pre-shave to get a good shave and although fast, I don&#x27;t get any razor burn from shaving longer when I want a really close shave.  The pop-up trimmer is the best I have ever used and the cleaning station (which I had doubts about) works very well.  It&#x27;s somewhat expensive but worth the cost.  Whereas I don&#x27;t know how well less expensive razors work, my Braun works well on my heavy beard and boney jawline.</li>
    <li> I switched from a norelco, and i find that the Braun, does not really do much better of a job.  However the replacement blades do cost le3ss.  i am also kind of disappointed that in order to keep the system clean you have to buy the cleaning fluid packs as long s you own the razor.  It is an added expense I really didn&#x27;t need or bargan for.  For the price, i would expect a much better shave and easier maintanance.  most people woudl probably be happier with a less expensive model.  I have used less expensive Braun razors before and foudn they did justas good of a job.</li>
    <li> I have three other Braun shavers. The newest is 360 complete, and the other two are a couple years older. All are self-cleaning. I like to have my primary shaver at home (face and shaved head), and backup shavers in the office. In buying this new shaver, I knew I would be putting my oldest two shavers out to pasture, if this purchase worked out.     This is by far the closest, most comfortable shave I have ever had.    Braun has upgraded the whole system, with the Series 7. Everything is better...ergonomic feel of the shaver in the hand, charger station, and the shave itself.    I know Braun is not cheap. But if you can afford it, buy it. The shave is really that good, compared with all previous Braun models. And when other shavers dream, they are Braun.    Edit: I have (just now) read the reviews back through Aug-2008, and I was surprised to see the complaints. Most of the issues don&#x27;t apply to me. The 9595 shaver and charger are indeed louder than my earlier models, but I don&#x27;t care about that.    Whenever I have bought a new model Braun shaver, I have always thought the shave was an significant improvement over the previous model. Even with a new foil/cutter block on the old model. That is true with the 9595.    My three older Braun shavers still work without any trouble. They are just old technology, by my definition. And these rechargeable batteries don&#x27;t last forever.    I would be surprised, as some have opined, if Braun has taken a nosedive with the 9595, compared with their older models. But if I have trouble with this shaver, I will certainly report here.    Edit1: I just noticed the price of this shaver has dropped to $200. So those of us who bought in the last week or two now realize we should have waited. I always assumed amazon would credit the difference, if a recent purchaser brought it to their attention. A CSR just told me, \\&quot;that is not our policy, sir\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Braun series 790 cc (9595) on November 14th.  Within less than a month, the shaver stopped working.  Blue power light is on, display indicates it has power, but shaver will not turn on at all.  Called Braun; they suggested I return it (at my cost) and they will refund me the purchase price of the shaver.  I told them I wanted a replacement; they don&#x27;t do that, bring to a service center (no locations nearby) or return it for a refund.  Wow, that is some answer.  Do they really think I would then consider purchasing a replacement with their refund or that I would ever again buy a Braun?  For an item that cost over $200 and that I&#x27;ve had for less than a month, this is inexcusable.  Customer service extremely uninterested.</li>
    <li> I was sold on the Hype on this new Braun shaver and bought one thru Amazon. It was rather pricy but looks impressive and the cleaning process is very convenient. But, when it comes to doing the job it doesn&#x27;t compare with the Braun Syncro which is about half the price and does a much better job in less time than the Pulsor. After shaving with the Pulsor I frequently use my older Syncro Braun which is needed if I want a close shave. So I&#x27;m telling myself, just because its new its not better.  So I am about to retire the $200 plus Pulsor and go back to my old Syncro.  So much for my $200 lesson. My advice is buy a Braun Syncro you&#x27;ll be glad you did !!!</li>
    <li> After using many different brands of electric shaver I have concluded that none of them do what they claim - this one included. First of all the price is insane and we were insane to pay it. It does not shave any closer than by old norelco that is still alive and kicking. I have to virtually wear out my skin in order to achieve a smooth shave. The trimmer also stinks. Buy new parts for your old one and save the money.</li>
    <li> Bought this shaver for myself for christmas because of all of the rave reviews about what a close shave it gets.  I am not impressed at all.  This shaver takes longer to shave with than a norelco and I have to use a regular razor to go back over area that this thing didn&#x27;t get.  Very displeased!!!  Would not recommend</li>
    <li> I will add my praise to the chorus of (mostly) ecstatic users.  This shaver is worth every one of the many pennies it costs.      I am a long-term user of Noreleco Rotary electric razors, always buying the top of that line.  Unfortunately, my new Norelco purchases have been coming every two years or so because something about the head mechanism always seems to break in a way which a new comb and cutter set would not fix.  Some plastic part always breaks or cracks, usually allowing the cutter assemblies to fly out of the head.  Once that happens, repair gets more expensive and time consuming and I usually just got a new one.    Even more unfortunately with each new Norelco model the battery seems weaker and the head speed slower, meaning that for best shaves the shaver must be operated in plugged in mode.  The last straw, however, was the relatively poor reviews the new Arcitec razor has been getting from users.  I decided the time had come for something different.    I did hesitate, however, having previously owned a Braun and having been underwhelmed with its heavy feel, high noise level, and huge amount of vibration.  However, given the hundreds of very positive reviews here for this latest-and-greatest model, I decided to take the plunge.    From the very first shave, I knew I would not be going back to the Norelcos.  Yes, the Braun still vibrates my hand and face more than the Norelco and is somewhat noisier.  However, the vibration now feels more like a massage and the noise was not so loud that I didn&#x27;t accommodate to it within a couple of shaves.    But the speed of the shave, the closeness of the shave, and the lack of skin irritation during and after the shave was what immediately won me over.  These are all quite superior to anything any top-of-the-line Norelco ever gave me, and they were the best electric shavers I&#x27;d ever used before.  With this Braun, I can rub may face any way I like after a shave and not feel any residual stubble.  That just wasn&#x27;t possible with any other electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned before.  There is no facial redness following the shave, and I can wash my face with soap immediately after the shave without any irritation from the soap.    Now we&#x27;ll see how long it lasts.  I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple of months.  It looks sturdy, with far fewer thin plastic parts than a Norelco, so I have high hopes.    The cleaning vat works as advertised, but I seem to get just as good if not better results in terms of speed, comfort, and closeness by taking the razor head off after each shave and rinsing the top of the razor and the head in a vigorous stream of very warm tap water, patting dry, air drying for awhile and then reassembling.  That process surely is quicker than using the machine.  I do smear a drop of the Braun oil across the heads once a week as recommended in the instructions if you are not constantly using the cleaning vat, which has both alcohol and an oil in the cleaning solution.</li>
    <li> Item................Braun Series7-790cc(9595)Pulsonic Shaver  [...]  I have not used this item because the shaver would not allow itself to be seated in the charger. This is taking longer than anticipated because I am visually impaired.  curtis Harper</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd Braun Shaver that I&#x27;ve owned. With each purchase, I&#x27;ve upgraded and noticed a better, closer shave. Well, this IS the ultimate shaving experience with an electric shaver. Even though it appears a bit pricey, after one use you&#x27;ll see why. I&#x27;d highly recommend this shaver to anyone.</li>
    <li> Would use this seller again.  Great experience.  The item is great as well!</li>
    <li> I concur with many of the reviews that say this shaver does not provide a close shave. It is very expensive, but does seem very well made. I will only use it for travel and will rely on a blade and shaving cream when at home.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco shavers for the past 30 years (the top of the line).  When my shaver started going out I was torn whether or not to buy another Norelco or the Braun 790.  I decide on the Braun and I love the very close shaves (and so does my wife) and the very easy cleaning.  I would highly recommend this shaver to anyone.  My wife bought and sent all three of her boys one about a month after I bought mine.  We are happy campers.</li>
    <li> My previous razor was a braun (8595?) so I was excited to see an \\&quot;upgraded\\&quot; razor from Braun come out.  Price was steep  but found a good deal on Amazon.  Initial response was lukewarm because it felt \\&quot;less durable\\&quot; then my previous razor. . . but performance is excellent.  Definitely gives a real close shave without the skit irritation / hassle of using a razor/foam.  Only time will tell if the construction of this razor will hold up.  Still have my \\&quot;older\\&quot; braun but don&#x27;t plan to use it unless absolutely necessary!!</li>
    <li> All I can say is if you want an electric shaver that gives a nearly perfect shave, then this is it!</li>
    <li> I have now used all types of razors.  The closest shave ever comes from a true razor blade.  However; I have sensitive skin that irritates easily.  The neck bumps are horrible and unsightly.  I most recently replaced a rotory type electric razor due to the fact that when they hit marble tile from six feet plus...they break.  I paid approximately 80.00 dollars for my old electric and was not looking forward to spending 200.00 on a new one.  After getting this new gadget home and using it, I have to say that I am impressed.  The shave is so close I have to tell myself I did not use a razor blade.  The sides of my face and jaw are very very smooth.  My neck is a little tougher to shave and takes some working and streching but still comes clean.  I am able to shave 3 or 4 days then have to clean.  I have been using this razor for a couple of months and the indicator still shows full for the cleaning solution.  I don&#x27;t know why so many people complained about having to buy the liquid and replacement razor heads.  If you use a Mach however many Turbo razor, you will spend a boat load of money on new razors every year.  They are not cheap even if you buy them in bulk.  Bottom line.  This razor rocks and is pretty quiet too.  The only complaint I have is the monsterous power cord.  They should make it at a right angle so it does not stick out 3 to 4 inches from the wall.  Shop around on Amazon to find the best deal for this razor.  My wife was able to score mine for under 200.00 dollars.  If you are on the fence...jump off and buy this razor.</li>
    <li> Did much research for this one.  My husband has very sensitive skin and loves this shaver.  No irriation..great self-cleaning function and great charging.</li>
    <li> After many years of blade shaving, I got flat our tired of it - the process and admin of it - especially the expensive blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A number of years ago I tried to switch to an electric shaver, but was very unhappy with the burning feel of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I read through all the reviews here, I learned that the burning pain was due to the \\&quot;lift and cut approach\\&quot; of the rotary shaver I purchased, and that the foil shavers do not have the same problem.  I decided it was time to give a Braun a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I was unsure about a cleaning system ( gimmick? Just other stuff to refill?), I decide for the money I was about to spend, I might as well spend a bit more and go for it.  I am really glad that I did. NO REGRETS.  The cleaning system works very well: keeping shaver clean and nicely/lightly scented with lemon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know nothing of comparision by experience with other foil electric shavers, so I can only help others by reporting that I am a 5 Star satified user and swticher to my Braun.  If you are looking to switch from blade to shaver, this is safe and great way to go.  I am done with blades.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST MONEY I HAVE EVER SPENT.  MY HUSBAND IS BLIND AND WAS HAVING A TERRIABLE TIME SHAVING.  WITH THE ELECTRIC RAZOR IT HAS MADE LIFE A LOT BETTER FOR HIM.  I WOULD HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS RAZOR.    SHIRLEY</li>
    <li> This is my third Braun shaver and by far the best one yet. Much less irritation and closer shave than other electrics that I have used. Fits well in hand when in use. Rubber grip gives a good firm grasp on shaver. LCD is very cool. It&#x27;s expensive but worth it! Until something better comes along this is the best there is.</li>
    <li> I just upgraded from the 8995 to the 9595 and in a word it&#x27;s fabulous! I converted from Norelco rotary razors about a year ago to Braun and at the time I was very impressed with the build quality and how close the shave was compared to the Norelco. For the record I had the top of the line Norelco 9190XL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Braun redesigned their flagship razor they started with a clean slate. This isn&#x27;t a simple upgrade of the 8995, it goes beyond that. They reduced the size of the overall unit making it slimmer and more comfortable to hold. The head now has a greater range of pivoting and the cutters now float individually. Overall it allows the shaver to more closely follow the contours of your face while maintaining contact with the skin it is trying to shave. Also this model doesn&#x27;t seem to drop or shed the cut stubble all over the counter top as easily as the old model. The way the new screen and blades are designed they seem to trap and hold the cut hair in the head until it&#x27;s time to be cleaned. The old model would dust my counter top with cut stubble as if I were using a pepper shaker on my counter top. Two thumbs up for the new head design. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new Pulsonic motor is in my opinion much quieter than the model it replaces. The sonic pulses are supposed to vibrate the head causing the screen to catch more hair with less passes over the same spot. The result is truly outstanding! I have a patch of hair just over my adams apple that I have to really spend a lot of time trying to shave by stretching the skin . The new razor nearly eliminates all the work and makes shaving more comfortable and FASTER than ever before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LCD display is smaller than the outgoing model but it displays the same amount of information. It tells me the remaining charge and the current hygiene state of the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clean &amp; Renew base station has also been redesigned. It is now an off white color and matches my tile counter top. Also the start button has been redesigned and it no longer locks the razor in place while it&#x27;s cleaning. The instructions state that the Clean &amp; Renew station will \\&quot;dry \\&quot; the razor using heat. I&#x27;m not sure if the old model did this or not but it is a welcome feature nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this razor to anyone looking to buy an electric razor. It&#x27;s quiet, fast and close shaves are as good as you&#x27;re going to get. The build quality is top notch and the company stands behind their products.

    <li> like most men over the years I have had almost every brand of razor. always promised the closest shave ever and of course it never was.until now. this new razor by braun is light years ahead of any other brand.it&#x27;s not cheap but what a pleasure to shave without pull or irritation. pre-shave is uneccassary.It is fairly quiet. it cuts the hairs on your face effortlessly and when you splash on after shave there is no burning sensation because there is no irritation. It shaves every part of  your face equally well and there simply is no pier for closeness. if it is not as close as a blade the difference is negligible. you won&#x27;t regret getting this razor.</li>
    <li> After shaving with a Mach3 for the past 8 years (with a brief electric shaving trial in between) I decided to switch over to the dark side.  I was not disappointed!      After unpacking the beautifully packed box, I plugged in the base station and put the shaver in it.  The shaver fits snugly and the lights on the base station light up to confirm that the shaver is being charged.  It was clean since it had never been used so I turned it on and went to work on three day old stubble.  One minute later, my face was completely smooth and -- to my surprise -- not irritated.  The shave was extremely close, though maybe just barely less close than a blade.  Still, I ran my hand down my cheek and there was absolutely no resistance.      While it wasn&#x27;t my main reason for buying the Pulsonic, the base station is amazing.  After shaving, I replaced the shaver in the base station and pressed the standard clean button.  It sucked up some liquid, ran it through, and then dried the shaver off for a while.  I love anything that cleans itself!    The main reason I got the Braun Pulsonic is because my beard doesn&#x27;t grow quickly enough to allow me to shave daily with blade without irritating my skin.  The Braun fixed my problem there.  My only complaint, a very small one, is that the base station feels a little flimsy.  It doesn&#x27;t seal completely at the bottom with or without a cleaning cartridge in.  However, the gap is about 2 millimeters and does not effect the cleaning or anything at all really so I&#x27;ll just forget about it.  In fact it&#x27;s not even visible unless you duck down and stare on eye level.    Overall an amazing product: the shaver is clearly well made and it does a superb job.</li>
    <li> This shaver is by far the best electric shaver ever made.  I&#x27;ve tried all different types of shavers from all the big name manufacturers, and this shaver is the best!!!!  Super fast shave and super smooth shave.  It is worth every penny of the $249 that I paid for it.  You&#x27;ll love it!!</li>
    <li> I used the latest Braun (Pulsonic 9595) for 3 months and have been a Braun fan for 10 years.  After using the Norelco arcitec 1090 for 2 months I can say it gives me a closer shave than the Braun, both in light touch-up and heavy-pressure use.  The Norelco is more fun to use and less expensive to clean.  Just run it in a small cup of alcohol every other week, and touchup with glycerin.</li>
    <li> At first I thought it was too expensive for an electric shaver, but I was tired of the burning and stubble left behind from other electric shavers that I decided it was time to spend the extra money and see if it was worth it, was it ever, this shaver is the best electric shaver I have ever used.  I would go weeks with just trimming the hair back to avoid fully shaving, razors were getting so expensive and you have to throw them away after 1 or 2 shaves.  I recommend this shaver to everyone and believe me when I say it is well worth the money, I would have paid more now that I know how nice it really is.  The shaver stays very cool throughout the shave and once you know how to get the best results the shave goes even quicker, one of the best things about it is cleaning, you don&#x27;t have to do anything except push a button.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a Norelco shaver for years and then topped the shave off with a blade to ensure a close shave. I have used this razor a few times in the last couple of days and do not need to top it off with a blade. It gives an extremely close shave. I also like the ability to self clean as I believe it will make the shaving head last longer and be more hygienic in the process. It is a bit pricey but so are the blades I have been buying. I highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> My husband has used a Braun shaver like forever and he says that this is the best one yet.</li>
    <li> The razor gives a great shave.  I especially like the self cleaning feature.  Each use is just as good as the first. The blades are clean, fresh and sharp after each use.  The only regret is that there is no blade for trimming sideburns or mustaches.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s the word to describe this razor.I have always looked to braun for the cutting edge in technology and this time they out did themselves.I have been shaving with an electric shaver for many years and have tried all types and brands truthfully this product is in a class by itself.The results the difference in closeness between the pulsonic and a blade shave is negligible.You can&#x27;t even feel it when you shave it glides over your face it&#x27;s really quite remarkable you have to experience it for yourself you won&#x27;t beleive it either.Tho other negative comments about noise are greatly exagerated I have owned many other braun razors and this is no louder than the others if anything it might be slightly quiter. Build quality is excellent as well as ergonomics cleaner works flawlessly shave is unequalled in the industry I rarely get excited about a new product I beleive this product will be the standard for many years to come if you want a great piece of art get a norelco arcitec if you want a blade close shave with no missed spots ther is only one choice it&#x27;s the Pulsonic by Braun.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had. Very smooth shave. My 5 o&#x27;clock shadow is equivalent to the best shave I could get with a Norelco.</li>
    <li> I have owned two Braun electric shavers before this (the 7000 series and then the 8000 series). I just replaced the blades/foil on my 8595 (every 9 months, it is just too worn by then) and the new one was not working well at all. They have changed to the \\&quot;360 complete\\&quot; heads (blue strip with different sized holes), and that did not work well for me on the 8595. So, I was wary of getting this Pulsonic since it uses the same new head.   I bought it anyway after seeing the reviews.  I am very impressed and amazed. Where I used to have to take 10-20 passes over the same place to get reasonable smoothness, this new one was smoother after just 2 passes. It shaved the hairs at my Adams apple extremely well, where the other ones never did (they curl this way and that). Since the 8595 had brand new blades/foil, it has to be the new shaver that made the difference.  Like others, I am 1st to state that electric shavers will never shave as smooth as a multi-blade razor, but this comes closer than any electric I have had before. It also seems to avoid heat buildup on the head.  Note that you really should only shave before a shower and at least 15 minutes after you wake up - your skin is puffy when you 1st awake, and your hair and skin absorb a lot of water when you shower (good for a razor but bad for an electric; the razor does well because wet and puffed up skin is less likely to get snagged/cut and wet hair catches the 1st blade better, allowing it to be pulled out more).  One good thing about the 9595 is that it has a narrower body (normal sized head) and is much easier to hold.</li>
    <li> My husband saw this advertised on TV and wanted to try it, so we stepped up to make the purchase.  He is finally satisfied with a razor.  HE LOVES IT!  No more complaining about his razor&#x27;s performance or the heads falling off.  He&#x27;s a Braun Pulsonic believer!</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver from Amazon in November, 2009. Today it died.  When I turn it on, the switch light is on, but the shaver doesn&#x27;t come on.  I bought it because I saw so many positive reviews here! It does give a decent shave (except under my chin), but it makes a big mess with hairs everywhere.  have to shave above the sink all the time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit (June 28, 2013): I fixed it for free more than two years ago because the warranty was still valid. Today it finally gave up. It makes noises, but it doesn&#x27;t shave.. the side cutter stops working totally..  I don&#x27;t know how much it costs to fix it. Maybe I need change to another brand.  Braun no more.</li>
    <li> If your looking for a serious electronic shaver, not one for occasional use, this is the one to get.  If you are looking for something just for travel or sparse use, look at some cheaper options.    I have been a long time Norelco user, but my last unit got old, and it was time to upgrade.  I decided to go with this shaver because of the positive reviews, and they have proved to be true.      This shaver performs very well.  The cleaning system is really great, no more manual cleaning.  Also it delivers a clean and close shave.  Be wary though, getting a decent shave required more time than using my previous Norelco, but the results were better.  So I guess this is a good trade off.    Pros: Close, and clean shave.  Cleaning system works perfectly.  The base unit won&#x27;t over charge the shaver, unlike a Norelco.  So this means the battery quality will not diminish over time.      Cons: Can&#x27;t get good results while trying to pull off a &#x27;quick shave&#x27;, so expect to take that extra 2 - 3 mins.  Price is not a con, since it is worth it for the overall package that you get.</li>
    <li> Braun Pulsonic System 9595 with LCD Screen  I have been using Braun electric shavers since I was in the army in Germany in 1951 and was always satisfied. Over these many years I&#x27;ve tried other shavers but always went back to a Braun. A few weeks ago I purchased the Model 9595 and WOW!! The best yet! It gives a close shave and the self cleaning feature makes shaving a breese.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS SHAVER FOR MY SON AND HE LOVES IT . HE SAYS IT IS THE CLOSEST SHAVE EVER. HE ALSO SAID THIS DOES NOT IRRITATE HIS FACE LIKE THE OTHER RAZORS HAVE. THE CLEANING FEATURE IS GREAT. THE PRICE WAS EXCELLENT IN MY OPINION.</li>
    <li> EDIT&lt;br /&gt;I originally gave this razor 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;Review added July 11, 2008&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1.  I was very impressed with the closeness of the shave, better than Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;2.  I could shave in half the time than before. A real plus.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Cleaning was more convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I scored the shaver on closeness and speed, it would get 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1.  If I let my beard grow more than a couple of days, the Braun can&#x27;t cut longer whiskers. Have to trim using my wife&#x27;s razor.&lt;br /&gt;2.  The cleaning system is not as thorough as I first reported. Getting the head clean is a real chore as it can&#x27;t be disassembled. The cleaning system still leaves every crick &amp; cranny full of soggy whisker powder. Washing with hot water and even 409 can&#x27;t dislodge the stuff. The cleaning cartridges last about 2 months and cost $11 for two. And yes, I have used them as they reportedly have a lubricant, which seems justified. That&#x27;s about $30/year.&lt;br /&gt;3.  The Foil broke after 8 months! Braun states the foil and cutter cassette should be good for about 18 months. The break was inside the cassette not the shaving surface. I&#x27;m not a rambunctious shaver.&lt;br /&gt;4.  The original cost plus cleaner divided by 8 (months) is about $30 a month so far!!  This is damned costly shaving and I still have to buy a foil/cutter cassette to keep using the pulsonic!&lt;br /&gt;5.  Replacing the cassette is $37 through Amazon, $40+ locally if you can find one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had I known how expensive this shaver would be to use and maintain, I would have stuck with the Norelco, regardless how close and fast the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for 25 years and never really had an issue with them.  I had read somewhere that foil shavers irritate some people.  Razor blade shavers leave my face a bloody mess no matter how careful I am.  So, I just stuck with Norelco as they did an adequate job.  Shaving is something I have to do, not want to do.  An autopilot, ho hum, every morning, chore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when the batteries started dying on my last Norelco after only 5 years, the other models have lasted much longer, I decided to try something else.  My sons have been telling me for years how much they liked the Braun and they didn&#x27;t find them irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I started looking at Braun, I discovered the Pulsonic uses the same technology as the Sonicare toothbrush, which I like.  The ratings looked good but yikes, the cost!  I debated with myself about this a couple of days then decided, hey, Christmas was right around the corner, and I have been a good boy, plus Amazon would keep me out of the Christmas crowds and shipping was free.  My time has to be worth something, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less than a week later, I shaved one side of my face with the Norelco (the blades are only a couple of months old) and the other with the Pulsonic and asked my wife which side was smoother.  She chose the Pulsonic side, which didn&#x27;t surprise me because it felt much closer to me also.  I&#x27;ve also been pleasantly surprised to find shaving doesn&#x27;t take as long as it did with the Norelco!  After three weeks, I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  The Pulsonic shaves much closer than the Norelco AND shaves faster.  I can&#x27;t speak for other Braun models, but I would certainly recommend the Pulsonic.  OK, maybe I&#x27;m still trying to justify the cost, but cleaning is thorough and couldn&#x27;t be more easy; something I often neglected with the Norelco.</li>
    <li> One of the closest shaves ever, with an electric razor! The shaver is a breeze to charge and clean. I highly recommend this shaver! Lu</li>
    <li> I bought my husband the Braun Pulsonic System shaver for Christmas.  He is very particular about shaving.  He has used it every day since Christmas Day and he loves it.  He gets a clean smooth shave every time with no razor bumps!  It is very attatractive and the automatic cleaning mechanism is awesome!</li>
    <li> My new Braun Pulsonic arrived 2 days after Christmas in a tribute to gross over-packaging--sort of a seeming excuse for the higher price. The razor is impressive-looking with a solid feel, shaves as well as my old (worn out)Norelco, then cleans itself in the razor stand. What else can you ask for?</li>
    <li> I purchased the Braun Pulsonic System 9595 with the LCD Screen for my husband for the holidays.    My husband is very happy with the the shaver because it gives a great, close shave and has a cleaning system to keep the shaver working at its best.    If you are traveling by air, the cleaning system cannot be taken on the plane because of the chemicals used in the cleaning/charging base.  The shaver can be plugged into the wall for charging and it can be cleaned by rinsing under water during this time.</li>
    <li> Powerful, easy to hold. Saves time and gives a great shave. If the cleaning system does not tend to be a pain (to early to tell), this is a great shaving system. The power and the speed save time and time is money. Pays for itself in about 6 months if you make 12.00 per hour. If you make 100.00 per hour, it pays for itself in 6 weeks. A Bargain!</li>
    <li> I am VERY impressed by this. It was a bit expensive but it was worth it to me. I upgraded from an old norelco rotary/circular wet/gel shaver that just didnt do a great job. I was worried my skin would like like a dry shaver but amazingly it works great and doesnt bother my skin!!!</li>
    <li> Braun 9595 Shaver does what the ad says it will. It takes a few days for your face to adjust. The shave is close and can be acomplished quickly. The cleaning process(which requires you to purchase cleaning solution) does an excellent job of cleaning the shaver, and giving the shaver a clean and refreshing scent.    The price is more than most shavers, but BRAUN is known for building a quality product, and this is just one of many. At times, one pays more for quality.    I have used Norelco and Remington shavers, and recommend this model of Braun as a replacement. I am far from being disappointed.</li>
    <li> Quite simply, this is the first electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned that actually shaves as close or closer than a disposable and is an actual pleasure to use.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews, I&#x27;ve had 4 or 5 electric razors over the years, and I was ready to pay for the best razor out there. This isn&#x27;t it. I have an ultrasonic toothbrush and I really liked it. That&#x27;s why I tried this out.     It still takes several passes to catch hairs, no different than my cheap electric razor and maybe not any better at all.     The clipper on the side is at a 90 degree angle, meaning it&#x27;s hard to trim eyebrows or beards with it, or get under hairs that the razor misses.    The LCD is nice for showing the battery level, but the hygiene one is B.S. It just goes by the run time. I&#x27;m sure they make money on the refills and that&#x27;s why it goes down so fast. I just rinse it with water and do the auto clean in the base once a week or so.    I really wanted to like this thing, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have used Braun shavers as my sole form of shaving for 20 odd years. This is without doubt the best shaver I have ever used. I purchased it through Amazon a few months ago as it wasn&#x27;t available in Australia  (amazingly it still isn&#x27;t) and after about two weeks of getting use to it, I am a convert. The shave is as quick and smooth as you would ever want and best of all it picks up those difficult hairs under your chin with ease. As for the rest of my face, it feels as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom (excuse the pun) after a couple of minutes. This is something no previous electric shaver I have used could achieve. The cleaning system is excellent and the carry case is a welcome addition for travelling. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a plastic protector for the head. I am forced to either put the shaver in the carry case or have it upside down in the cleaner when I&#x27;m not using it. It&#x27;s a pity Braun ditched the plastic head protector. That aside, overall the closest shave you will get to a hand razor without all the headaches associated with manual shavers.(cutting yourself, time it takes, replacing blades/shaving cream etc) My only other small gripe is that I was charged US$75 in P&amp;H to ship the shaver to Australia. It cost the seller US $10 as the stamps on the postage indicated - a tidy profit! My one tip would be to use a pre-shaver lotion prior to shaving, it makes the shave even closer and reduces the risk of inflammation that some people get with shaving.</li>
    <li> I tried electric shavers about 8 years ago and didn&#x27;t like them.  Since that time I have suffered shaving rash and shaving bumps on my neck from using conventional safty razors.    My girlfriend gave me this shaver for my birthday and it rocks.  I now shave comfortably everyday, without any bleeding, bumps or rashes.  It&#x27;s light weight, easy to clean (automatic mostly) and it actually cuts the hair (doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s ripping them out of my face).    This razor is worth the price.  Buy this razor and don&#x27;t accept cheap knock offs!</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews here and on other sites prior to purchasing this product, and I have to say, it is very good.  However, it is not as perfect as I thought it would be.  2 things that I think were major Cons:  It misses its fair share of hair, and no matter how many times I go over a certain spot, the \\&quot;hair comb\\&quot; won&#x27;t pick up some hairs.  The other thing is that unless you shave on a daily basis, you have to pre-trim (of course this depends on how fast your beard grows).  Advantages:  If you have sensitive skin like I do, this electric is definitely for you--it is great for my sensitive skin, even if you don&#x27;t use a pre-shave balm/lotion (has to be dry before you shave).  It you don&#x27;t have difficult hairs, this electric is awesome.  Just  know this, it gets close, but not as close as an actual razor.  Overall, its very good, and better than anything else I have tried.</li>
    <li> my husband loves this so much.  it cleans its self after every use, so my husband&#x27;s skin doesn&#x27;t break out at all now.  fantastic!</li>
    <li> I hate shaving with a blade and would pay a lot for an electric razor that would give as close of a shave.  Unfortunately, the Braun 9595, while certainly a good electric razor, doesn&#x27;t match the closeness of a blade.  With my previous electric razor, I would use it and then shave with a blade for maximum closeness, which I was hoping to avoid with this one.  Between the over $200 price of the blade on top of buying the monthly cleaning cartridges, it&#x27;s just not worth it.</li>
    <li> i had a philips norelco model was pretty good, but no doubt this is a bit cleaner shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned several Braun razors, but this one is definitely the best shave.  It&#x27;s my favorite razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> I had an electric shaver years ago and it was one of those three head types.  I was never satisfied with the shave so I eventually went back to a razor.  When I bought this shaver, I was hoping that technology had improved as well as that this was a quality shaver.    Both I think are true.  The shaver works great with very few exceptions.  I find the shaver gives a very close shave on all parts of my face.  The technology doesn&#x27;t make it possible to simply swipe the shaver over a check and that&#x27;s it; you have to pass the saver a number of times for a really close shave.      A razor gets to the point quicker but also nicks and scrapes a WHOLE lot more.    I have a bit of trouble getting a close shave on the part of my neck just below the jawbone.  I guess this is because that&#x27;s a fleshy part of anyone&#x27;s neck and skin gives too much, but you learn how to adjust your pressure and passes.      The device can&#x27;t get that spot close to your nose.  It&#x27;s just logical.  a razor&#x27;s cross section is like a 1/4 inch where the electric razor head is  more than an inch.  So, for those who have a whisker or two nearer the nose, you may have to still cut that with a razor if yo want to get all the nasty little beggars.    The razor does not provide a way to make that clear straight cut at the end of sideburns either.  So every once in awhile i cut that with a razor too.    Over all I am pleased.  The readout showing shaver state tells you when it needs to be cleaned.  If I follow the little dial readout exactly, I get three shaves before it tells me the razor needs to be cleaned.  I usually go four or five before cleaning.  It doesn;t seem to make a big difference to subsequent shaves.    The cleaning process is fully automated so you just push the button and walk away.    I bought my son a Panasonic that uses water as the solvent for cleaning.  The Braun requires a cartridge with it&#x27;s own solution formula.  The cartridges last a long time so it isn&#x27;t a bother to me but my son seems to like the Panasonic just fine so there is an alternative if you don&#x27;t want to buy special cleaner cartridges.    The battery holds a pretty substantial charge and I have no problem taking it on a week-long business trip with no worry that I need to charge it while on travel.</li>
    <li> I like the self-cleaning &amp; charging although I do pop off the head and tap out the loose stuff before I run it through the auto cleaner.  It gives a good shave and holds a charge well when I take it out of town for a couple of days w/o the charger.  It works really great on all my camping trips since it never leaves my truck (Who shaves on a camping trip?) but it does keeps my wife&#x27;s hope up...    Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> This is a really good razor with a very fine cleaning system. The initial cost is high but worth it. The cost would be prohibitive if you bought replacement cleaning cartriges every month but the cartriges can be refilled with rubbing alcohol containing oil of wintergreen with good results.</li>
    <li> Seriously this is the best shaver of ALL TIME, I own the old Braun 7000 and the head broke after a few years so I was not sure about getting another Braun but IT IS AWESOME.   The best, fastest, closest shave ever for me and I chew up and spit out razors.</li>
    <li> As an amazon prime customer who makes purchases weekly I felt compelled to write this as my first ever product review / comparison.    The primary reason for my purchase of the Braun 9595 was that I decided to start shaving my head. In the past I have never had success with any razor for facial shaving. At least of the many electric razors that I have tried in the past never got all the hair and made me feel as if I still needed to go over it with a regular razor to get everything.    This 9595 has had rave reviews and is highly rated so I purchased it and have used it for 4 months.    After using the razor for about a month it was doing a better job than any electric razor that I had ever used.  I was totally impressed based on that comparison.  However for my face I would still feel that I would need to go over it with a regular razor to get the stuff that the braun could not.  Also after having shaved my head now for several months it seemed like it would take a long time for the braun 9595 to get everything. In fact my head and face started feeling sensitive because I was having to vigorously go over all areas again and again.  So this got me thinking that I would get another electric razor as a supplement that I could use while in the shower.  I figured between the two of them I could maintain my head and face between the mirror and the shower.  So after much research I landed on the Panasonic ES8243.  It was half the price of the braun and I figured well how bad could it be as a supplement and backup to the braun.    Now having used the Panasonic for a month all I can say is wow!  It is not my supplement it is the only one that i want to use.  It is better than the braun in every way!    Compared side by side it is totally obvious.    The Panasonic gets MUCH closer in far less time and most is done with one pass.  It can be used wet or dry in the shower and does equally well in both situations.  I can shave with the braun and then follow up with the Panasonicand easily see how much the braun missed.  The truth is these two razors are not even close to being in the same league.    I still have both but have no idea where the braun even fits into my shaving any longer.  I did not expect this to be the case.</li>
    <li> I have ordered many razors but this one will fill the void that is my shaving cabinet.  Never have I loved a razor so much!!</li>
    <li> First electric shaver ever. Researched and went for the best out there according to the critics. Paid good price for new technology and hoped for the best. My beard is average? One thing for sure If I let a day go by it becomes a pain in the arse. Used fussion blades and gillette shaving cream and after several minutes and if the blades are relatively new I would end up, with what is known, as a close shave. Hard to beat and regretfully the Braun Series 7- 790cc (9595) Pulsonic Shaver does not come even as close or better still, is unable to perform as well. Regardless of how many approaches to shaving with this machine I use I do not end up with a smooth surface. Does not conquer basically anything (neck, upper lip, sides of face) but it does clean up the appearance and for that reason I have to give it 4 Stars. Less hassle than pulling the old razor and shaving but not the same results. Like the cleaning unit that is included for it does clean well the shaver. Yes, a little steep priced the liquid but, hey, when you spend over $200 for a shaver you are supposedly able and willing to dish out for the additional convenience and comfort. Every time I finish shaving and I check for smoothness I find there is none, it is not a perfect shave but it does shave enough where for that day you can put a check-mark on the calendar. Sorry I bought it? No. As good as the real deal? No. But I knew that that the razor blade shave is hard to beat. 4 Stars for offering a decent alternative.</li>
    <li> This razor WILL save you BIG MONEY if you&#x27;re currently using a manual blade system like the Gillette Fusion or Mach-3.    Manual replacement blades, which cost big money, definitely last very little time before they become dull. I got this Braun razor about a year ago for $199.99 and it came with a $50.00 Amazon gift certificate. So I got an amazing razor, the best they make for $150.00 since I&#x27;m def going to be using the gift certificates for stuff I need at the already lowest price. I no longer have to buy a new pack of blades every 4 weeks (only have to replace the blade set once a year now for $25.00) and no shave cream ever (have to buy cleaning and lubrication packs though) and I never get irritated skin anymore.    So now I&#x27;ve spent $150.00 + $25.00 + $50.00 &#x3D; $225.00 for the first year and a half I&#x27;ve used this razor instead of $25.00 x 18 months (what I had been paying every 4 weeks for blades) + $100.00 (18 months of shave cream) + $15 for stupid razor handle-thing&#x3D; $565.00    The manual blade system cost me roughly 2.5 times what I now pay, and as a plus I no longer get irritated skin ever.</li>
    <li> This is the 4th electric shaver I have purchased and the 2nd Braun.  Overall I am very pleased with the performance of this shaver.     Pros:    * Well balanced feel and size.  * Rubberized grip keeps shaver from slipping in to the sink!  * Easy to ready LCD display lets you know when to charge and clean.  * Less irriatating on skin, could just be me?  * Extremely close shave, better than any other shaver I have owned.  * Can be cleaned by rinsing in water or using the cleaning solution.    Cons:    * Very expensive</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the shaver for 6 weeks and I love the shave. This morning I pushed the button and nothing. Fully charged and cleaned but it won&#x27;t run. We&#x27;ll see how the repair/replacement goes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UODATE IT STATED WORKING AND HAS PROVIDED A GREAT SHAVE SINCE THEN.  Did not have to replace. it has worked perfectly for the last four (4) years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for about 2 months now.  It is a very good shaver (as it should be for the price), but it is not perfect, nor is it as close as a blade.  I have primarily used a combination of electric foil shavers and straight blade razors (Gillette Mach 3 Turbo) my whole life.  I have a moderately tough/thick beard and the rotary shavers that I&#x27;ve tried do not operate at a high enough RPM, resulting in the hair being pulled out rather than cut (ouch).  Like most people, the toughest area for me to shave closely is around my neck.  This shaver certainly doesn&#x27;t do any worse than any other electric I&#x27;ve ever used, but still leaves some rough areas there.  On my face itself, the Braun 790cc does a pretty good job of shaving, although it seems to have a little trouble leaving super smooth results in my mustache area, even when I use the locking feature on the shaver&#x27;s head.  I will say that this is by far the most comfortable foil shaver I have ever used and does not leave my skin feeling raw and irritated like some previous shavers have done.  In addition to using it to shave my face, I also have a shaved head and use this razor on a daily basis for that purpose as well.  This, by far, gives me the best and closest shave on my head of any electric I&#x27;ve ever used and I would highly recommend it for anyone who is thinking of using it for that purpose as well.  Overall, this is a very good shaver and I would definitely recommend it, but it still won&#x27;t give you a shave that is as close as you can get from a blade (nor will any electric that I&#x27;ve ever used).  If you buy this shaver, I would definitely recommend using the cleaning station and buying the cleaning solution refill cartridges.  I&#x27;m always skeptical of products that require \\&quot;add-on&#x27;s\\&quot; after you buy the main product, but in this case, using the cleaning station on a regular basis definitely helps to give you a better shave, rather than just cleaning the razor with water all the time.  The cleaning solution has lubricants in it that help the razor to give you a smoother, more comfortable shave.  Although Braun recommends using the cleaning station daily, I&#x27;ve found that using it twice a week seems to be sufficient.  I clean my razor daily with just water and use the cleaning station once every 3 or 4 days.  That way, I can get at least a couple months out of each cleaning cartridge and I still get a good shave.</li>
    <li> One thing electric shavers get is a bad rap on and around the neck. Well this one does take a little time to and effort to clean up the neck, but the time is well worth since there is no burn. I would say this is the best electric shaver on the market since I have tried the Panasonic 1050x \\&quot;Horrible Shaver\\&quot;. Get this one it is a Slam Dunk.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have given my husband a gift for Christmas that he really, really, really likes.  We have been married 46 yrs and at long last this was the best gift so far.  Thank you and will highly recomend this shaver to everyone.  Sure took me a long time to get this gift giving right.  Also we gave  our daughter the Kindle for Christmas.  She travels for her company and is a avide book reader.  This also was perfect.  Thank you Amazon for a great Christmas.</li>
    <li> It certainly doesn&#x27;t give you as close of a shave as the old fashion shaving cream and shaver, but it does a good job. If you shave often (don&#x27;t let it get too long) it doesn&#x27;t scratch or pull at all, also if you go over one area a couple times you can get a close enough shave. The cleaner cleans it really well, just not sure how much it will add up to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also haven&#x27;t used it for a long while so I am carious to see how long the blades work as those are pretty pricy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to get an electric shaver I would recommend it, also I would recommend trying an electric shaver cause so far I do like it over shaving cream and all that jazz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also as one last note it goes over the groves just as well a standard shaver, but thing long hairs more near the neck it doesn&#x27;t do as well. I have pretty bony jaw and it works well. Also the price and shipping time was really good.</li>
    <li> This is a quality razor and as close as it gets to a standard razor and shave cream.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he really enjoys it. He said it was the best present I ever bought.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this is THE BEST SHAVER I HAVE EVER USED!!. I have NO Not any IRRITATION after shaving. I use Williams Lectric Shave-Pre-shave before I shave and Nivea after shave replenishing balm after I shave and my face feels and looks great.</li>
    <li> No complaints well worth the money best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used and the only electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever liked and I&#x27;ve tried my fair share</li>
    <li> I received this shaver for Christmas &#x27;08 to my surprise given the somewhat hefty price tag.  I have been using it for about a month now and could not be happier with it.  As an african american I do not use blades to shave as I am prone to razor bumps so I have definitely tried my fair share of electric razors.  The Pulsonic is the closest shave I have ever received with an electric razor and requires far fewer strokes than most.    The only negative I could say about the shaver is the cleaning system can be considered loud and time consuming.  Takes about half an hour to fully clean itself but of course you clean it after you&#x27;ve shaven, not like you&#x27;re waiting around for it to finish cleaning.    Trust me, you won&#x27;t be dissapointed!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not much of an electric razer fan. I owned a Philips 3 head shaver prior to this one and was never happy with it. Before that I had a beard. This one I love! I get a great shave and the self cleaning feature is fantastic.</li>
    <li> This is one great shaver. Braun really makes a good reliable product and I will never use any other brand.  This model is a little louder than eariler braun shavers but it makes up for it with better shave. I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> Best electric Shaver I have ever used! Use to use 4 blade razor and but this electric shaver shaves just as close. Great Product</li>
    <li> I came from using a rotary electric razor, so I wasn&#x27;t sure how this would work. My beard adjusted within a few uses, and now I get a great smooth shave. It doesn&#x27;t hurt to use it every day like my rotary did. I just had to get used to using a different motion on my face to make it work (lines instead of circles). I have a goatee so the trimmer is important and it works well, though it takes a bit of getting used to the new sight line because it extends from the front of the razor (as opposed to the top). Cleaning system does the trick, but you do have to reserve some counter space for it near the outlet, as it needs a secure base. All in all, I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have had several shavers in my life. Norelco and most recently the [[ASIN:B000G1EQ1W Braun Series 5 (8995) Men&#x27;s Shaver]]. When Braun went to the the Gillette screen for the Series 5, things started to work much slower. I found that the shaver was binding a lot more on the longer thicker hairs on my chin. Naturally I was a little upset that a cross promo had screwed up my Shaver. My assumption is the shaver has an older motor and does not have the adequate power to handle the new screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I thought to punish Braun by not buying their product again. But then I read the reviews of the 790cc. I had to buy it. I have shaved twice since getting it from Amazon. The first was a 5 day beard, the 2nd was a 2 day beard. This shaver means business. Not only did it not skip a beat with the long hairs, it shaved closer than anything I have ever used (including razors).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it is expensive, but I think for something you have to do daily, it is worth every penny. Nothing looks worse than razor burn or missed hairs first thing in the morning and this shaver takes care of both with ease.</li>
    <li> This shaver is the best I&#x27;ve ever owned.  It gives me a closeness in shaving I didn&#x27;t think was possible.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I purchased the 790cc Pulsonic Shaver about 1 month ago and I can confirm what other users have found -- it is by far the best shaver that I have ever purchased and gives me the closest shave for an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t get any better than this system. Thoughtfully designed and beautifully executed. Excellent quality shaving results time after time. If you prefer an electric shaver, you owe it to yourself to consider the Series 7 790cc shaving system.    Save time and aggravation by letting the shaver maintain itself. You get the benefit of time savings, and a fresh shaver each time you reach for it. An occasional use of the supplied cleaning brush, and a quick rinse under the tap will extend the life of the cleaning solution beyond the advertised 30 day average replacement cycle.</li>
    <li> C&#x27;è poco da dire anzi pochissimo nessun rasoio elettrico può competere con un rasoio  Braun punto !  Ho posseduto un Philips per un&#x27;anno e poi ho comprato un Braun serie 7 e lo posseduto per ben 15 anni,ho cambiato come previsto solo il coltello e la lama ma il resto è intatto, veramente un prodotto fatto come si deve...per questo per il mio nuovo rasoio sono andato sul sicuro ;-)</li>
    <li> Pros: Probably the best electric razor you can buy. Foil/cutterblock mechanism truly conforms to your face. Finally using lithium ion batteries.  Cons: Charge and \\&quot;hygeine\\&quot; indicators are gimmicky. Not sure what the plus/minus buttons do. No hard case. Beard trimmer has regressed from older versions. Expensive.  The magic behind the 790 is the independently-moving shaver heads. Slide your finger across the top and you&#x27;ll see that the movement mimics the independent suspension of a car. The foil/cutterblock follows the same general design Braun has been using for years now -- a trimmer for longer hairs sandwiched between two bar-shaped shaver heads -- but the independent rocking motion is new (at least to me). The shaver heads are spring-loaded and have just the right amount of give to them. Between that and the improved foil hole pattern, it now takes less strokes over my troublesome neck area to get all the weird hairs growing in different directions.  Also new is some kind of vibrational intensity adjustment, controlled by plus and minus buttons on either side of the power button. The general idea is that if the whole thing vibrates harder, it can jar those hard-to-shave hairs around and get them into the holes in the foil. This makes sense in theory but all it seems to do is make more noise. At the lowest intensity, the 790 sounds like most other Braun razors but turns into an annoying rattle at the higher setting. I&#x27;ve been using it for about ten days now, some days doing my whole shave on low, some days on high, sometimes alternating. Other than the sound, it doesn&#x27;t seem to make one bit of difference.  As you could probably guess, the two indicators on the bottom of the handle are over-designed, weird looking, and largely useless. I don&#x27;t need a battery indicator with more granularity than my cell phone; all I need to know is if it&#x27;s close to dying. And the hygiene indicator? Total gimmick. If you sprang for the deluxe model with the cleaning base, you&#x27;re probably going to follow their suggestion and drop it in every time you&#x27;re done shaving. I&#x27;ve been using Braun&#x27;s since long before the Clean &amp; Renew system and I never once thought, \\&quot;Gee, I wonder how much crap is stuck inside my shaver.\\&quot; Still, I suppose it&#x27;s not hurting anything being there.  My biggest complaint with the 790 is that for some reason they decided to swap out their usual slide-up beard trimmer for one that flips out perpendicular to the handle. It&#x27;s clumsy, difficult to open, and just doesn&#x27;t work as well. My old shaving routine involved a lot of back-and-forth between the shaving head and the beard trimmer as I would constantly switch to trimmer mode to cut long hairs that couldn&#x27;t be coaxed into the foil holes. It&#x27;s such a pain in the ass to flip up the trimmer now that I avoid it and end up more aggressively rubbing the shaver head into my neck to get these unruly stragglers.  Another dumb little thing is that they stopped making hard cases for their razors years ago. The new cases are semi-rigid plastic covered with a neoprene-like fabric. I usually bury it in my suitcase between clothes because I&#x27;m afraid that it&#x27;ll get smashed. The old hard cases could withstand getting run over by a truck. They also don&#x27;t make the little plastic shield to go over the top like they used to.  The 790 is another incremental update in the 7-Series. If you&#x27;ve never used a Braun before, you&#x27;ll definitely be in for a treat. If you&#x27;re switching from a Norelco or a Remington, you&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
    <li> In the case of this shaver, the hype really does match reality. The shaver is by far the best electric I&#x27;ve ever used, and it&#x27;s very nicely engineered--from the ergonomics of the shaving unit to the self-cleaning/lubricating mechanism that comes with the shaver. It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but you get your money&#x27;s worth out of this one.  ----------------------    After nearly two years of using this shaver I can update my original review (above) as follow:    (1) Have replaced the head once, which is right on schedule  (2) I stil love the shaves I get from this shaver.  (3) The trimmer works, but will no longer stay closed (cheap mechanism here).  (4) I&#x27;m surprised by the number of people who try to save cleaning fluid by only cleaning the head once in a while. The fact is that you can get as many cleanings as you want until evaporation requires a new cartridge. By not cleaning, you&#x27;re not saving anything.     Still give it 5-stars.</li>
    <li> Too expensive for what you get as a product.  This shaver doesn&#x27;t shave that well.  For one thing it is too loud and doesn&#x27;t shave neck hair.  I bought a norelco shaver and I like that one better but I guess its a personal choice.</li>
    <li> Although a bit steep in price, it performs as advertised. I have owned a 7000 series Braun and was getting fed up with the amount of times it took going over my chin, neck and area below the ear  on the jawbone. This razor did an excellent job in a minimal amount of time with a close shave I haven&#x27;t experienced in years. I highly recommend this shaver if you can handle the price.</li>
    <li> This was a birthday gift for my husband so it&#x27;s not a firsthand review.  However, he has raved about it.  I last got him a shaver about six or seven years ago and it was starting to peeter out.  It was also a Braun and seeing as it took so long to finally go, after being dropped on the tile floor a couple of times, it&#x27;s obviously well made.  My husband has sensitive skin and he&#x27;s had no problem with it.  It&#x27;s a little queiter than his previous model as well.  I also like that you don&#x27;t have to lock it into the stand to get it to charge and clean because that was sometimes a pain with his other one.  And the razor itself does all the cleaning and charging automatically without having to be set.  So, overall, very cool razor. :)</li>
    <li> I purchased the Braun Pulsonic System  shaver to see how it performed and have found it to exceed my expectations.  It does a fine job with my beard and trimming of mustache, etc. and the cleaning and charging mechanisims are excellent.  I plan to travel with it out of the country and the atomatic adjustable power supply makes it a \\&quot;no brainer.\\&quot;    I highly recommend it to everyone who is looking for a comfortable shaver that is well made and lives up to the hipe!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco models, which include the 6885XL, for over 20 years. By and large, they were all very disappointing. By comparison, the Braun Pulsonic 9595CC with LCD is orders of magnitude better.     Shaving with 6885XL, I&#x27;d often end up with fair-sized sections of wholly uncut hair and of the hair it did cut, it wasn&#x27;t terribly close. It almost looked as if I didn&#x27;t shave! The Braun just wipes my face with the Norelco, so to speak. It doesn&#x27;t leave spots, period. And it&#x27;s close across my entire face. So close, I just feel skin on my cheeks. Yes, for the first time, I think I can say that electric shaving \\&quot;is there\\&quot;. It&#x27;s reached the point of doing the job it&#x27;s set out to do.  I think one of the reasons why Norelco models fail so miserably is that while their lift and cut system was patented, what actually happens is that the metal foil over the razor mats some of the hair down and the blades never get to see it. The Braun takes a different approach. The centerpiece vibrates like a little jack hammer and I&#x27;m surmising this causes the hairs to jump up tall, and the trailing half of the razor reaches them before they can bend back down. This means it does most of the work as opposed to the leading half (until you move in the other direction and their roles reverse). I don&#x27;t know if this is true, but it&#x27;s my guess behind the engineering logic. But I do know that it works!    The Braun also has another nice feature. The Norelcos store cut hair behind the foil assembly and it has to be emptied periodically. I do this over the toilet bowl and one time, the entire assembly fell into the toilet. You won&#x27;t have to worry about the Braun doing that. It comes with its own razor-washing gizmo. I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know how it will work out long-term, but so far as I can tell, it completely cleans the razor out and it does this after every use, so long as you remember to put it back and press the clean button.     The only downside is that it&#x27;s expensive andsomewhat noisy. But it is so good otherwise, that this is almost nitpicking.     Basically, I&#x27;d say if ever other electric razor were to be discontinued tomorrow, I wouldn&#x27;t care. The Braun 9595CC stands alone as the best electric razor in the industry.</li>
    <li> I have had this razor for about 6 weeks and I can honestly say that it is the best electric shaver I have ever owned.  I had a Braun razor previously which was quite good but the cleaning system failed - at least this system does not have an &#x27;over the top&#x27; connector setup which failed early on.  The only downside of this unit is the loud noise during operation and the price.  Other than that, it gives a good, fast shave.</li>
    <li> I have both the Braun 9595 Pulsonic electric razors and the Norelco Arcitec 1090X. So I am qualified to compare the two. The Braun is the hands down better shaver and the best shaver I have ever used. The shaver hugs your face and the vibration system is comfortable almost massage like. Shaving with this shaver actually feels good. The Norelco takes TWICE as long to shave my face and with poorer results. The Norelco requires much more do-over work than the Braun and because it is so light it is difficult to control with precision. The Norelco missed hairs even after lengthy shaves. Also, the Braun comes with the nifty base station that cleans the shaver and charges it. Take my word for it the Braun is a hands down winner when you compare these two shavers.</li>
    <li> This is my first review of a product ever, only because I feel so disappointed with this product. I&#x27;ve been using a Braun Synchro electric for about 4 years and have been looking to upgrade. After reading the positive reviews for the Pulsonic (and ignoring the negatives) I went out and put down the almost $200 for this razor. Here&#x27;s are the pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s, at least in my experience:    Pro&#x27;s: Great looking razor, comfortable fit in your hand, and the base unit is smaller and cleaner in appearance than older models (the base is also somewhat smaller, if you&#x27;re tight on room). Yes, it is loud but no louder than other Braun&#x27;s - it is definitely louder than a Norelco I&#x27;ve used but unless you live around light sleepers it&#x27;s not a big deal. It is very responsive to your face, as the head has multiple moving/adjusting parts to it so it does hug the contours of your neck and face well, which is great for sensitive faces. The cleaning system is also much improved, meaning it doesn&#x27;t clean for 20+ minutes and go through fluid as quickly if the razor doesn&#x27;t require a heavy cleaning, which is something I liked.    Con&#x27;s: I think Braun sacrificed comfort and sensitivity for closeness of shave on this one. I was REALLY excited when I first got this, thinking it would be the best shave I&#x27;ve had. After the first shave I was a little disappointed, but thought I&#x27;d give it another shot. After a week, I quickly realized it wasn&#x27;t as close as my older Braun Synchro. To test it, I shaved immediately following with my Synchro and it picked up a lot more hair quite easily. I was shocked, and sad that I had to return this. Since all the blades on the head move so easily, it&#x27;s just hard to get in there and get that close stubble - it always looked like I had a day&#x27;s growth after finishing with this shaver, which isn&#x27;t good enough - especially given the high price.     If you are just looking for a fancy shaver that gives a decent cut and is sensitize to your face, this is a great choice. If, however, you&#x27;re looking for a very close shave - this is not for you. Whatever you do, make sure you can return it to where you purchased it so you can try it out - I&#x27;d hate to have not been able to return this after my test run with it. I really wanted this to be my Christmas present for myself this year - instead I&#x27;ll just stick with my Synchro until something else comes along.</li>
    <li> I have had several Braun shavers and this seems to be the best. My only complaint is that you spend $200 plus dollars for this and all they give you is a cheap plastic case for this shaver that looks like an old shampoo bottle. They used to give you a nice travel case.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks of using this razor I have had problems. This razor would not work with the power cord. Braun&#x27;s service facilities do not have parts. Braun has lied to me saying that parts were available. They are not.&lt;br /&gt;The service was the worst service I have ever seen. Don&#x27;t buy this!!!!</li>
    <li> I used electrics in the past - mostly Norelco style - used them since I didn&#x27;t know any better... that&#x27;s what I started shaving with.  A decade later and I had to use a real razor on vacation... man what a difference - the electrics couldn&#x27;t hold a flame...... until now.     I can&#x27;t explain how well and how painless this shaver really is.  Quick - saves me time.  Painless - no after burn, no pulling hairs, gets the thickest patches of hair (my chin) without any ache (something my old electrics would tear me up so I&#x27;d have to go real slow to get it all)... Clean - self cleaning makes it like new everytime - just look at it after it&#x27;s done - it&#x27;s brand spanking new!  Sure the heads probably wear, but I&#x27;ve had it for over a month now and the thing is just like new.  I&#x27;ve read that the heads are supposed to be changed out every 18 months... what a savings in razors alone!!    Someone else on here said it made shaving fun - it really has.  I used to shave every other day since it took so long and I hated all the mess and hassle... now I want to shave twice a day :)  Sometimes I have... it really is great and comes with a nice travel container too.  Charge lasts a long time even on my thick stubbly face.     I&#x27;m overly impressed with what this thing does to the basics of shaving... Can&#x27;t recommend it enough!!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed that my husband wasn&#x27;t THRILLED with the shaver, given the hype and the price.  He says it does a good job shaving, but he says it is so large that he isn&#x27;t sure if he wants to take in when we travel, which is fairly often.  I am happy because it cleans itself, so I feel it is much more hygenic this way.  I&#x27;ll get him to take it on his next trip, and we can see if plugging up the cleaning solution for travel is worth it all.</li>
    <li> I have used quite a few different electric shavers over the years and this one is by far the best!  Prior to buying this one I owned a Braun Activator and before that a Braun Syncro system.  The pulsonic shaves much faster and more comfortably than any of the other&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used.  I hate shaving, period, but it&#x27;s not so bad with this one!  The price is the highest I&#x27;ve ever paid for a shaver, but I don&#x27;t mind spending the money to get a good product, so I&#x27;m very happy!  Plus Amazon has by far the lowest price - even on the better model, which has the LCD screen.  It&#x27;s nice being able to see battery strength and cleaning level display graphically.  Braun&#x27;s cleaning system is also by far the best I&#x27;ve seen and it&#x27;s nice that they&#x27;ve stayed with the same refill cartridge design over the years, so I didn&#x27;t have to throw the ones I already had away when my old shaver died - they work with this one too.  This is a purchase that I&#x27;m very happy with and would highly recomend this product, especially if you don&#x27;t enjoy shaving.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about spending so much money on an electric shaver, but from my husbands reaction it was money well spent. My husband says its as close to a hand razor as you can get and when I feel his face I can&#x27;t feel the difference. He says its easy and quick to use and very quiet as well. I give this an A+</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Dad for Christmas.  He&#x27;s thrilled with it, and said it shaves closer than a blade.</li>
    <li> I really like this shaver.  It is a definite improvement over the Braun I had previously.  It is lighter and shaves closer and faster.  Also the new battery technology will allow me to take it on a week long trip without lugging the power cord.  Well done Braun!</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best electric shaver I have ever used.  The charging and cleaning base needs some improvement.  You have to push a button to start the cleaning process.  With previous Braun models they automatically started cleaning when the shaver was placed into the base.</li>
    <li> The product is great but it took too long to ship, despite the fact that it was in stock</li>
    <li> I read some of the other reviews and was a little skeptical, but I&#x27;m foolish, so I bought the $250 shaver anyway.  Turns out it is great.  I&#x27;ve had it for two months and I&#x27;ve largely stopped razor shaving since I got this thing.  That&#x27;s not to say it&#x27;s the same as razor shaving, but it&#x27;s very, very, close.  It is, hands down, the best electric shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten.  After shaving it feels like a razor shave, but the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow seems to come sooner than with the razor.  I can&#x27;t tell if the pulsing or all the other super-gadgetry is doing the trick, but it is great.  The cleaning system is nice too.  It is kinda loud, but you don&#x27;t have to run it at 5 in the morning and wake up your wife.  It is comforting to see the ridiculous amount of shaved hair and what not in the cleaner cartridge when you swap it out.  All in all, I am very happy with it; it gives a great shave and the cleaning system seems to keep it very clean (and lemon-fresh too!).  If you&#x27;re happy with your shaver or don&#x27;t have to shave every day (I&#x27;m in the military, so I have to), stick with what you have or the razor.  If you&#x27;re looking for a new one and need something that gives a close shave and you don&#x27;t have to spend an hour disassembling and cleaning it once a week, get this thing.  Caveat: all I can say about reliability is that I&#x27;ve had this thing for two months and it hasn&#x27;t given me any trouble at all.</li>
    <li> for a while i had been considering switching to an electric razor...but i was a little stand-offish after hearing that you can&#x27;t get as close as a blade...i didn&#x27;t want a sandpaper face after spending a good bit of money on a razor...so i borrowed a rotary razor from my grandfather and decided the shave wasn&#x27;t as bad as i expected...so after doing a good bit of research...i decided on the braun 9595...holy cow did this ever do the trick...from the get go i had a shave that was just as close as a blade...no irritation, smooth skin, quick shave, easy operation, and it cleans and recharges itself in the dock...the cleaning system is very nice...not only does it leave the razor smelly nice and citrusy...but the dock also lets you know the level of the cleaning solution...also...i thought a 1 hr charge only yeilding 50 minutes of shaving was odd...but as it turns out...i have to clean it 2 or 3 times before the charge gets halfway down...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only reason this didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is b/c i have to work a little hard sometimes to get all the hairs on my neck...but its usually not a big deal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would reccomend this razor to anyone and everyone...i might go as far to say that this is the best money can buy</li>
    <li> This is the best shaving system I have had. I am 57 years old so have used quit a few, and I can tell this is the best. Expensive but worth it. Its cleaning system is great since I get brand new senstion every time I use it.</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend and he really likes it however, he said that it did cut his face the first few times that he used it.</li>
    <li> Five stars for the shaver, 1 star for the liquid cleaning system. I&#x27;ve had the system for only 3 months and it&#x27;s started to leak during the cleaning process. For a shaver costing twice other competing models, this is extremely disappointing.</li>
    <li> This is my first Braun and overall I am satisfied after using it about a month.  It shaves much faster and closer than my old Norelco.  The only negatives are price and it is a little noisy.</li>
    <li> I had looked forward to this shaver, but it does not shave my beard well, and has also cut my face as well as caused me severe razor burn. After reading many reviews on here, i felt this was the best shaver available, but after two weeks of use, i find myself extremely disappointed in this product. Braun has a great reputation in their electric shavers, but from my perspective they missed on this one.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely exceptional. I would highly recommend it to anyone. It is the best shaving system I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s fast, clean,economical,adequate and does the job! I have owned the 7000 series for seven years; never had a problem.the pulsonic is faster,easier to hold,all around a better shave!the best shaver on the market.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor after my wife said I needed a new one.  It cost $200!  It doesn&#x27;t work any better than my 5-6 year old norelco, not to say that means it&#x27;s bad, just not any better.  I&#x27;ve needed to do little with the norelco except rinse it out under the tap.  Never replaced original blade wheels even.  The pulsonic wants to give me it \\&quot;hygiene\\&quot; and wants me to clean it when IT decides that&#x27;s needed.  It goes through a little song and dance as it does so, with flashing lights and various sounds.  You&#x27;ll also have to buy the hygiene solution about monthly, and it costs a lot more than tap water.  I cannot understand why any sane designer thinks this kind of crap (excuse my anglo-saxon) and also spoiling the relative purity of a quiet early morning with &#x27;hygiene&#x27; paranoia will appeal to anyone with much cortex left.  There, I&#x27;m feeling better.</li>
    <li> As a longtime Norelco user (the last a 9160XL), I finally grew tired of their product breaking like clockwork every two-plus years just after the warranty period had passed.  Also, the frequent pinching &amp; razor burn was getting me down.  Time to switch.  I remember many, many years ago when I was buying my first razor that I pined for a Braun, but lacked deep enough pockets to make up the difference (at that time) between the two.  Times change and prices have balanced, but now the product differential is very significant!  The Braun flat whoops Norelco!    I&#x27;ve had the Braun for about 6 or 8 weeks now, and must say that the shave is closer, it is quicker, and most amazingly to me, it is far more consistent than I ever experienced with Norelco.  With the latter, I would always note that a random area of my face or neck would have been missed - not so with the Braun, as it gets all areas of my face and neck baby smooth.  My young daughters have both commented on Daddy&#x27;s face not being rough anymore.  That in itself gets the Braun 5 stars!!!  And whether or not the \\&quot;Pulsonic\\&quot; system is helping the shaver shave closer, I don&#x27;t care, it just feels terrific on my face.  ;-)    The cleaning system is great - yes it adds expense, but at the price point of the razor, I can afford it.  And I have found that not having to deal with cleaning stubble out of the razor, and from the sink makes it worth every penny.    From a transparency standpoint, like every razor before, I did have an early learning curve to determine how to best shave with this new machine, which did result in a few early bouts of razor burn at points, but once I figured it out, it has been smooth sailing ever since!    Braun has won me over, and if they continue to deliver, I will never go back!  Do yourself a favor, and pick up one of these for yourself, and anyone else you know who needs a razor.  It rocks!    One consideration - this is a \\&quot;Ground Ship Only\\&quot; item as the box contains one cleaning cartridgethat is considered a hazardous material to shippers.  So if that matters, take note!  Good luck!</li>
    <li> I have owned several electric shavers in the past and tried many. My past favorite was the Braun syncro shaver which I have owned for 14 years and it still works good. Recently, I decided to try several of the new rotary shavers and they were just OK. Next I read several reviews of the new Braun pulsonic 9595 and since I really like my sonic toothbrush, I decided to buy the Braun 9595 from Amazon when it was on sale. Wow! What a fast and smooth shaver! It is easily twice as fast and shaves very close for an electric shaver. I especially like the option to rinse it out in the sink when I travel. This shaver is a keeper! Best of the best.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Braun Pulsonic System 9595 in March 2008, and within the past week I&#x27;ve had issues with the cleaning system.  The shaver does not charge or clean, leading me to assume that the contact points the cleaning system uses to detect the razor are not working properly.  If I leave the shaver stored in the cleaning system, it seems that the battery is drained.  When I attempted to use the shaver this morning, it was completely dead, even though I only used it for approximately 5-10 minutes after the last complete charge.  I also found that the shaver charges when the AC adaptor is plugged directly into the shaver.    I decided to call Braun customer service, and they will very apologetic about my issue.  They logged my issue in their system and asked me a few questions to better understand my problem.  I was informed that I would have to send the shaver out for repairs at a local licensed service station.  I was a little disappointed that I needed to involve a third party, but it seemed to be the only option.  My next call was to local service center (only licensed repair shop; not related to Braun), and they informed me that they are only open 9-5 on Monday - Friday.  Since I work full-time, it will be difficult to get to the service center.  The service center also told me that normal repairs take about 4-5 days.  What am I supposed to do without my shaver for about a week (if I&#x27;m lucky)?  If I could use a regular razor, I&#x27;d use that all of the time.    Please keep in mind that I have been using Braun shavers for about 10 years, and this is the first issue that I have had with their products.  I am disappointed that a $200 shaver does not work after 5 months of use.  Other than this issue, I can not complain about the product.  The shave is great compared to my older Braun model.</li>
    <li> If you have always wanted the brand new latest technology Braun Pulsonic razor I recommend you visit your nearest Sears store.  I just bought one (unopened, brand new) on clearance today (Cincinnati) for $100!  No kidding.  Listed for $269.  The replacement heads were on clearance for $30.  You can get the \\&quot;360\\&quot; model for $85.  Felt like a kid on Christmas!!  It took about 5 minutes getting it out of the plastic packaging which is held in place by some weird plastic rivots. I thought it was going to be vibrating up a storm..but didn&#x27;t really feel anything out of the ordinary for an electric razor.  It does work very well...but as others have stated I did have to rub a little more in certain areas on my neck. The automatic cleaner/charger (in my opinion) is more a gimmick  than a necessity.  But I like \\&quot;gadgets\\&quot; so it is fun to play with.&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable too with a cool sophisticated appearance.  Full charge in under 1 hour.  SD alcohol comes in the cleaning cartridge..and you probably could refill if you are inclined to do so.  The alcohol supposedly comes with a fragrance and a lubricant which you may find more difficult to replacate since you don&#x27;t have the exact formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes this story so interesting is I almost bought one at a local department store on sale for $219..and just by pure luck stumbled on the ones on clearance at Sears.  Heck..even Walmart is charging $269 for these..and they only give their employees 5% off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck..and shop at sears next time you want a bargain!!</li>
    <li> As a satisfied owner of the Braun Activator series I was eager to try the new Pulsonic after I read the mostly rave reviews about it from other users. I reasoned that if the Activator shave was very, very good, the Pulsonic would be excellent, so I choked down my revulsion to the astronomical price ($253 incl. tax even at Wal-Mart!) and gave it a try. The shave it gave was good, but as far as I could tell it was no real improvement over the Activator in terms of its closeness or the time it took to achieve good results. (In fact, it may have taken me longer to shave as I found that the noise was so loud from the Pulsonic vibrations that I couldn&#x27;t really hear the sound of the hairs being shaved and so probably went over the same area several times just to make sure!) The only real plus I saw vs. the Activator was that it seemed to cause a little less irritation. Ultimately, I decided that I had paid too much in proportion to the benefit received and returned the razor.</li>
    <li> Great Product.  It was well worth the money.  It gives a terrific shave.   I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The shaver cuts nearly as close as a blade and does not irritate the skin.  I have been using electric razors for over 20 years (mostly Norelcos) and this shaver gives the closest shave of all.  It is a little noisy and has considerable vibration compared to the Norelcos.  The hygene indicator and battery level indicator is nice.  The automatic cleaning level selection works well also.</li>
    <li> This electric shaver gives the closest shave that I have experienced with an electric shaver.  For years I have used a blade as I wanted a close shave, but when I recently shaved off my beard, I thought I&#x27;d go back to an electric.  This shaver has fit the bill.  A bit pricey, but in my estimation worth it.  The cleaning process -- you can run it through a wet cleaning after each shave -- is a very good feature and likely increases the cost.  The cleaning process is somewhat noisier than I&#x27;d like, but I just close the bathroom door to decrease the noise to an acceptable level.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have had the Braun 9595 since last Christmas and other than the trimmer part breaking, it still works. I have had all their other models prior to this one and found all to be of high quality. I shave every day on my way into the office and never had an issue with any of their products other than the trimmer breaking prematurely on the 9595. I don&#x27;t even use that thing and why and how it broke- I don&#x27;t know. One day I found it protruding off the shaver body and it would not reseat.     The side trimmer broke on the new one and seems very flimsy as compared to the 8995. I am super careful with all my devices and handle them with care as well as always using the case. One day I went to use it and the trimmer was protruding off the shaver body. What and why it did that, I don&#x27;t know and, I did not take it apart to see what failed. But, for what they cost, I don&#x27;t think that these seven series are built like the 8995 or the one before that. I still have / own both of the predecessors to the 9595 and both still work perfectly. They are built like tanks.     Ergonimics: One thing that I didn&#x27;t like was the ergonomic design of the 7 series vs. the 8995. I found the older model easier to hold and that it had a beefier/ better build quality to it. It feels more solid to me and I can hold it from any direction and it feels great. The 9595 is contoured a bit and makes holding it from the end or upside down feel awkward.    Cleaning: THe older model is a bit quieter when cleaning and I liked the grey stand with Blue LEDs vs. the white stand. The white shows dirt and grime more and, the white one doesn&#x27;t always indicate when it&#x27;s clean as the LEDs go out after it&#x27;s been sitting for a period of time whereas the 8995 cleaning system maintains a constant \\&quot;always on\\&quot; status so you know whether it&#x27;s clean or not. I have had issues with the 9595 where it did not clean and I had no way of knowing it due to all the LEDs were out on the base. Even though I pressed the \\&quot;start cleaning\\&quot; button, and it lit up, it did not clean the shaver. This is due to how Braun designed it to be less power consuming. Whether they changed this part of the design since I got mine last season- I don&#x27;t know. It should be noted that the reason it would not clean or charge was due to the two metal electrical contacts on the base were not making good contact with the shaver. I had to use IPA to clean the contacts from oxidation and press them in and let them pop out of the shaver base as well as checking the contacts on the shaver. That part was fine. IT&#x27;s the base contacts that were the issue.    Shave quality: Both perform just as good in my experience with the newer one providing a quicker, faster cut due to higher cutting speeds but, it comes at the expense of more heat due to friction and higher vibration in the handle and cutter head. I used to cease shaving for minutes to allow it to cool down before continuing on. I used to use a light machine oil on my shaver to help prevent friction build up but, I went back to the 8995 as it works better for me. I can keep shaving with that and not get friction burned, it cleans up better, charge lasts longer, is more ergo friendly as you can hold it any direction and it feels better, there&#x27;s less vibration, the side trimmer is stronger built and is lined up directly with the cutter head to help pop lay down hairs up better than the 9595. The 9595 protrudes at an angle off the body and is not lined up with the cutter head.     I find with the 8995 that I can go sideways or along the length of the cutter head to get in extremely close. I can&#x27;t do that on the newer style 9595 cutterhead. However, for long beards or, when I haven&#x27;t shaved in a month, the 9595 does not pull. The 8995 does grab in that case. But, for everyday use, I find that both provide a very close shave.      Summary:   The 9595 and the 8995 perform equally as shavers good based on my every day use with both for about a year. The cleaning base on the 9595 is notas good as the older base and the build quality doesn&#x27;t seem as good as the 8995 based on my experience with the trimmer breaking. I also found the 9595 to become hot due to friction of the foil. Even when new, I found this to be irritating to my face. The older one runs slower cutting speeds and is cooler / less irritating.</li>
    <li> I got this to replace my 5 year old 7680 whose battery was starting to run dry. This new one&#x27;s okay, but the old model cost $50 less, cuts closer, has a better trimmer and has a more solid \\&quot;built-in-Germany\\&quot; feel to it.  The new one does not look or feel like a $200 shaver.  I&#x27;d recommend saving $50 and getting the superior 7680...</li>
    <li> This is easily the best electric shaver that I have ever used and the first that I have used outside of the Philips Norelco product line. I started with electric shavers years ago when I purchased a Norelco foil shaver. I quickly switched to a Norelco rotary shaver and used that for some time.     I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for about a week and am thoroughly impressed. The pop-up trimmer has \\&quot;Made in Germany\\&quot; written on it and you can definitely tell German engineering went into it. The shaver feels very solid and well built. Don&#x27;t get confused with the customer shot above in that the Series 7 - 790cc (9595) has an LCD display on the base to display \\&quot;battery\\&quot; and \\&quot;hygiene\\&quot; status - not a series of LEDs.    The operating controls are very simple. There is an on/off button that glows blue when the shaver is on, a tiny recessed reset button that can be pressed with a paperclip that resets the blade change counter, a button labeled \\&quot;release\\&quot; that allows the blade cartridge to be removed, and a button labeled \\&quot;lock\\&quot; that locks the shaving portion of the razor at an angle for shaving the neck. On the back of the shaver are two metal contacts for charging the unit through the supplied base and a receptacle for plugging in cord in case the battery is dead and you can&#x27;t wait for it to recharge through the base. The battery in the shaver is lithium ion (Li-ion) instead of nickel cadmium (NiCd) making battery \\&quot;memory\\&quot; problems obsolete and is advertised to run for 50 minutes before being fully discharged.     One of the biggest selling points for me on this razor was the inclusion of the self-cleaning base station. This thing is nice! When you finish shaving you simply insert the shaver into the base and the base analyzes the \\&quot;hygiene\\&quot; condition of the shaver and selects a cleaning program ranging from \\&quot;eco\\&quot; to \\&quot;intensive\\&quot; and dries the razor. The advertised cleaning time is 32 to 43 minutes depending upon the cleaning program selected and I found this to be accurate. The cleaning cartridges must be purchased separately (although one is included) and replaced every 30 days with daily use. If you&#x27;re not shaving every day it is recommended that the cleaning cartridges be replaced every eight weeks as the alcohol based cleaning solution in them evaporates over time. The base station has indicator lights on it to advise when to change the cleaning cartridges. A two pack of cleaning cartridges cost me approximately $8.00 at a local store.    The only other ongoing cost associated with this shaver is the replacement of the cutter cassette that is recommended every 18 months and run approximately $30.00. Compared to the high cost of disposable razors that must be purchased constantly and the convenience of not having to clean this razor it is a steal! The only problem I have run into with this unit is that it does leave some stubble on the neck area especially around the Adam&#x27;s Apple but as I have continued to learn how to best use this shaver it has gotten much better. I have serious problems shaving irritating my skin after shaving and I have thus has to wait several days between shaves. With this shaver I can now shave every other day with absolutely no problems. It also gives me the closest shave that I have ever had with an electric shaver and it rivals regular disposable razors. Overall, I highly recommend this shaver to anyone new to electric shavers or looking for a replacement.</li>
    <li> The Braun 790cc Pulsonic Shaver completely eradicated my opinion that it is impossible to get a close shave with an electric shaver.  I&#x27;ve had electric shavers in the past, Norelco rotaries and Panasonic wet/dry shavers, and none of them ever gave me a satisfyingly close shave.  They would also irritate my skin, because I&#x27;d end up going back over and over my beard, trying to get the darn thing to shave closer.      This Braun however, shaves me closer than I ever thought was possible without using a blade.  It shaves close with just a couple of passes, even under my chin and on my neck, which have always been my problem areas.  It does so without pulling and yanking the hairs too (another lovely characteristic of my past shavers). No, it&#x27;s not as close as a blade, but it almost is; and it won&#x27;t leave your skin chaffed or knicked as can happen when using a blade.  Bottom line is, you can&#x27;t get a closer more comfortable shave with any other electric shaver.  And the self-cleaning function leaves this baby feeling brand new every time you use it.  It&#x27;s worth it&#x27;s price!</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my husband for Christmas. This was the best gift. He doesn&#x27;t say much about it, but he uses it every day. This is his first electric razor in all of his 62 years. It has to be good for him to use it!</li>
    <li> I am new to using an electric shaver after 30 years of using MachIII type razors. I recently tried a Norelco shaver (approx $80.00 unit) that had belonged to my father-in-law, liked it, and started using it daily. Then I decided to get the \\&quot;best there is\\&quot; and bought this Braun. It works just as well, and I like it just as well, as the $80.00 Norelco. I find it no better and no worse, but definitely a LOT more expensive.    What I really don&#x27;t like is buying the 30 day cleaning cartridges.</li>
    <li> I received a Braun Series 7 for Xmas 08, and it is a great gift!  I had been wanting to try a Braun, but a little leery since owning a Norelco years ago and not having the best experience.  I can&#x27;t testify to the present Norelco, but this Braun does the job!  It feels good in your hand, it doesn&#x27;t pull as others have stated, and it gets about as close a shave as I believe is possible with an electric razor.  The pulsonic technology does not rattle your jaw like the battery powered Fusion.    Of course there&#x27;s the requirement of continuous purchases for the clean &amp; renew solution, but I&#x27;ve been shaving a full month now with regular cleanings and I&#x27;m still showing that I have a \\&quot;high\\&quot; quantity of solution remaining.  It&#x27;s a cheaper option than the repeat straight razor purchases we all make.    The only negative, and this is stretching it, is if you have a light sleeping partner and you&#x27;re a morning shaver (who isn&#x27;t, right?).  The Braun has a distinctive high humming sound to it (not annoying to me) which could make for a grumpy awakening to those not expecting it.  That goes for the cleaning function as well.</li>
    <li> I wanted to buy my husband the very best shaver available, and at more than $200 this was supposed to be it.  I read all the reviews and most of them were positive.  I gave it to him for Christmas and we found that it just doesn&#x27;t give the kind of close shave one would expect.  His $10 Mach III razor shaves closer.  Plus the cleaning function is LOUD.</li>
    <li> This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever submitted online and it&#x27;s because this is the best product I have bought in years.  First some background: My face has always disliked shaving immensely. I have never used an electric shaver on a regular basis - tried a few times in the past but my face would breakout badly each time.  With a razor I have never been able to shave correctly, against the grain, because my face would breakout that way as well.  Shaving with the grain I would still end up with zits daily as a direct result of shaving (I am now 50 years old). In fact it had gotten to the point where I couldn&#x27;t shave daily and ended up using the razor every other day.  I have been looking for another option, even considered laser hair removal.  So after seeing something about the Braun Pulsonic I was intrigued and after some investigation, incluiding reading all the reviews I could find, I decided to take the plunge and buy one, hoping that it would work as advertised.  All I can say is WOW!  After reading all the comments about giving your face 2-4 weeks to adjust I was prepared for the worst.  The first day I tried it I took it easy not getting too close and my face felt good afterward and no breakouts like anticipated.  I then tried shaving the next day, haven&#x27;t shaved two days in a row in a few years, and it felt better as I got used to it and again my face felt fine throughout the day with no breakouts.  The real EUREKA! moment came on day 3 when I decided to really go at it to get the closest shave I could.  I worked it every which way and the result was, BY FAR, the closest shave I have ever had.  Again, my face felt great afterward.  I have used the Pulsonic for 3 weeks now (5-6 days/week) and not only does my face love it but my girlfriend REALLY likes the difference.  When I asked her about it last week she said \\&quot;It&#x27;s great, no more sandpaper!\\&quot;  I know it&#x27;s not cheap and may not give you as close a shave if you&#x27;re able to use a blade razor as it&#x27;s meant to be be used, but for me and my face IT&#x27;S WORTH EVERY PENNY!!  I will NEVER go back blades.  Thanks Braun!</li>
    <li> This is the first review I have ever written, being basically a retired, lazy 65 yr. old man. I used electric shaves through my college years, and suffered many uncomfortable days. I switched to a blade in my early 20&#x27;s for both the comfort and closeness. Unfortunately, I have developed peripheral nueropathy besides having to take Coumadin. The two combined made me not want to shave very frequently. I started reading reviews on the latest electrics. I decided to take the plunge on the Pulsonic. WOW!!!  Although there are many more great reviews than bad ones, I was still amazed at the closeness and comfort of this shaver. No red splotches, no burn, just a very close shave. I could not be happier with this purchase! Also, when I travel, I take just the shaver and cord, and clean it as directed under warm, running tap water. I have not had to use the cord yet! The battery has gotten me through a ten day trip with no problem.  I would reccomend this shaver to anyone, and have! I hope this review is helpful to someone considering this purchase.</li>
    <li> this razor was a dissapointment. commercials...reviwes.....stats all sounded good. truth is the base in smelly and noisy, shaver heats up fast and kinda bruns your skin. the floating head was nice the shave was no good. i use to have a panasonic and replaced it with this....not good. i went back and bought a new panasonic model. so i shaved with the braun and still had stubble in some areas....went over the stubble with my new panasonic and wooosh....GONE!!! so please do yourself a favor...buy a panasonic!!</li>
    <li> The razor&#x27;s pretty expensive, but overall, it performs fairly well.  If you go to long and let your hair grow to long, though, it has a hard time picking up on those hairs and then you have to use the trimmer to bring the length of the hair down first.    The cleaner solution and mechanism works well, but the solution runs out too quickly and can get expensive too.  I don&#x27;t even buy cleaner solution anymore.  I just brush out the stubble as best as I can after each shave and keep on truckin&#x27;.  Still shaves well that way.    I&#x27;ve had this shaver for well over a year and I haven&#x27;t had to change the head yet, so that&#x27;s good because those can be expensive too.  I shave maybe every other day, but sometimes only once a week too, so that could add to the longevity of the heads, but I do still think it&#x27;s lasted quite a while.  The foil top of the head seems pretty tough too.  I remember having a Remington shaver and the screen on that would get worn through so easily and then cut me.  That hasn&#x27;t been a problem with this at all.    I like the pivoting head.  It has worked out really well for me.    The charge lasts a long time.  Don&#x27;t leave it plugged in all the time.  Let the battery run down before charging.  I do wish that it had a button that allowed you to decide when to charge and when not to charge so that you could leave it plugged in, but it doesn&#x27;t, so I just unplug it until it&#x27;s drained all the way down and then I plug it in to charge up and then unplug it again.    A nice razor overall.</li>
    <li> I got this as a Valentines Day gift for my husband. He wanted it but was back and forth because it was so expensive...so I surprised him with it, because Amazon was selling it for $50 less than the stores. He LOVES this razor and said its the best one he has ever owned. I have to say his skin looks and feels fantastic every time he shaves. Ladies if you are thinking of getting this as a gift for your husband/boyfriend/whatever, stop debating and buy it for him! No more sandpaper face kisses!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco electric shavers for at least 40 years except for a short time when I used a Braun.  This Braun is much better than the previous one I used and Norelco never gave me this close a shave.  It is a bit expensive, including cleaning fluid and replacement heads, but I love it.[[ASIN:B000IWFU3W Braun 790CC Series 7 Men&#x27;s Cordless Shaver]]</li>
    <li> This shaver performs like it&#x27;s worth 20 but costs over 200.    That&#x27;s funny because the PocketGo should be worth 100 but is under 20  It takes 7 min to shave a 3/5 with the Pulsonic. It takes 10 min to shave a 4/5 with the PocketGo. Do the math.  Better yet, go to wegotbetterdeals and buy the sleeper hit of the decade:  the Panasonic ES8243A for 68 bucks. It takes 3 min to get a shave better than the Mach 3.  Shave wet with Aveeno Therapeutic gel (4 bucks) or \\&quot;dry\\&quot; with Williams Lectric Shave Ultra (3 bucks).  Don&#x27;t believe the Pulsonic VIBRATOR hype. I gave mine back to my local bestbuy for a full refund a month after being disappointed every day.  Now I look forward to getting a smooth shave with no cuts after my hot shower with the Panasonic.  I carry the PocketGo when I travel.</li>
    <li> Good razor, great razor for thick neck hair growth. A little on the heavy side. Like it a lot.</li>
    <li> Product did not work as directed.  This shaver did not give a good, close shave.  The Norelco $40 shaver is a better deal.</li>
    <li> I bought this Braun shaver because I have never owned a really nice, high end electric shaver before. I have always used a Remington with good luck; they are durable, reliable, inexpensive, and provide a good but not great shave. I bought this Braun exactly two years ago. I was thrilled with it. I cleaned it every week and did everything the manufacturer asked me to do to keep it in fine working order. I don&#x27;t even use it all that much (M-Th only for about 5 minutes at a time)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Low-and-behold I went to use it this past Monday morning and it was DEAD as a doornail. The charge station is working fine, but the motor inside the shaver is not functioning -not even a click. I expect something this expensive (I paid well over 250 for it) to last for many years. Two years!!!! I could have purchased a new Remington every six months and still saved a bundle. Now I have to struggle with sending this to a repair center so THEY can rip me off too.  It worked great while it worked. I think I will just throw it out and go buy a Remington instead. Save your money and look elsewhere this shaver is a POS!</li>
    <li> I got the Braun 9595 as a present for Christmas 2009, so I&#x27;ve used it for about 30 mo. It works (worked) very well. It gave me a close shave without irritation. I would rinse the head of the shaver under the tap to clean most days and use the base to charge and clean about 2 times a week. After about 12 months I started to notice a fog would happen inside the clear window of the meter. I thought nothing of it because the razor was still working normally. After 18 months, the meter stopped working but again, it didn&#x27;t effect the performance of the shaving so I stuck it out. Right around the same time a spring in the flip up trimmer became dislodged and it would not stay shut. Again, I did not use this feature often, so I wrapped some electric tape around it and continued use. Then this past week it stopped working all together. I assumed the battery had gone dead. I did some research online and thought I might be able to replace the battery with relative ease and not have to buy a new $200+ shaver. So I decided to open the casing and did not like what I saw. The entire inside was corroded and rusty. One battery connector on the back of the unit broke free where it was corroded through. The black backing was stained green from the corrosion and the screws that hold the casing together were rusted. When I opened the case, I found many of the metal parts on the inside were rusted and circuit board had an area that was fried from corrosion. I have pictures I have shared to show you what it looks like. I contacted Braun via e-mail and have not heard a response after 5 days. It is no longer under warrantee, however it does claim to be \\&quot;waterproof\\&quot; and I had higher expectations for a $200+, top of line, best money can buy shaver.</li>
    <li> There is nothing exception about the shaver that merits a $200+ price.  Very disappointed with Braun.  At $35+ per replacement screen not including the cleaning fluid this is the most expensive ordinary shave you will ever have.  I bought it to replace my old Braun electric shaver and was very disappointed to find it wasn&#x27;t any better.  Save your money this shaver is for the guy who has to have... ... well you all know that guy.    Pros  Lots of features like; plastic case to store while traveling, only shaver I know that removes curled set in hair, very ergonomically comfortable, LCD screen to view charge time and cleaning.  This great when travelling and need to know if needs a charge.  It also helps to keep the battery from developing a memory.  Partially drained batteries recharged half way down too many times will no longer discharge past the half way point.  You can drain it as far you want and recharge from there.    Cons  The cutting screens are too far apart allowing the whisker cutter to sometimes scrape (not scratch) across your skin.  But then it wouldn&#x27;t remove the curled set in hair.  The scraping could be mostly my fault since I like to dig in and get a close a shave as possible. but then I never had this problem with my other Braun, lost it.  Almost wish the whisker rake was separate. Heats up because of its high speed motor (the motor is that strong) but nothing uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> This thing rocks.  I love everything about this shaver. I have always used Braun shavers...and this is pretty close to the perfect shaver. Very quiet also as a bonus.  I love the cleaning process and the LCD status for both hygiene and battery.  The CCR cartridges seem to last a long time.  You get what you pay for with this shaver.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a system therefore it is bulky. You have to shave opposite direction to get a smoothe shave. Blades are easy to glide. cleaning can be done maually ot auto. This is only for dry shaving.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for about 2 weeks and could not be happier. It provides a close and comfortable shave. The self-cleaning feature is terrific - it leaves a lemon-fresh smell. The razer is also significantly quieter than my last razor.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent shaver that surpasses previous shavers I have used in terms of ease of use, comfort and quality of shave.  Although it is expensive, I am happy with my purchase.      It has been in the repair shop twice since I purchased it in November 2007  (it is now February 2008).  The first time the repair was done quickly because no parts were involved.  The second repair required parts.  After waiting a month for the part(s) to arrive, I decided that since the shaver was still operable, I would pick it up from the repair shop and check back periodically to see if the part has arrived.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving MANY years and this is the best razor I have ever used - both electric and blade.  The shaver is comfortable to use. It gives a great shave and the cleaning system requires no effort. I actually look forward to shaving every morning!!</li>
    <li> Without doubt, this is the best electronic razer currently on the market.    In the past, I have had three problems with electronic shaver systems:  1. Cleaning   2. Failing to shave close enough/missing hair   3. Pinching    As far as cleaning, this product is top notch. It requires next to no maintenance except exchanging a cleaning pack (which will run you less than $5.00 a month). I shave every day and run my model on ECO clean and my pack last right at two months.      They have definitely improved on how close the razor shaves to your skin and how much hair the razor misses. I hair on my neck grows in random directions and is not consistent. Out of my whole neck, there are probably 4-5 hairs that grow in such a way that prevent this shaver from being able to shave them... but this is easily taken care of with 1-cleanup-swipe from a Mach 3. Overall, I&#x27;d say there is room for improvement, but under no circumstances should that prevent you from purchasing this awesome shaver.    As far as pinching, this shaver has yet to pinch me, pull my hair or cut my in anyway.     Overall, I&#x27;d say this joker is top notch. Hopefully soon, a private company will be smart enough to come out and sell the special alcohol that goes in the refill stations, so you can recycle them and spend a lot less on maintenance.</li>
    <li> Just got this shaver as a Christmas gift from my wife, and I must say it is awesome! The shave I am getting after initial use is on par with what I get with a Fusion razor. I have sensitive skin and get painful razor burn after every shave with regular razors - Mach 3, Sensor, Fusion - did not matter, shaving was a painful experience. Which is why I never shaved everyday. Just hated it. Not to mention putting on cold shaving gel early in the morning during the winters. With the razor and because of razor burn, I could not shave closely along my jawline and on my neck for fear of getting sensitivity, rashes, redness and cuts in that area. No such problem with the Pulsonic. As such, I can potentially get a better shave with an electric shaver than a razor. I am still trying the Pulsonic out, and they say it takes a good three weeks for your face to get adjusted to a new shaver. Good thing Braun provides a 30-day guarantee - though I do not anticipate taking them up on that offer. Even with a couple of shaves, I am getting as close a shave as my razor. And the razor burn is gone!    My previous experience with an electric shaver was 8 years ago, when I purchased a then-topline Norelco rotary model (6000-series, if I remember correctly).  I wanted to switch to electrics back then for the same reason I want to switch now: painful razor burn and messy shaving creams/gels. Unfortunately, the Norelco rotary system gave me lots of in-grown hairs, especially on my neck and near the jaw line. Also, the shaver never properly captured all the shaved hairs, leaving a mess on the sink for me to clean, as well having to clean the shaver itself - double work and an annoyance. Each person&#x27;s face and hair is different and they react differently to rotary versus foil electric shavers. I gave up on the Norelco because of the hassles and grudgingly went back to old fashioned razors. I guess I should have tried the Braun shavers first instead.    I had been keeping an eye out for the newBraun models, especially when they came out with the cleaning systems few years ago. Minimalist industrial design and generally built like tanks at a slightly premium price - that was my general impression of the Braun shavers. But having spent money on the Norelco and being burned, I did not risk making another purchase then and wasting more money. Well, I am glad I waited till they introduced the Pulsonic model and my wife got me the 9595.    The Pulsonic 9595 deals with nearly all the complaints I had with electric shavers, and based on my brief usage, I believe it will give me a great shave as well. The cleaning system is pure genius in my opinion: makes daily use of the shaver as simple as taking it off the cleaning station, turning on the shaver and shaving, followed by simply placing the shaver back in its resting spot and pressing the \\&quot;start cleaning\\&quot; button. The station literally takes care of everything else - from analyzing the level of cleaning needed, to cleaning and lubricating the shaver head and blades, to drying out the shaver head for the next shave and keeping the shaver fully charged. This is really a fool-proof system they have developed. Curiously, the shaver comes out smelling like lemon pledge because the alcohol bath has a lemon scent.    Only down side is that the cleaning solution needs to be replaced about once per month, but the cost is reasonable (especially with the Amazon subscription) compared to the wonderful job the cleaning system does keeping the shaver cleaned and ready every time. Nice of Braun to continue using the same cartridge design across all their models - in sharp contrast to their cousins in the Gillette division. Compared to previous Braun shavers, the Pulsonic has a lithium battery, so keeping the shaver in the cleaning base plugged in all the time is not an issue. Plus the base is smart enough to turn itself off after 10 minutes of inactivity so that it does not continuously juice the lithium battery (overnight, forexample). Like I said, Braun has developed an incredibly smart system of shaver maintenance. I am very impressed. The only complaint I have is the quality of the plastic used in the outer shell of the cleaning station - feels very cheap and fragile. Especially for the price one pays for the whole package, they should have used better materials.    The shaver itself thankfully suffers from no such faults. While it is plastic, the quality of the materials used in the body is top notch, and the shaver exudes a sturdy feel to it. And despite what the product images on the packaging and on web sites may indicate, most of the body is covered in a quality rubber like material that helps maintain a good grip while shaving. The LCD display at the bottom is nice, showing battery level and how dirty the shaver is since the last cleaning. Given the ~$40 MSRP difference between the 9595 and 9585, the extra cost is not worth it since the only difference between the two models is level of information shown for battery and cleaning needs on the shaver. However, most online stores are selling both models at almost the same prices - so might as well purchase the topline model.     The shaver has lithium ion batteries - generally believed to have better performance compared to the Ni-Cad batteries all other previous Braun shavers had. Another very nice feature is the ability to use the shaver while plugged in with the auto-detect wall charging plug, and not having to wait for the shaver to recharge before you start using it. The shaver also has a 5-minute quick charge feature.     There have been some complaints about the travel case. While I do not have the previous Braun model&#x27;s travel cases for comparison, I like the hard plastic tube that the Pulsonic can be stored in. It protects the whole shaver when it might get banged around in the luggage during travel. There is even a small space to store a cleaning brush in the case - makes sense since you will need it to clean the shaverwhen away from home and not have access to the cleaning base. People have also mentioned that there is no plastic clip to protect the shaving head, unlike other shavers that include such a thing. I don&#x27;t think it is necessary: I store the shaver in the cleaning base when at home, and in the travel case when traveling, and don&#x27;t feel the need to have a plastic clip for the head.    I can see now why the reviews on this model have been almost universally stellar - and why this shaver is sold out almost every where. Sure there are some detractors - understandable since not every man&#x27;s face and beard is the same. There is that 30-day guarantee, just in case. But I do not hesitate in recommending this shaver. Braun really as produced a great shaver - both in terms of shaving and ease of use.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for my Braun 7505.  I&#x27;ve had it for 2-1/2 months now and overall I like it.  For the record, I get heavy dark stubble which is a challenge for electrics.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. It excels at cutting neck area compared to other electrics including the 7505.&lt;br /&gt;2. Excellent battery life.&lt;br /&gt;3. It even works well if you miss a few days and have longer growth.  It doesn&#x27;t pull long hairs.&lt;br /&gt;4. No skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;5. Shaving takes less time.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. The trimmer is awful.  It is does a very poor job on nose hair and sideburns.  The trimmer location and angle make it difficult to navigate.  The 7505&#x27;s trimmer was far superior.&lt;br /&gt;2. The cleaning unit is ugly, very large, slow and very noisy while cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;3. The cleaning fluid is an expensive sales gimmick.&lt;br /&gt;4. The hygiene monitor basically just counts how many uses since cleaning.  If you manually clean the razor the hygiene monitor will still show dirty.  This is bad because the cleaning unit uses more fluid based on the hygiene monitor.  I thought I could save money by cleaning every other day, but it uses about the same amount of fluid.&lt;br /&gt;5. It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as other electrics.  It definitely looks like an electric shave.  On the 7505 I could get a very close shave if I took my time.  Extra time and several passes does not seem to improve the closeness on the 9595.&lt;br /&gt;6. The plastic travel holder is bulky.  A blade cover like the 7505 would be preferable.</li>
    <li> This is easily the best electric shaver I have ever used.  I&#x27;ve tried other foil and 3-head electrics in the past with mixed results, but none have shaved as close or as comfortably as the 9595.  I have also used 3 and 5 blade traditional and vibrating razors.  These work for a couple of weeks, but after that they start irritating the skin on my neck resulting in a rash.    I have experienced no discomfort with the 9595 and it shaves almost as close as a blade.  It certainly shaves close enough for my purposes, and I wear a suit and tie every work day.    The automatic cleaning is a God-send!  Just shave, put the unit into the base, push the cleaning button, and walk away.  Repeat next morning.  Fast, efficient, and effective.  What more could one ask for?</li>
    <li> As far as electric shavers go, this is one of the best I&#x27;ve used, if not THE best yet.  Before I got this one, I used a Norelco Spectra 8894XL for three years with almost no problems (the battery went wonky, but I got a warranty replacement.  No problems since.).  There&#x27;s nothing technically wrong with my Norelco, but I&#x27;d have to go back over my face with a dry manual razor to get the spots that it just can&#x27;t do (neck, adam&#x27;s apple, chin).  After reading some reviews of the Pulsonic, I decided to give it a go.      Upon my first use, I noticed I got a closer shave than with the Norelco, and in less time.  I still have a little difficulty with my problem areas (see above), but there is a marked improvement.  That, and the self-cleaning charger is cool.    So while no electric shaver can match a manual, the Braun Pulsonic 9595 is about as close as you&#x27;re going to get right now.  If you&#x27;re in the market for a new electric shaver, or considering switching from rotary to foil shavers (and the price doesn&#x27;t scare you away), give this one a shot.</li>
    <li> I finally replaced my Braun shaver after about 15 years.  While this one is very pricey the quality is impressive.  I get a closer shave in about 1/2 the time.  The cleaner is noisy, but not really an issue for me.</li>
    <li> I bought the Braun Pulsonic for my 83 year old husband whose skin is not as flexible as in his younger days, and he has had some minor skin cancer removals (because of his love of the sun). He likes the shaver as its shaving mechanism is easy on his skin and leaves the skin feeling smooth. He highly recommends this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased both this razor and the Norelco 1060. While I kept this razor since it shaves a bit closer than the Norelco, it feels like a oversized pickle in your hand as opposed to the Norelco 1060 which is easily maneuvered and feels great on your face. The major advantage of the Braun is the lithium ion battery which does not require a complete discharge before recharging. Further, the Braun does not travel well, given its size and weight. I purchased a cheap Norelco (8140XL) for this purpose.     In summary, this razor shaves close (although no electric razor shaves as close as a blade). The lithium ion battery is a major plus. However, its size and weight are a negative factor for those who travel a great deal.</li>
    <li> After 8yrs with my Norelco i decided to try an upgrade.  This razor was not as advertised for me.  Foil does not get as close a shave as lift &amp; cut for me.  The product might be the answer for most but again not for me.  My problem is now with Amazon.  They WILL NOT take returns on this item.  I have searched high and low on this page for that disclaimer.  Nothing was indicated when finalizing the sale either.  Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> This razor is very good. My husband has trouble getting a real close shave and this razor gets the closest he has used in a long time. Very comfortable to hold.</li>
    <li> Excellent choice for the price offered.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using it for almost 4 years and after 3 years I have changed the head.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am posting this for my boyfriend who has &amp;#34;extreme&amp;#34; sensitive skin on his face and neck. He is so happy about this shaver, which doesn&#x27;t turn his face red and irritate his face after shaving. And, the shaving is effortless with this shaver. He doesn&#x27;t need to keep going back to the missed areas. This is the best shaver he has ever had. It&#x27;s the most expensive model he looked online, but worth every penny of it.</li>
    <li> This product is actually quite astounding. It has lasted for 6 years without a problem. The battery has always lasted around 7 days, it still shaves like it did when it was brand new with replacement cartridges every 8 months or so and the cleaning solution once per week. (To preserve solution, I keep it out of the holder with the lid on it and that prevents evaporation, making each cartridge last around 4 months for me!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+ Great, close shave every day for an every-day shaver like me (or sometimes twice a day shaver)&lt;br /&gt;+ Battery lasts for week-long trips and the included case, brush, and oil are fantastic for trips to keep it clean&lt;br /&gt;+ Replacement cartridges and cleaning solution are both readily available on Amazon for cheap, easy re-ordering&lt;br /&gt;+ Never nicks, cuts, or damages face&lt;br /&gt;+ Great for trimming beard, mustache, eyebrows, sideburns, neck, or basically hair anywhere!&lt;br /&gt;+ Shave easily on the go, without any solutions&lt;br /&gt;+ Very easy to clean even just with water, but using the included oil helps maintain the blades without the solution&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;+ Rough pulling for infrequent shavers who like to go a few days in between shaving&lt;br /&gt;+ Shave poorly around facial irregularities in smoothness such as a cleft chin or moles&lt;br /&gt;+ Aggravates acne during breakouts (as most shaving will) [Though using Nivea Post-Shave Balm helps greatly and is also available on Amazon]</li>
    <li> This shaver is great. Replaced my Syncro 7540 and is far better. Admittedly, it is not a fair comparison, since I never spent the money to replace the foil or cutterblock, nor did I have a clean and charge stand for the 7540. However, the shave with the 9595 is considerably closer, smoother, and less irritating that I remember a shave with the 7540 ever being. A good bit more money than replacing the foil and cutterblock, but well worth it. I use the pop-up trimmer to keep my beard close-cropped. (What I shave is my neck, which is by far the heaviest growth.) The trimmer on the 7540 was better for this, being wider and positioned such that I could see much better to trim around my moustache; however, the trimmer on the 9595 still works fine for this. And yes, the cleaning system does make a little noise, but certainly not enough to be bothersome, unless you were to turn it on at bedtime, right next to your bedroom, when the house was otherwise still and quiet, rather than right after shaving in the morning, when it makes sense to do it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Remington and Norelco electric shavers in the past and have been disappointed with their performance compared to a blade (Gillette Fusion).  I decided to try the Braun based on the positive reviews and the shaver did not disappoint.  The Braun shaves just about as close as a blade with much less irritation.  With the use of Williams Lectric shave, I think the result is better than a blade.  The Braun clean &amp; renew system automatically tells you the level of cleaning you need.  I use the system every other shave or so.  I&#x27;ve used the Braun for about a month, and I actually enjoy shaving with it - all in all, if you&#x27;re looking for an electric razor, I highly recommend the Braun 9595.</li>
    <li> I hate shaving and did a lot of research before buying this razor.  I have a very thick beard that looks like I have not shaved by noon.  With conventional razors, I cannot shave against the grain due to my very coarse beard and sensitive skin.  I love this razor.  Since buying the razor I have gotten the closest shave ever without razor burn like most electric razors.  I shave after taking a shower, but have used it both ways.  I have found it is a bit closer when shaving after getting out of the shower, but both ways are very comfortable on your face.  Believe me when I say this thing is a hidden gem in the razor world.  My life of shaving has become 100 percent easier and it is actually enjoyable to shave now, versus the conventional way that I have used my entire life.  I hope this helps someone looking for a razor that is in my situation, coarse beard, sensitive skin, best razor ever.      The only con to the razor which I have found with all electric razors is that the area around your neck is hard to shave and may require a conventional razor about once a week even if you do a great job shaving....</li>
    <li> Ever since I saw \\&quot;How It&#x27;s Made\\&quot; on TV several weeks ago featuring the the building of the Braun Pulsonic, I&#x27;ve wanted one. But, like many, the price was daunting. For a very long time I have preferred my electric (Norelco) over a blade because the blade just takes too darn long. I only had to make one concession: the blade shaves closer. Then, just days ago, I \\&quot;bit the bullet\\&quot; so to speak, and ordered the Braun. The sheer weight of favorable reviews outweighed the price for me.    To make a long story somewhat shorter, the Braun is like no other shaver on earth. It does, indeed, rival a blade shave, and it does it eons more quickly and comfortably. On top of that, it&#x27;s built like a fine watch, and has enough bells and whistles to keep even the most jaded user happy.  It is only a small tad \\&quot;noisier\\&quot; than my Norelco, but the comparison ends there. The Braun makes the Norelco hang it&#x27;s shaver head in shame. I find myself wanting to shave more often, but the efficiency of the Braun would mean I would be shaving mostly-bare skin.    If you want the razor of all razors, forget cost and get this one. There&#x27;s no way in the world that you will end up sorry to did it.</li>
    <li> when i first started shaving, i tried braun&#x27;s best shaver at the time and didn&#x27;t care for it.  returned it and used norelco&#x27;s best shaver for over 10 years. now its time to get a new shaver. after reading the reviews on these two brands, i decided on trying braun&#x27;s pulsonic 9595.  THIS is the best shaver ever. I really like the cleaning system that goes with this product.  Thanks braun for a great product.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED ELECTRIC RAZORS FOR LAST 20 YEARS AND AT THIS POINT HAVE CONTACTED BRAUN WITH 30 DAY RETURN POLICY IF DISSATISFIED.      BRAUN ASKED ME TO TRY ANOTHER HEAD, WHICH RECEIVED AND TRIED, THE RAZOR SEEMS TO BITE AND PULL BEARD WHILE NOT GIVING ALL THAT CLOSE OF A SHAVE.     I SAID THAT I WOULD CONTINUE TO USE FOR SEVEN MORE DAYS AS REQUESTED BUT STILL HAVE DOUBTS AT THIS WRITING.     R.E. POPE</li>
    <li> I bought the latest model of Braun 9595 razor for my boyfriend&#x27;s Christmas&#x27;s present. He wanted a new electric razor so I did some investigations. If you haven&#x27;t visited Braun&#x27;s website to see their video advertisment on the 9595, check it out. It&#x27;s worth the time investment. As for the razor, there is a significant difference is smoothness. I&#x27;m really happy I purchased the Braun 9595, I love the feel of his face against my skin. The only downfall of the product is the design of liquid reservoir in the base unit. If you pack the base or tilt it, the liquid will spill. The work around is, just take the razor and not the base unit if you&#x27;re leaving out of town for a few days. Other than that small design flaw, I highly recommend this razor over the other designs available today.</li>
    <li> That Shaver is just wonderful. it doesn´t irrited the skin and let it like a \\&quot;Culito de bebe\\&quot; (baby pompis).</li>
    <li> I got the Pulsonic 9595 for Christmas this year. For the last year or so, I experimented with many types of blades, The Sensor Extra, Mach 3, the Quattro 4, etc. They all shaved well, but I did not enjoy the nicks, and inevitable irritation and the fact that I virtually HAD to shower immediately after to reduce irritation from the blades. I read lots of reviews on the Pulsonic and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.   I must say that I am impressed. It goes accross the face, neck and lip areas very smoothly. The Face/Cheek areas get sheared after just two light passes, the chin takes a few extras, the upper lip takes a little while and the neck takes the longest, but the whole process is still much more efficient over the blade useage. After a few weeks, I have learned that to catch the neck hairs and some of the odd jawbone area hairs, you have to be creative with which direction you pass the head over your face. I kind of go sideways first, then I Invert the razor (power button down) and drag it upwards to finish it off. The cleaning system is quite effortless, you just pop the razor back into the stand and it will charge the razor and allow you to clean it if you want to. The razor has a meter which keeps track of the \\&quot;hygiene\\&quot; of the razor head. I think it is actually a glorified usage timer, but at any rate, the more tick marks that are missing, the more intense the cleaning it recommends. I have cleaned mine every day on eco mode and the fluid is still on the \\&quot;high\\&quot; mark meaning I still have a lot of fluid left after 25 days of use. I also like the fact that it comes with a hard carrying case that you can put the shaver into when travelling. When travelling, you just take the plug from the base and plug it into the razor for charging. If you are only going for a day or 2, the plug would not even be needed, as the battery life would be plenty for a short trip. When travelling, you can just take the head off the unit and rinse the razor to clean. I would definately recommend this razor for someone wanting to get an electric.</li>
    <li> This is an excellant electric shaver, but is not as close as a razor.  The cleaning system is great and very convienant.  Battery life is good, I was on a 7 day trip and the battery had several more days left in it.  Overall, if you like the convienance of an electric, this is the best to buy</li>
    <li> I got this shaver for a Christmas gift from my fiance. I read all the reviews online and on Men&#x27;s Health and decided to get this instead of the Phillips.  Let me start by saying that I have VERY sensitive skin.    This razor did nothing like all the ads states. It was a rough shave. Had to go over my face numerous times and even dig the razor into the the neck to get at some whiskers.  It left my face red and bumpy and my skins burned for hours after the shave.  I ultimately returned it to Braun being very disappointed and now am searching for a new razor and looking at the new Phillips.    I would NOT recommend this shaver to anyone-especially if you have a soft sensitive face and skin.    Sorry Braun....Sorry Amazon but I am just being very honest to try and help the other consumers who may look at this.    Hope this helps......</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco Shavers for almost 40 years because they tend not to irritate the skin.  I was hesitant about using the Braun, but all the positive feedback led me to buy the Braun 9595 from Amazon.  I&#x27;ve been using the Braun 9595 for the past 6 weeks and it gives, without a doubt, the closest shave (and it does not pull or irritate the skin).    TIP - I keep the cleaning fluid in the large cleaning system casing with the system open (lifted upwards) and the lid on the cleaning liquid to prevent evaporation.  I only uncap the liquid when I am ready to clean the shaver.  I have been cleaning the Braun after every 4th shave and the fluid, after 6 weeks, is still 2/3 full.  It should last at least 2 months that way.</li>
    <li> I typically don&#x27;t write reviews, even on products that give extraordinary results.  So, you know this is an atypical review from the outset.    First, you need to know that I&#x27;ve used several Braun shave systems in the past, the most recent being the Activator 8585 system.  While that system did a fairly adequate job, there were areas under my chin and on my neck (Adam&#x27;s apple in particular) that were frequently irritated.  I&#x27;ve also tried several Norelco shavers with the floating heads and lift-and-cut cutters, but they took too much work and way too long to give an adequate shave.    After reading well over 100 reviews about many different makes and models of shavers, I decided to give the Braun Pulsonic System 9595 a try.  I was a little skeptical after reading some of the reviews, but I made up my mind to give it several weeks for my skin to adjust to the newly designed shave head, even though I had been using a Braun up until that time.    From the very first shave I knew this was a unique shaver.  It is much quieter than my previous Braun, and it&#x27;s as though I&#x27;m getting a face and neck massage as I&#x27;m shaving each morning.  As I&#x27;ve learned over the past month or so, the key to getting a consistent, close shave is holding the shaver at a 90 degree angle to the area you&#x27;re shaving.  It also helps to pull the skin tight and shave against the growth grain.    I&#x27;ve read some complaints about the trimmer but have found it to be both precise and effective.  I also like the fact that it protrudes at a 90 degree angle so you can be very precise with it in tight areas.    Overall, I am well pleased with this shaver and highly recommend it.  Not only does it give a close, smooth, irritation-free shave, it&#x27;s a pleasure to use.    Oh, I almost forgot about the lock on the shaver head.  I&#x27;ve read where some have had problems getting it to lock.  However, the key to it is to allow the head to tilt back as the lock is being pushed into the locked position.  Once it&#x27;s locked, the head is actually tilted forward, so it&#x27;s much easier to maintain a 90 degree angle in some of the hard to reach spots.  Then, to remove the lock, simply push it in the opposite direction to allow the shaver head to glide freely.    Finally, while the shaver is not inexpensive, I feel it&#x27;s well worth the investment.  I also like the cleaning system, which I use daily to keep the shaver head clean and lubricated.  I can definitely tell a difference in the closeness of the shave and how more easily it glides along the face and neck areas.    Happy shaving!    Jim</li>
    <li> There is no perfect foil razor.  This is no perfect blade razor.  All will have drawbacks.  So a 5 means it&#x27;s as good as anyone has ever done.  This razor replaced a previous Syncro and it&#x27;s a better razor.  Shave is much closer.  The thing about foils is that they do better with 2 days growth than 1.  On a daily basis, it still can&#x27;t get every spot (I have a TOUGH face).  But if I take a day off of shaving, the pulsonic makes my face as smooth as a babies butt.  Except for two spots on my neck.  Still, it&#x27;s the closest razor shave I have ever had, and it doesn&#x27;t ever irritate the skin.  The cleaning and charging system is much, much, MUCH improved over the old razor.  Fluid lasts longer, charging is now digitally controlled user transparent, and the white color of the base blends in much more with most bathrooms.  I know some men complained that the white is \\&quot;feminine\\&quot; but let&#x27;s face it, bathrooms are usually white and I imagine a major complaint about the black bases was that \\&quot;wives and girlfriends thought it was ugly.\\&quot;  Problem solved, and now they can&#x27;t complain so much about the large speakers in your living room, right? ;)  I would recommend this razor to anyone.  I keep my old razor at my vacation house now, and I used it all week and it just wasn&#x27;t the same.  I missed the new one.  I&#x27;ve never missed a razor before... :)</li>
    <li> I have always been a Norelco triple head user and enjoyed years of great shaves. With my razor being about 15 years old I was in the market for a new one. After looking for a Norelco comparable to the one I had I could not find one so I started searching for a different razor. I came up with the Braun Pulsonic 9595 and I have thoroughly enjoyed it. It gives one of the closest shaves I&#x27;ve ever had with no irritation or burning. It&#x27;s pricey but worth the money.</li>
    <li> I just upgraded from Braun&#x27;s 8595 to the 9595, even tho&#x27; I was quite happey with the older version.  All I can say about the new model is    WOW!    Much less irritation than with my previous model and I have sensitive skin.  Whether shaving with a razor or any other electric, I always have had red blotches on my throat from the irritation, and now there are none!    What?  A closer shave with no irritation?  Impossible!  Or so I would have said until this morning.... that makes it worth every penny to me.    The only quibbles I have are about the positioning of the buttons: they&#x27;re not quite as convenient as in the 8595.  Especially with the button for locking the head into an angled position; I find I have to turn off the shaver to do it.    But I&#x27;m not sweating the small stuff, and the Braun Pulsonic is still the best electric out there, bar none.</li>
    <li> I just purchased the 9595 as a replacement to my 7000 Series shaver.  While the shave from my old model was fantastic, my face is smoother after shaving with the 9595.  I had just recently replaced the foil and cutterblock on my older shaver, so I have to believe the Pulsonic System and the Gillette Blade Technology actually work as advertised. The base station&#x27;s ability to to determine how clean the shaver is is a very nice addition. I also like the fact that the base station will automatically begin charging the shaver if needed.  Finally, it was great to find that the \\&quot;Clean and Charge\\&quot; refills used for the new model are the same for the 7000 Series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a very subjective note, the overall look of the shaver and station are very polished.  Great job Braun on such an improved product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Braun 7526 shaver for about 4 years and decided to upgrade to the top of the line model 9595.  First of all the Pulsonic is easier to handle and actually feels lighter than the 7526.  As far as the shave is concerned it took less time for me to complete due to less repeat strokes needed in hard to reach areas like neck and adams apple. The hightech look is what turned me on in the first place and you won&#x27;t be disappointed with it&#x27;s digital readouts and cool blue light.  The cleaning base is also quieter than the older 7526 model with the multi colored readouts as an added bonus.  The trimmer function works well also.</li>
    <li> After 48 years of shaving with a blade I found due too medicine changes an electric razor was the possible answer. Back in 1964 a tried my  grandfathers Norelco &amp; vowed never again. But  I shopped around this month and reasearched on line and bought the Pulsonic. I am really amazed!! No pincing,burning, or rash. A close shave easy cleanup and really a no hassel issue. I am one of those that unless we have someplace to go on the weekends never shave. The past two weekends I stayed home for that purpose. No problem on Monday morning   either. Recommened Highly,</li>
    <li> I give it 5 stars BUT- still think the Braun 8000 series using ONLY the \\&quot;Activator\\&quot; replacement heads (fits all of the higher level 8000 series shavers fine) is the best way to go. I have the 8995 Complete shaver and find the Activator Replacement head gives the closes shave out of them all, hands-down.  However, the Pulsonic is a fine shaver and I am pleased. Just not as pleased as with the 8995 using the Activator replacement-that&#x27;s the way to go (and less expensive than the Pulsonic).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a die hard blade user for the last 10 years and I decided to give this thing a try after looking over the reviews. I have to say that this razor does a fantastic job, much better than I thought it would. Not quite blade close but almost. It&#x27;s a 2 minute job to shave, cleans itself, what&#x27;s not to love. I recommend 100%    --Just an update 6 months in: This razor still rocks....no problems at all, I&#x27;m only on my third cleaning tray in 6 month....so that&#x27;s pretty good. Still shaves me like new.</li>
    <li> This is probably the first bad real bad review I have ever given anything in my life. Like everyone else, I read the many 5 star reviews this latest Braun got and decided to purchase it.  I was very patient with it, used it for a solid 2 month but didnt like it at all. I have now gone back to using my older Braun, the 7526 which still works a lot better than the 9595 model for me.    -If you are not shaving daily which I never do, it can be very uncomfortable, the razor pulls hairs all the time, and simply misses a lot too.  -If you have a goatee or something you are trimming around, the way this razor is designed it makes it difficult.  -This a very loud razor, not just for cleaning which I can deal with, but when you are using it.  -Really the only nice to have was the LCD.  -I can&#x27;t believe I paid $225 for this, at least Braun gave me a refund when I shipped it back to them.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a couple of months ago, and it is definitely a really great product.  This was my first electrical razor and I have always heard that electricals do not shave as close as a blade.  When I first used it, I was really impressed by how close it shaved;  it wasn&#x27;t as close as a blade, but pretty darn close and I was happy with it.  However, now after a couple of months of allowing my face to get use to it and trying different techniques, I now think that it does shave as close as a blade (I do use Lectric pre-shaving liquid tho) and understand why people say that I have to give my face time to get use to it.  In regards to irritation, it does irritate my neck area a little bit, but not as much as a blade.  Also, one other thing that I love is the cleaning base.  It keeps the shaver fresh for day to day use.  The trimmer is pretty good too.  Overall, I am very impressed and recommend it to anyone who wants a quality electric shaver.</li>
    <li> I switched from a Gillet fusion, and at first I was not sure about this investment, but since I learned that the trick about a dry shave is to put the after shave after you shower and before you shave I am having a blast...</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I have ever owned.  You will not regret this purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver. It&#x27;s really fast and gentle on  the face. You can clean it with tap water when traveling  or the cleaning stand when home. I use the fast cleaning  feature a lot (takes only 25 seconds). Overall I get a very  close shave without any skin rash or irritation. It&#x27;s the  best shaver I&#x27;ve had so far.</li>
    <li> This razor does indeed give the closest most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had from an electric razor. The cleaning system makes it easy to tell what condition the razor is in and what you need to do to maintain it.</li>
    <li> The pulsonic 9595 is a great shaver it really gives a close and confortable shave, body is shaped to fit hand perfectly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used rotary shavers, which did the job. This razor does the job but takes longer and is louder. Paying for the auto clean is a waste of money it takes a few minutes to do it yourself.</li>
    <li> I have an average beard, and this razor did a great job on my actual face.  The problem was that it just wouldn&#x27;t pick up the hairs under my jaw and on my neck, even after a month.  I finally returned the razor to Braun since I kept having to shave with a regular razor afterwards anyway.  Most people seem to have a positive experience, so I would still recommend others try it.  I was just one of the few for which it didn&#x27;t work so well.</li>
    <li> This shaver is as close on most areas as when I use my Gillette Fusion Power (5 blades). There are a few areas on my neck that the hairs lay so close to the skin, it takes probably five strokes, or a twisting action to get it close. But, there is NO discomfort with the Braun Pulsonic as there is with a blade. Some people say the cleaning system is not as good as the razor, being expensive, noisy, etc. I agree that it is rather noisy, but if you think about the ease of use factor, it&#x27;s not that expensive. The cleaning system cleans, lubricates, and dries the shaver, and very well at that. You don&#x27;t have to worry about leaving it open to dry after rinsing it clean, or lubricating it once a week, since the water doesn&#x27;t lubricate it. The solution has a semi-pleasant, citrus smell. The unit remembers how much it&#x27;s been run since the last cleaning, and the base adjusts the cleaning cycle to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;easy to use&lt;br /&gt;comfortable on your face&lt;br /&gt;ergonomical (for me anyway)&lt;br /&gt;close (let your face get used to it for a while before you judge)&lt;br /&gt;built very solid&lt;br /&gt;cartridges of solution make for easy changing (no bottles to mess with)&lt;br /&gt;base is reasonably sized, especially compared to a cleaning base for a rotary shaver, which doesn&#x27;t heat dry it&lt;br /&gt;has a lcd to remind you when to change the foil and cutter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning cycles are reasonably noisy&lt;br /&gt;cleaning cartridges represent additional expense (although only about $5.50 a cartridge, which should last almost two months if you clean every other shave, {get it down so there&#x27;s two bars left in the hygiene meter, so it&#x27;ll stay on the normal clean cycle.})&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;I paid $130 two years ago for a self cleaning rotary shaver. this is not even twice the price, and is MUCH more than twice as good. I will never go back to a rotary. Reasonably priced, although it could be a little cheaper, maybe around $180 would be the price at which I wouldn&#x27;t go with ANYTHING else.</li>
    <li> My older Braun 8595 needed $30 worth of new cutting blades and foils, so being a typical dumb male, I decided to buy a new $215 Braun 9595 instead.    Well, turns out that the 9595 provides the exact same shave quality as the 8595, but is a bit noisier, with somewhat lower build quality, and with a goofier LCD display than the 8595 has.    And the 9595&#x27;s packaging is an embarrassment -- it reminds me of Apple&#x27;s original iPod packaging, simply a terrible waste of paper and plastic.    The 9595&#x27;s \\&quot;Pulsonic\\&quot; quality claims are meaningless. Believe me, it doesn&#x27;t provide any better or closer shave than its predecessor, the 8595. I was foolish to purchase it.    Its only improvement seems to be a \\&quot;quick clean\\&quot; setting on the cleaning base -- which seems to be the normal \\&quot;economical clean\\&quot; without the drying cycle. Big deal!    Braun really relied on its marketing department for this 9595 design, instead of its engineering department. Bad Braun!! Buy the 8595 instead, save $100!! Don&#x27;t get &#x27;suckered&#x27; by Braun&#x27;s advertising.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this a one-star due to the fact that I didn&#x27;t like it enough to return it.  Here are some of the positives/negatives to help you decide:    Positive:    1.  Good, fast shave on hairs all going in one direction (the hairs on my neck swirl a bit and it shaved this very poorly because you have to hit the hairs at the correct upstream angle).    2. Unit does not get hot while working    3. Good battery life (true of all new electrics)    4. Head swivels so it is easy to keep unit in contact with face      Negatives:    1.  HUGE footprint of the cleaning/recharging unit--it is so large that unless you have a 200 sq foot bathroom with tons of counter space, you will not want it on your counter.     2.  No better shave than any other norelco or braun, which can be purchased at a significantly lower price    3.  Pulsonic in my opinion is a gimmick--probably does nothing to improve the shave    4.  Cleaning solution is expensive--one of the major advantages (besides comfort) of an electric is the cost over time, but with having to buy the cleaning solution, this is eliminated, plus it is one more \\&quot;thing\\&quot; to buy.  I&#x27;ve used norelco and braun and have just rinsed them in the sink which is sufficient--my current norelco is over 5 yrs old.  Why does a shaver have to be perfectly clean??  I think a quick rinse is fine with me.     5.  The small cut hairs fall all over the counter...as opposed to my norelco where most of the hairs are inside the unit until I rinse them out. So the Braun was much messier.</li>
    <li> Great product great shave.  I would recomend replacing the cleaning fluid and foil shaver heads every other month instead of every third month.  Seems to work better that way.</li>
    <li> I have owned electric shavers on and off over the years.  Usually, I just fall back to using the blade as the electric shaver gets frustrating to use.  With this Braun, I am having a very good experience and much better than any electric shaver I have used in the past.  So far, no desire to go back to blade because of frustrations of dealing with an bad electric razor.  This Braun was expensive, but worth the cost from a convenience and quality of shave stand point.  The only question I have is long term use - will I feel the same 12-24 months from now.    Here are some key things to keep in mind if you are going to buy it or you have it, to get the most of of it:    -Keep it clean.  The automatic cleaner makes a huge difference.  I find if I clean it every 2-3 days with the auto-cleaner and the blue liquid it comes with, my shave is 10 times better.  Keeping it clean is key.    -Although not always needed, Electroshave splashed on the faces helps the shave go a bit smoother.  Also, if you have not shaved in a few days, Electroshave or something like it + this Braun makes shaving a piece of cake.    -Give it a few weeks for your face to get used to the electric shaver.  It gets easier and better each week you use it.  Also, they shave will never be as close as a razer, but this Braun gives you a shave that looks very good and very smooth.    -The convenience of this Braun makes it all worth it when compared to the normal cream and razor.  For me, the trade offs are now worth it since the Braun is the first electric to give me a great shave.</li>
    <li> Over the years, I have owned several electric shavers from all of the major companies.  Unfortunately, I was always a little disappointed in the product&#x27;s performance.   Thankfully, that is not the case this time.  This shaver is amazing.  It does a fantastic job.  I also love the self cleaning feature which also works surprisingly  well and keeps the the hair form going everywhere when you are trying to clean the shaver.  In fact, there is really no need to manually the shaver anymore.  All you have to do is place the shaver in the base and it does all the work for you.      The quality  of the shave and the added bonus of automatic cleaning make this item a must have.  So, please do not be scared away by the higher price.  If you are in the market for an electric shaver, give this item some serious consideration. You will be glad you did.</li>
    <li> I have gone through three different Braun 7526 shavers over the past seven years, that said, I recently purchased a 9595 and Braun has made it more difficult to use the shaver without the cleaning system.  I hardly used the cleaning system on the 7526, it was too much of a hassle not to mention not cost-efficient.  On the 9595, Braun suggests you can use hot water and some soap to manually clean the shaver.  However, Braun has made it difficult to clean with a brush because on the 9595 unlike the 7526, the foil and cutterblock are connected, so it&#x27;s impossible to clean the cutterblock with the supplied brush.  Add to that the annoying \\&quot;hygiene\\&quot; meter on the bottom of the shaver that keeps blinking \\&quot;-\\&quot; to signify low hygiene even after I have used soap and water to clean the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line for me is the shaver works better than the 7526, but the cleaning system is very annoying.  Braun is banking on customers using the cleaning system and purchasing refills, and has created the product in a way that it becomes somewhat of a hassle to clean manually.  You can still clean manually, but from my experience it won&#x27;t be as clean as it would have been had the cutterblock and foil not been attached (which would allow for brush cleaning).  And yes, I followed all the directions and ran the water the way the instructions said, with the shaver on, but the low hygiene sign keeps blinking.  I am seriously considering returning the shaver because I don&#x27;t need the cleaning system and because of the way Braun has created the product to dissuade people from manual cleaning.  It&#x27;s not even likely Braun will release a 9595 without the cleaning system, because the inherent problem in my opinion is the foil and cutterblock being attached, thus preventing brush cleaning of each segment of the cutterblock.</li>
    <li> I have used Braun for over 35 years but this product coming out at 21st Century is the WORST! I am very disappointed with this product which comes with a big price tag. I have a sensitive skin and after each use my skin gets extremely irritated and bumpy that I have to apply Hydrocortisone cream to soothe it. The trimmer is worthless and does not do the job. I have decided to go back to razors because I can shave with one stroke and I do not have to pass the shaver on and on many times and burn my skin with the heat. Adding salt to injury I have to use the Braun liquid to clean it each time with additional cost. I would NOT recommend this shaver to anyone. If you are able to test it before buying do it otherwise, either buy a cheaper one or just use the razor.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my boyfriend for Christmas.  He absolutely loves it.  There is one thing that is different and that is the light on the shaver is very bright.  So bright, we keep the bathroom door shut otherwise we would get no sleep.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Fantastic shave.  Easy to use, smooth and quiet.  Only down side is that it is a clean-aholic.  Cleans after every use, so leave it off the charger between uses if you don&#x27;t want to run the clean cycle every time... otherwise, it is great!</li>
    <li> This product lives up to it&#x27;s billing.  It took two to three weeks for my face to adapt to the Braun from a blade.  Since then I have been getting shaves as close as any blade and more comfortable.  Three or four minutes for a shave, put it back in the cleaning/charging stand and it is ready to go the next time.  The razor is more expensive than most, but worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I received my product in a timely manner, just as described and at the agreed upon price. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> I was just a little disappointed with the results as I have a very tough beard. Been shaving with Norelco/Phillips razors about all my life, and this razor just barley beats these, I also thought the price was a bit steep but the razor is well very well made, hope it last as long as they claim.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with the Braun Syncro 7680, and can honestly tell you that it&#x27;s provided the best shave ever.  I decided to give myself an upgrade this past Christmas to the new 7 series Pulsonic expecting that the new shaver would provide an even better shave- especially for the hefty price tag.  The new system seems to shave a bit quicker, but would irritate a lot more and shave no where near as close.  I could go two days with the old shaver before \\&quot;needing\\&quot; to shave again.  With the new Pulsonic, I would need to shave everyday- bummer.  After hoping for the best and allowing my face to adjust for 4 weeks, nothing changed.  What a disappointment- I&#x27;ve since returned the shaver under the 60 day money back guarantee.  I&#x27;m sticking with my old Braun- the grass isn&#x27;t always greener...</li>
    <li> Over the years I have tried numerous electric shavers and was always disappointed that they didn&#x27;t come close to shaving with a wet razor. This Braun Pulsonic razor is the first that shaves almost as closely as a wet razor. It is comfortable in your hand, not as loud as some other razors, and you can lock the moving head to get into places like under your nose. I was a little sceptical of the cleaning accessory but that actually seems to work really well too. Overall, I am very happy with this razor.</li>
    <li> He was crazy about his last one and just thinking of replacing it when he saw a television piece on Braun and this newest addition to their line. Knowing he&#x27;d gotten 8 good years out of the first Braun, we came to terms with the price fairly quickly and ordered this for him. My husband raves about this Braun and he&#x27;s had it almost a year now. He&#x27;ll tell anyone who&#x27;ll listen that it is the best shaving experience, best technology in the world. He has actually had skeptical friends and family members sit down while HE shaved them with it, all the while raving of how incredible it is. Scarey I know, but perfectly true and they&#x27;ve all loved the results. He says he gets a smoother shave with it and the auto cleaning feature is wonderful as well as the flip out trimmer. If you&#x27;re looking to buy an electric shaver, this is the one to get. You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I have never found an electric razor that works that well,a close shave,  and this one is not that much different.  The clean and recharge system it great.</li>
    <li> I have used Braun electric shavers for over ten years.  I recently upgraded my old Braun Series 5 shaver to the Braun Series 7 and have been extremely pleased with the performance of the new shaver.  The Series 7 provides an extremely close shave and is much quieter than the other Braun models.  I have tried other brands of electic shavers and nothing comes close to this one.  I recommend it highly.  Yes, it is an investment but when you consider that I had my last Braun shaver for 8 years without a problem, the cost is neglible when you consider the recurring cost of purchasing disposable razors and shaving cream.</li>
    <li> This shaver is just ridiculous.  I&#x27;d say it gets 95% as close as a straight blade and it doesn&#x27;t even feel like you&#x27;re shaving!  It just glides right across your face like a spoon.  It&#x27;s really amazing.  I bought this to replace my 8 year old Braun 7680 Clean &amp; Renew.  I used that one daily for the past 8 years and it still works like new, I just wanted a change (this is truly a testament to Braun&#x27;s craftsmanship and durability).  I&#x27;m happy that Braun hasn&#x27;t decided to cut costs on their products by cheapening the brand and outsourcing to China like all American manufacturers do.  This is made in Germany and you can tell.  It just exudes class.  This is probably one reason for the high price, but it&#x27;s worth it.  I&#x27;d rather pay higher prices for quality goods that will last than something cheap that will either break down or need to be replaced in a year.  People complain about the price, but when you take into consideration how long these things last, the price really is not that much.  A $50 shaver every two years is more costly than a $220 shaver every 10 years.  In any case, putting costs aside, this shaver has to be the best on the market.  It is a huge upgrade from Braun&#x27;s previous flagship, the old Series 7.  Don&#x27;t be hesitant to buy this thing, it&#x27;s worth its weight in gold.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000Q6SU3C Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic  Shaver]]  I was reluctant to spend the money they wanted for this shaver, but it was worth it. I&#x27;m thouroughly satisfied with this one. It cuts better than the Remington&#x27;s that I&#x27;ve been using for many years, and I really like using a clean shaver every time I use the automatic cleaning feature. This shaver seems to be built to last!</li>
    <li> I was tired of cutting myself with blades, but skeptical about the shave of an electric.  I finally convinced myself to by the 790.  WOW is all I can say!  After a few shaves my skin adjusted and now I&#x27;m getting as close of a shave as an electric can give, but it definitely exceeds my standards.  Just for good measure I went over my face with a blade to see how close the 790 gets, and I cant even see any hairs in the blade.  I&#x27;ve now learned that you can get a good shave with an electric, you just have to be willing to spend money on a top of the line model.  It&#x27;s my first braun shaver and will not be my last!</li>
    <li> I was sketical at 1st - blade razor user for many years.  Still not as good as blade, but very convenient.  I would say it is 80% as close a shave as my Gillette.  I still \\&quot;clean up\\&quot; with the blade after using the electric in hard to shave areas, but would not switch back to just blade.  Cut shaving time by 40%.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000Q6SU3C Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic  Shaver]]  This is by far the best razor I have ever owned in my 50 + years of shaving. It is a precision instrument in every way.  I could not be any better.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to replace a 5 year old Braun model.  Overall, I have been very pleased with the quality and performance of every Braun product that I have owned and this shaver is no exception.  Though it takes a day or two to get used to, it performs very well and delivers an amazingly close and comfortable shave.  In my opinion, it performs much better than my previous Braun shaver and is much less irritating to my skin.  All in all, I think this is an excellent product and have not found any fault with it.  I hope that it gives me 5 excellent years like my last Braun.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, having bought one of the cheaper Braun series and been disappointed. I stayed skeptical despite all of the reviews. But while this razor is not perfect (like all electrics, it takes some time on the neck, etc.), it IS a great shave. Nice to use, and the vibrating technology really works. Almost look forward to shaving every morning. I also thought the cleaning system was a total crock gimmick, and it is still annoying that it chooses whether to do eco/regular/or intensive, but I&#x27;ve grown to like it. Call me a convert. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with Braun shavers since highschool (almost 20 years). This shaver is my third shaver now. My first Braun shaver lasted over 10 years and it was when I couldn&#x27;t find replacement cutters and screens that I bought a Syncro shaver. The Syncro had lasted about seven years for me until just recently in which I had problems with charging the unit in the cleaning base. I decided it was time to buy a new shaver instead of trying to fix the one I had. I bought the 790 with high expectations since I have been happy with my Syncro. The new shaver for me performs the same as my old shaver. I have always had problems with shaving neck hair but I just cleaned up my neck with a razor. I thought having the pulsating head on the 790 would fix this problem but it has not. I have tried other shavers in the past and they would nick up my neck and I have been very happy with Braun&#x27;s self cleaning system. Overall I&#x27;m happy with my new shaver but I had hopes that it would perform better than my old Syncro. If price is a concern, you may want to look at the lower tier shaver that doesn&#x27;t having the pulsating head. I think you will get the same performace without spending the extra money.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the item.  Best electric shaver I&#x27;ve own.  Good quality, close shave, excellent design and features. Automatic cleaning feature is outstanding!  Still can&#x27;t beat the blade but for the money and convenience is the best unit you can buy.</li>
    <li> Purchased this electric shaver for my 18 year old son about 2 1/2 years ago.  He uses it everyday except for no shave November. He loves it and it shaves today as well as it did the first day. Looks and works today as it did when it was new. Comes with a handy travel case.  It was well worth the money, highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Originally I had a much older Braun 7000 series (about 8 years old) that quit on me, so I decided to go with the Braun 790cc.  I&#x27;ve used it now for about a month, and I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with the razor.  I used a cheap Panasonic razor (the ES4026NC) while I was waiting for replacement razor, and found it irritated my skin.      I like this model, as the older Braun did not have the option to manually clean the razor with warm water and soap.  Unfortunately the hygiene meter doesn&#x27;t change; I suppose you have to manually reset the device.  The self-cleaning station seems to only last for about 10 cleanings, so that can get a little pricey if use the station frequently.    Overall, I like the razor very much, and it&#x27;s worth it&#x27;s high price.  Only complaint is the processing time it took Amazon to ship the razor (had to wait for over a week before it was even shipped), so if you wanted overnight or next day - that&#x27;s so not you.  Amazon&#x27;s price did make up for the long lead time, so I&#x27;m a bit forgiving about that.</li>
    <li> Amason ask for a review of the Braun Series 7-790cc pulsonic shaver and I don&#x27;t usually respond to such request but this product is so good I feel guilty for having not written about it before.  I was a former Brun user (eight years) and past my excellent older model on to my son with high praise ... I fell for the hype about another brands razor and spent $240+ only to be greatly disappointed that it could not trim accurate lines along a beard, nor shave the hair on my neck ... after sixty days I tossed the \\&quot;new\\&quot; (I didn&#x27;t pass on the inferior razor) and bought the series 7 and omg first time out it was actually as smooth as a straight edge shave ... no tugging, no pulling, no burn ... ok, so it was good once but how would it hold up?  I&#x27;m now in about two months and honestly it is the best product I have ever bought.  I thought my last Braun was good but this is GOLD ... my son is getting a new 790cc for Christmas, unless of course he reads this recommendation before then.  They aren&#x27;t cheap, but you definately get value for your dollars.</li>
    <li> It comes with a fancy nice box, lot&#x27;s of accessories and a travel box for the shaver. My bf loves it and the nice thing is the automatic cleaning option. You can choose when to clean it and it will shut it off automatically. There is an indicator showing how clean your shaver is and you can decide when to clean it. Apparently according to him the shaving is nice, close and clean shave, but you really have to get used to the pulsonic thing and the rotating shaver. The cons is still the noise that it makes. It&#x27;s really loud when the shaver is working including during cleaning.</li>
    <li> After reading some of the reviews I got excited and started to think this might be the holy grail of electric shavers. That wonderful piece of machinery that will free me from the shackles of the morning showers necessary to shave with a blade. Alas, I was mislead. The instructions tell me to give my face 2-3 weeks to get used to the electric shaver, but I surmise that this guideline is really meant to close the door to product returns as I am now stuck with this $220 knight in shining armor that slays dragons like a peasant boy. My face is no smoother than it was with any other electric shaver and have a 5pm shadow by 2pm. Do yourself a favor and spend $60 or less for something cheap if you&#x27;re going to use an electric shaver. I&#x27;m going back to morning showers and a blade.</li>
    <li> Ok, so after reading the reviews of others let me summarize. All but the occasional outlier agree that this is an excellent razor. The dispute largely comes from the majority who are completely pleased with their purchase, and a significant minority who think the razor is overpriced. I&#x27;m with the minority. As to the quality issue--no issue there. Excellent razor, smoother and a bit quicker in shave than my old Remington Titanium 5520, probably a bit closer shaver, too. Perhaps it is most accurate to focus on the \\&quot;quicker\\&quot; rather than \\&quot;closer.\\&quot; That is, it gets to where it&#x27;s going a LITTLE faster than my older, cheaper shaver. However (updating this review after months of use, when the blades are no longer quite as new...), areas that the Remington was not perfect on, the Braun doesn&#x27;t do significantly better either. That&#x27;s my face-- and that&#x27;s the state of electric razor technology. There&#x27;s been no magic bullet. This is not an amazing new technology, Braun&#x27;s marketing success with \\&quot;pulsonic\\&quot; notwithstanding. If you now feel compelled to touch up on important days with a blade--you still will after buying this. Another performance related issue deserves comment--the oft-mentioned noise issue. I don&#x27;t get that complaint. This is quieter than the Remington, nothing more than a significant hum. On the whole I&#x27;m very pleased with it. But all that said--is it worth the price? That&#x27;s the real issue. I got this at the discounted price, including cleaning base system, of $219 and free shipping. The Remington, which used to be pricier, is available now for about $50 these days. Is the Braun 400%+ better? Not hardly. Over four times the price (even with new discounts) and not even 50% better is more like it. And 50% would be high. Play with the math, but you get the idea: the difference is evolutionary, not revolutionary, and those who wax poetic about getting what you pay for are perhaps overly defensive over their spending habits. :) This is an improvement over the lower endrazors--but neither indispensable nor magical. (A lot of the price hike goes to bells and whistles, of course. Having a \\&quot;hygiene meter\\&quot; hardly gives you a closer shave, for instance.) My ultimate decision: keep it. It&#x27;s classy and excellent. It is used every day. And will last years. Under those circumstances, spending extra for some modest improvement is worth it to me as the cost is amortized by both frequency of use and the time it is likely to last.  A lot of that decision to keep it is centered around inertia, however. It is a hassle to send it back and start looking again, and I might be no happier in Round 2. It is not worth the effort for the $75 or whatever that I perhaps overpaid. I probably won&#x27;t buy a similarly priced model next time around. You&#x27;ll be pleased. You&#x27;ll see some improvement (smoothness, in particular). But as with most luxury products, when you troll for \\&quot;best ofs,\\&quot; the hideous price spike rarely makes you think you are getting value for the extra money, even if it is better.</li>
    <li> This is my first shaver and i definitely love this product. The problem is, no matter how hard i try i cannot get a clean shave around my neck region, especially the side lower neck regions. Apart from that you will never find a difference from blade in the other regions. Another set back is the cleaning process. Once you shave, the hygiene indicator comes down and no matter how hard you clean with water ( which they say we can do ) it will never show complete hydiene bar. The hygiene bar is complete only when you use the cleaning system which is very odd. If you leave the cleaning catride in the system, you will not be able to use it more than twice or thrice since all the liquid will evaporate. For this reason, you will have to pull the cleaning catridge from the cleaning system and put the lid back on every time. So, do not throw the small lid for the cleaning catridges. Though it works fine, personally i feel the cleaning system is very expensive as three catridges cost you around 20 dollars. You can get cheaper ones (other than Braun) which would cost you 50 bucks for a 12 pack. I am still adapting to an electronic shaver and hope this review is helpful. Overall the shaver is expensive but worth every penny if something is done to the cleaning system or if the cleaning liquids are a bit cheaper.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day.  He has had many brands of shavers over the years, but we have never spent the money for a shaver of this qualitity.  I&#x27;m sure if we added all the costs together for all of the other shavers that we would have exceeded the cost of this Braun.  The first time that he used it he remarked what a great shave he received.  The old quote that you only get what you pay for is really true in this case.  I would highly recommend this shaver,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned two other Braun shavers.  The \\&quot;pulsonic\\&quot; feature is great.   Only regret is that the Germans also have outsourced manufacturing to China. Hopefully this product holds up.</li>
    <li> I have always hate hate HATED shaving.  I have used every new razor to hit the market in the hopes of finding a close comfortable shave that wouldn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  Every few years I would try the hot new electric shaver (Panasonic, Braun, Norelco) and be sorely disappointed, literally. I had decided that electrics are junk.  I would always buy the latest and greatest razors on the market as soon as they came out hoping against hope that I could use them comfortably every day.  I have used the Gillette Sensor, Mach Three (Power), Schick Quattro, and now the Gillette Fusion (power).  I also use a very high quality shaving cream and a shaving brush.  I also shave 99% of the time in the shower.  Even with all of this, I couldn&#x27;t shave every day without irritating my face terribly.  I would avoid shaving at all costs and I would look like a vagrant!    After seeing a show about how this razor is made and all of the technology that went in to it, I decided to give it a try.    All I can say is WOW!  My first shave with this shaver was smooth and comfortable.  Everyone (including the Braun instruction booklet) says that it will take 2-3 weeks of using it for your face to adjust, but even from the first shave I love this shaver.  It is like no other shaver I have ever used.  The ultrasonic pulses make the experience really smooth, and the foil feels great against my skin.  Add in the fact that it cleans itself, and this thing is a modern miracle.  I can actually shave every day in comfort.    Now for the big question, does it shave as close as a blade?  The answer is that it depends on the blade.  It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as my fusion power with my good shave cream and brush in the shower.  But it does shave as close as ANY 2 bladed razor out there and possibly as close as the Mach 3.  Basically if you shave very close with a razor and wait about 1/2 hour and feel your face, that is how close this shaver shaves (and that is pretty darn close).  And my face hasn&#x27;t even adjusted yet.  I&#x27;ll try to update this review after 3 weeks, but I am totally happy with it right now, it can only get better as my face adjusts.    This shaver is DEFINITELY worth every penny.  Don&#x27;t skimp on a lower model to save a few bucks, you&#x27;ll be happy you didn&#x27;t.  That said, I don&#x27;t know how the top of the line models from Norelco or Panasonic are... They are probably very good too, but I cannot imagine that they could be any better.    UPDATE 2/23/10:    I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for 1.5 months now and I have to say I love it more than I did when I first wrote this review.    The shaver produces a close comfortable shave right out of the box the first time you use it, but after about a month, is is even better.  From what I understand that is because your face adjusts.  Whatever the reason, I am getting the absolute best shaves of my life, with little or no irritation!!    I have thrown out all of my old razors and shave cream.  I will NEVER go back to a blade!    I am amazed to actually be saying this, but this shaver is that good.    I also recommend using \\&quot;Lectric Shave\\&quot; pre-shave.    I used to loathe shaving and avoid it at all costs, now I look forward to shaving.    I cannot recommend this shaver enough.</li>
    <li> Purchased june 15 2009. Battery shot already, have to shave with cord attached. E-mailed company, no reply.</li>
    <li> I replaced my Braun 8585 with this new model, and I am very satisfied with my purchase.  I&#x27;ve been using Braun foil shavers for the last twenty years (with a few experiments with other types of electrics that simply don&#x27;t work as well) including two other models of the self cleaning variety.  This one is by far the best.  The shave is very, very close, even compared to the excellent 8585.  The cleaning/charging base, which is white, also fits my bathroom much better than the prior models, which had a grey base.  The only real negative I can find with this model is that the travel case that comes with it is really a piece of garbage compared to previous models of Braun shavers (it&#x27;s clear plastic and just plain ugly and cheap.)  However, this is probably the best electric shaver that you can buy right now.</li>
    <li> The Braun Series 7 - 790 cc pulsonic shaver does a GREAT job. I have a very tough beard and especially have a hard time shaving on my jaw line. This unit shaves me VERY close and does it very quickly. I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of Braun&#x27;s over the last 20 years, but this is by far the best one.  So smooth and what a great shave.</li>
    <li> After reading tons of reviews (majority good)I bought this for my husband for his birthday.  He&#x27;s in the military so he shaves every day.  I had high hopes that this would be the answer to outrageously priced razor cartridges, but I&#x27;m sorry to say that it wasn&#x27;t. :(  It looks beautiful...no complaints about the design or noise level, it just doesn&#x27;t give him a close enough shave.  He has given it a few weeks, as the product packaging suggests, but it&#x27;s no better than before.  I will be looking into returning it to the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Norelco user for most of my 30 years of electric shaving. I&#x27;ve tried others,Grundig, Hitachi and an earlier low end Braun but always went back to Norelco due to ease of shave and battery life. Recently my 9190XL was in need of parts and it seemed like the Norelco wasn&#x27;t shaving was well as it used to (even with new cutters). I started looking into others again. I was attracted to the idea of the cleaning station as getting them cleaned and lubed properly was a chore. So I purchased this 790cc since Braun has a 60 refund policy. I&#x27;ve been using it for three weeks now and simply love it. At first it shaved as well as my 9190XL then it just got better as my skin adjusted and maybe I learned how to use it. The cleaning station does what it is supposed to do and it&#x27;s always clean, charged and ready to go. I was concerned about a constant charge ruing the battery but I read on Braun website that the battery is discharged and recharged during cleaning cycle in essence conditioning the battery. I can only assume and hope that this is the case. Maybe my beard has changed as rotary shavers have always worked better for me than foil however either this machine has changed this or it&#x27;s me. In either case, I&#x27;m happy with it and recommend you give it a try. It may not work as well for you but worth looking into as long as Braun is willing to take it back.</li>
    <li> I have owned two earlier version Braun electric shavers and liked them both.  This one offers a good shave and less concern for nicking and rawness on the face.  I have only had it a few weeks but it is working fine.  I always buy my shavers in pairs.  I travel so much that I keep one in my suitcase all the time for traveling.  This system is more expensive but has worked fine and provides a backup should I need it - which I haven&#x27;t needed to date.</li>
    <li> My first electric shaver and have mixed feelings. It doesn&#x27;t do a great job of cutting under my chin until the 20th or more time of going over the hair. When it does finally cut the hair it is extremely close and comfortable. Recommended if you already use and enjoy electric shavers. New buyers try something less expensive.</li>
    <li> The hard case is excellent idea that comes with the unit,also the batteries last longer that previouse products,the shaving i think is the same .</li>
    <li> I have had the Braun shaver for 16 months and believe it is the best electric shaver I have ever used.  I have read discussions about washing your face, not washing, etc.  I find that washing the night before and using a pre-shave (mennen afta works best for me) produces the best results.  I always have some problem with missed hairs, but with this shaver they are at the minimum.  Also, I am still on the first set of shaver heads.  I clean mine twice a week, but remove cassette and blow clean after each shave.</li>
    <li> OK - I&#x27;ve been shaving for, let&#x27;s see now - - - FIFTY-one years!  And, always hopeful, I&#x27;ve tried numerous electric shavers along the way - including the ones with three spinning blades and another Braun model - - but none of them has ever come anywhere near \\&quot;blade close\\&quot;.  THIS ONE DOES!!  IMHO - this is the ONLY one that does.    From the first day, I&#x27;ve been delighted!  I may have a little more stubble at the end of the day - - but I leave in the morning with a smooth face!  And I can have an extra 5-10 minutes to enjoy my coffee before I leave.  I would have saved over TWO MONTHS of my time if I&#x27;d had this saver for the last 51 years!!  Now, my only problem is figuring out what to do with the left over cartridges I have for my blade razor.  (I HATE throwing things out unused.)    This may be on the \\&quot;expensive\\&quot; side - - but it&#x27;s also way out on the \\&quot;worth it\\&quot; side!  Don&#x27;t even THINK about alternatives.</li>
    <li> I have actually purchased two of these in the past two years, and here are my summary conclusions:&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Very close shave, the best of any electric to date&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The first unit had a nasty habit of turning my face blue after use...the center foil is blue, and it consistently bled onto my skin meaning I always had to use it pre-shower.&lt;br /&gt;If you let your beard get longer, it will pull some of the hairs out rather than cut (painful).  Lesson learned, make sure to shave with it every few days minimum.&lt;br /&gt;The tradeoff for being close is that this is the first and only electric that ever cut me or left painful skin abrasions.  It was a consistent problem shaving right under my nose, trying to get those highest whiskers - it either cut or abraded there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the above, I tossed it after 6 months and bought a panasonic, which started leaking oil everywhere.  So, I bought another Bruan Pulsonic...except this second unit started leaking oil like a sieve after one month.  I am not up for shaving and having lubricating oil all over my face, so I am tossing this one and won&#x27;t be coming back to the Pulsonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, got a few nice shaves but overall felt it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> My third Braun. Well made, excellent shave.</li>
    <li> The good:  - This shaver is relatively quiet.  - The cleaning/charging system is very nice.    The bad:  - The price ($186.00). With a high price comes high expectations.  - The shave. On my face, the shave is no better than the shave I got from my Remington MS 280 (about $40.00). It didn&#x27;t seem like the \\&quot;pulsonic\\&quot; feature helped at all. On my neck, there were spots that I just could not get. I tried shaving in all sorts of directions, but I just could not get all of my neck closely shaved. Generally, it was good enough, but if I wanted to get a really close shave on my neck, I had to bust out the Remington. I saved the best for last: This shaver pulled my hairs. Talk about frustrating and painful. This thing won&#x27;t be pulling my hairs anymore since I smashed it against the sink in frustration ... embarrassing, I know. But, at least I won&#x27;t be using this shaver anymore.</li>
    <li> Bought new Braun series 7 - 790 cc lasted 45 days . The shave wasok but not the best but when it quit working I followed directions and sent it back and never heard another word from them.Try and call some one from Braun and all you get is pre recorded messages no people!and no satifaction with poor customer reliabilty. will not buy again that is even if I get my money back. poor poor beware they do not care about you.</li>
    <li> Having been an exclusive Braun user since 1963 (47 years) and having had the earlier version of this shaver I am sad to say that I am deeply disappointed. It shaves okay most of the time, but the cutter for trimming is difficult to open (sometimes requiring two hands). Worse than that is the \\&quot;pulling\\&quot;of hairs. OUCH! Previous shavers didn&#x27;t do that and I hardly need to prove that I am using it correctly after 47 years with Braun and being on my second Pulsonic. (The first one wouldn&#x27;t charge. I hope that you send a copy of this to Braun.</li>
    <li> Do not buy a Braun Razor until you read this. I owned a series 3 razor that never worked before buying the series 7. My series 3 would not charge in the stand so I contacted Braun who had me send it in to a service center. After paying shipping and insurance twice my razor still never worked. Frustrated I gave up on it and began using a handheld razor. My wife was kind enough to purchase a series 7 for me at a cost of $220.00. Though I had bad luck with Braun I gave it a try. It was a really nice razor that did a decent job of shaving. But after only 4 months it stopped working completely. I contacted Braun who again had me send it to a service center. After paying shipping and insurance my razor returned still not functioning. I contacted Braun who said I need to send it in again and that they could do nothing for me. How many times do I have to send a razor into a service center to get one that works more than 4 months. After insurance, shippin and all those expensive cartridges I have had to waste each time I send it in, I have spent over $400 to still have a Braun razor that does not work. If I had written a review within 2 months of getting this razor, as most of the reviewers of this product probably did, I would have given it 4-5 stars. But Braun products just don&#x27;t work, and their customoer service is horrible. Do yourself a favor and go with a different company because you will get this product and be happy for a few months but then the frustration begins.</li>
    <li> I bought this very expensive [[ASIN:B000Q6SU3C Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic  Shaver]] because of reviews like \\&quot;closest thing to a blade\\&quot; type hype.  Don&#x27;t believe it. You dang sure aren&#x27;t paying for a close shave. Sure, it&#x27;s self-cleaning, which means you have to fork out even more money per month to change the fluid cartridge, which makes it perpetually expensive.  And I couldn&#x27;t believe their instructions: Pull your skin tight and shave against the grain for best results.  Even with that, it just doesn&#x27;t cut it.....literally!    My little $10.00 travel [[ASIN:B001E6KB4Y Microforce Shaver]] shaves as good or better.  I AM NOT KIDDING!  Do not buy this Braun unless you just have money to burn and like blinking, flashing lights. If that&#x27;s the case, you can also get your Butler to push its \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; button for you.</li>
    <li> Best razor I have owned.  This one replace a 5 year old Braun with the battery giving out.  Rather than replace the battery, I purchased the new razor.  It was a great decision.</li>
    <li> Okay,  I have had this razor for about 5 months.  I got it for Father&#x27;s Day 2010.  I have had electric razors before, my old Braun died after about 4yrs and I had been using the Gillette Fusion for about 6 months.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS Braun!  The only time you really get a close shave is when you wake up first thing in the morning and shave before anything else. It&#x27;s true,  I did not believe Braun when they suggested it in their manual, but it is true.  Even then the shave is not as close as a blade.     The biggest problem is the cleaning unit base.  It is poorly made and the contacts in the unit get depressed and stuck.  The posts on the razor are supposed to touch these and activate the cleaning.  Well the springs wear out after a short time and they do not make contact, and the unit will not charge or clean the razor.  So this means you have to manually charge and clean the razor again.  Do yourself a favor, don&#x27;t waste your money on the cleaning unit and learn to clean it manually every couple of days.  Personally, save your money and just use the Gillette Fusion with the battery operated vibrating handle; a much better unit and closer shave.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for a month now and absolutely love it. I am 40 and have been shaving electrically my whole life. This is the best shaver I have ever owned. Before I had to have 2 shavers, one for my neck(a Braun) and the other for my face(a Norelco). I just couldn&#x27;t use a rotary shaver on my neck because it would leave shaver burn badly. So I decided to get this shaver cause I use a Braun for my neck already and the lower end model I have now wasn&#x27;t fast enough for my face. This one is fast and I can use it on both my neck and face. Nicely built and the head on this thing pivots very nicely. The side burn trimmer cuts very close as well, the only thing is that when you have it popped out, the shaver and your hand is in the way to see where you are shaving on your side burns. Not a big deal though. Well worth the money. I only use the cleaning feature a couple times a week. Still on the same cleaning cartridge, should last a while yet.</li>
    <li> i would recommend this product to all men for a shaving system that works from day one,try it it is a winner,with your money back if you do not like it. william sweller jr   i have a braun series7-790cc pulsonic shaver</li>
    <li> We now have 3 of these Braun shavers - I had to buy one for my husband when our two boys took theirs to college.  Amazon was amazing with their customer service, since I had a problem with the first one ordered.  They took care of the problem immediately and have earned a customer for life.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have owned several electric shavers in the past.  This Braun series 7 is the best I have ever owned.  This is the closest to a blade shave that you can get.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my husband. So far he am pleased with this product.  We were a little surprised at how much noise it makes while shaving and during the cleaning process.  It is not awful, just didn&#x27;t think it would make that much noise. He will put up with the noise for the comfortable shave!</li>
    <li> I ordered this to replace an older Braun that I liked a lot but after many years of service, the battery just wasn&#x27;t as powerful as it once was so I decided it was time to upgrade.  The redesigned shape of the Series 7 is much more comfortable to use and the cutting surfaces flex quite a bit better than the old design, making it easier to get a close shave.  The cleaning/charging base does an excellent job so the shaver is always ready without a lot of hassle.  Although I don&#x27;t normally do it, I like being able to rinse the head under water if I&#x27;m traveling.    Amazon had the best deal by far and the package arrived in just a couple of days.  Bottom line:  If you want the best, get this one!</li>
    <li> The Braun Series 7-790cc Pulsonic Shaver is absolutely the best electric shaver I have ever used these past 50 years.  It provides the smoothest shave outside of a razor. My shaving time has been cut in over half. I would give this shaver 6 stars if it was listed.  The Braun Series shaver is the BEST!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how this shaver compares to other shavers because this is my first electric in 15 years.  But I do know this doesn&#x27;t come close to the quality of a mach 3 shave.  If I have something important to be at I&#x27;m going to use my mach 3 fusion 100% of the time.  But if I just want to clean up this is good enough.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this razor for 7 months now and realize that I could of spent my money a little more wisely.  I used some Christmas money to purchase this as well as a promotion from [...].  I had high expectations as would anyone because of all the reviews here at amazon.  I have a average beard with fairly thick hair.  As other reviewers have stated this razor does have trouble where the neck meets the jaw.  I&#x27;ll keep it simple by listing the pros and cons with a brief description.  Pros:  It is one of the quietest razors I have used.  Been using electric for about 14 years.         I can use this on my face with no preping ie. creams or pretreatment and it doesn&#x27;t irritate at all.         It holds a charge for long time.  I&#x27;ve actually went 14 days straight just to see if it would and it did.         about 10 mins a day.         I open and knock out the clippings when I&#x27;m done but I use the charging/cleaning station every 3 days or so It&#x27;s cool to put it up to your face and it smell nice and clean.    Cons:  What I consider the worst thing about it, is that it takes almost TWICE as long to shave as my previous razor.  I think it is because the holes in the foil are triangular in shape as opposed to circular and a lot smaller than my other razor a Remington 390 series.  This results in MULTIPLE passes to pick up hair that should of been cut on the first pass.         I&#x27;ve had this razor tug and pinch me if you move it too quickly over your face.  I thought that that would be eliminated with the Pulsar technology but it&#x27;s still an issue.         At $12 a pop with every refill the refill station adds an expense that would normally not be there.         The trimmer works ok on the side burns but that is it.  Unlike the competition ie. remington with its trimmer set at 90 degrees, you can&#x27;t drag it across your face to catch those errant hairs.           And lastly, as I stated earlier, the inside corner between your jaw and neck is difficult for most razors and this one isno exception.  Multiple passes and circles and differing directions to try and catch every hair....It&#x27;s time consuming.  And Yes, this is where my remington excelled and saved me a lot of time and MONEY.    In conclusion, I have bought this razor to replace my remmington $[...] and even though it hasn&#x27;t worn out yet I will buy another remmington to replace this $[...] braun.</li>
    <li> I bought a series 7 Braun almost 2 years ago. I&#x27;d like to say it was the best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned,but there are a few things you should know before buying one. The shave overall, with a preshave product(with out preshave it gets very warm from friction) is great, fastest of any shaver.  The negatives:  1. this is a very noisy shaver. To the point of actually being uncomfortable, my ears ring after use.  2. The pop up trimer broke about 5 months after I bought it, the trimmer is not placed well or a very good trimmer anyway so I never tried to get it repaired.  3. The head lock stopped latching at about the one year mark. 4. the cleaning unit is very noisy, but I felt it was doing a good job... I was wrong!  I replaced the head assembly at the one year mark. After about 7 months with the new head I got some razor burn and a slight infection.  I cleaned the razor with a new cleaning cartidge about 7 times just to make sure it was clean.  I removed the shaver head and tapped it on my sink,  I could not believe all the black junk that kept coming out!  The head assembly is sealed and cannot be taken apart.    So if you buy a Series 7 be aware that there are parts not made well enough to stand up in some normal use respects.  As I said the trimmer is basically all but useless and breaks easily.  Most of all be aware that the cleaning cartidge does not clean the head assembly completely. I would suggest buying a new head assembyly every 6 months and soaking in alcohol then shaking and tapping on a hard surface to dislodge anything stuck inside at least once a week.</li>
    <li> I have used the 790cc for about a week.  I used the Norelco Arcitec 1090 before.  It was taking a long time to shave with the Arcitec.  I was having to finish up with a razor under my ears and neck.  The 790cc has been much quicker and closer shaving than the Arcitec.  I do not think it is loud at all.  Walmart sells the cleaner refill for $11.95 for two.  This unit is a little warmer to the skin than the Arcitec.  The 790cc will shave much closer. I have not had the \\&quot;baby\\&quot; feel in years. This will do it.  I do take the heads off and rinse them before I put unit in the cleaner.  I actually enjoy shaving in the morning now and have to know when to stop shaving because this unit will just keep going (well below the skin). I don&#x27;t want to go too low to avoid ingrown hairs issues. Overall, I am pleased with the Braun 790cc. I actually wake up looking forward to shaving with the 790cc.  I used to dread my time with the Norelco Arcitec 1090.  And this considering I used Norelco for 35 years.  For me, this really beats the Norelco Arcitec.</li>
    <li> I purchased the shaver for my friend, he really likes the shaver although I must admit, the first one stopped working after only 4 weeks.  Amazon was really great about sending a replacement pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000Q6SU3C Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic  Shaver]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I replaced my 7 year old \\&quot;Braun Syncro\\&quot; with a new \\&quot;Series 7\\&quot;. It is undoubtedly the BEST electric shaver that I have ever owned. I wanted to make my \\&quot;Syncro\\&quot; my second shaver so I went to the Braun Website and decided on the \\&quot;7\\&quot; almost immediately. I am pleasantly amazed at the improved quality of the shave between the two. I particularly appreciate the capability of the cleaning system to regulate the amount of fluid used based on the amount of time between cleanings; i.e. if the shaver is relatively clean less fluid ids used thus starching the capacity of the tank. I strongly recommend this shaver to anyone!!</li>
    <li> WORSTE SHAVE YET! I am a diehard Braun fan and have always loved Braun razors over norelco or any other brand, but this razor stinks. I have to keep going over and over my beard and then, the shave is still not great. My old Braun which is totally worn out and you have to hold the cord in to get a charge does a MUCH better job and the head is a few years old. THE WORSTE PART  about the whole deal is this razor is NOT RETURNABLE TO AMAZON. I will try and call Braun tomorrow and raise heck about it, but have never had this sort of issue where you physically   CAN&#x27;T return a $250 item. BAD BAD BAD customer service BAD BAD BAD razor...Ratings are skewed based upon the fact that the consumer has a past experience and that past experience   is a HUGE part of what affects the rating. My past experience is that I have been a Braun guy for 20 years and this is definitely not a good one. I\\&quot;m hoping Braun will customer service me...maybe I&#x27;ll return to this review and up the stars to two.</li>
    <li> This is the first time i have started shaving with electric shavers, i had used blades for over 20 years and tried an electric shaver from a friend for a few weeks decades ago and it never worked. However, this shaver is excellent, after 2-3 week period of getting used to shaving and technique, i get the best shave. Three of my friends have purchased this after my experience. Great product.</li>
    <li> works great, and is self cleaning, easy to use. what more can you ask for. it is expensive, and i don&#x27;t know that any razor is worth as much as this one costs, but i don&#x27;t regret the purchase a bit.</li>
    <li> I sacrified my face for you!  I&#x27;ve owned at least 7 electric razors, that I can recall, and I wasn&#x27;t really pleased with any of them.  I always do research, before I buy an item, but I hadn&#x27;t done that with electric shavers.  My research showed that this shaver was the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The research was correct.  This is the best electric razor that I have ever owned!  Even more impressive is that this shaver gives a shave that is much better than I ever thought was possible with an electric razor.  I&#x27;ve tried going 3 days without shaving, then using this electric razor.  It shaved perfectly, which wasn&#x27;t possible with my other electric razors.  They would have yanked at the stubble and it would have been uncomfortable to shave with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can it shave as close as a blade razor?  YES!  If you follow the instructions and shave before you wash your face and stretch the skin, as you shave, then you can get a close shave.  Even using very mild pressure, you can get an acceptable looking shave.  To get a shave comparable to a blade razor, I found that you need to press it harder against your face and shave against the direction of the beard growth.  It took awhile, but I actually got a closer shave than was possible with a blade razor - without any bleeding involved!  I&#x27;ve tried pressing this shaver against my face really hard and there was no discomfort or razor burns.  This wouldn&#x27;t have been possible with any of my other electric razors.  Of course, there is no need to press it that hard - I was just curious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver comes with a charging base that can also automatically clean the razor.  You insert the cleaning solution container into the base and it determines the level of cleaning that the razor needs, then you press the button if you want it to clean the razor for you.  The cleaning solution contains alcohol, a lubricant and a nice fragrance.  You can also clean it using the included brush or by running water over the shaving head, but youwill need to add oil if you use that method.  I will use the automatic method as the cleaning cartridges are reasonably priced and should last a month, or more. Although my Walmart didn&#x27;t carry any Braun shavers, they do carry the cleaning cartridges, as does amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver price seems high, but when compared to all the other electric shavers that I have bought, I&#x27;ve spent much more on all of them and I wasn&#x27;t happy with any of them.  I also considered how much I&#x27;ve probably spent on razors and shaving cream over a period of several years.  Now I don&#x27;t have to run to the store when I find I&#x27;m out of razor blades or shaving cream!  I expect this shaver will last me many years, so I will actually save money over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver has a LCD display that shows the battery level and the hygiene level.  How the shaver computes the latter, is a mystery to me.  I tried just leaving the shaver running, without shaving, and it shows the razor is still clean;  So it is truly sensing the hygiene of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only possible negative is there is not a nice leather carrying case included.  The shaver does comes in a hard plastic case.  After thinking about it, I realized that the plastic case will protect the razor better than a leather one.  There isn&#x27;t room for the charging cord in the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging cord, or rather the plug end, is my only real complaint.  The plug is very large and is a problem as with the plug in outlet multiplier, that I use, the plug is too wide and it takes up the space of two outlets.  But that is my only complaint, and it is a minor complaint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy this shaver, I feel certain that you will be very pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  To add to an already long review, I must tell you that I still use this same razor.  It has worked flawlessly, I&#x27;ve never had to have it sharpened, replace a battery or anything!  It is the absolute best electric razor known to man!  One tip:  I highly recommend using the fluid that the base uses to clean this razor.  I personally have never cleaned it with a brush and it is still as clean as when I bought it.  A PERFECT gift!  (No, I do NOT own their stock!). Oh, I&#x27;ve also never once received a razor burn!</li>
    <li> Simply put - its a new generation - no more irretation or any kind of pain even with the longest hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome prodcut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long Hair cutter is way smaller..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line. The best shaver I ever had in 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joachim Grafe</li>
    <li> My original Braun is about 10 years old and just wouldn&#x27;t poop out. I finally decided to bite the bullet and order the 790cc figuring new technology would be better and WOW, was I ever right about that. This new shaver gives the smootest shave and doesn&#x27;t miss a hair. The automated cleaner is also top of the line. My thanks to Braun for such a terrific product and to Amazon for very reasonable prices and ease of ordering and shipping plus reminders of needed supplies.</li>
    <li> Was so looking forward to \\&quot;upgrading\\&quot; my shaver and heard/read so many great things about this one.. First the shave is really not very good at all... Maybe cuz I&#x27;ve shaved with a rotary for 20 years or more, but I was not happy with this shave at all. The trimmer is not very good either and you cannot see where to trim as the shaver head is so big it hides the trimmer.. The shave was rough and the head heated up and I don&#x27;t like that feeling on my skin.. I had to go over spots multiple times. The cleaning unit is huge too and seems to be just another plot to extract money from us for cleaning supplies... I blew $200 on this??? I&#x27;m going back to the rotary..</li>
    <li> Every morning while shaving my husband tells me how he just loves his new shaver.   So even if he is out of town, he&#x27;ll be thinking of me when he shaves every morning....that&#x27;s a good thing!</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd Braun razor that we have had and both have had the cleaning stand stop working after about 13 months. The current one is \\&quot;under warranty\\&quot; but that means I have to take it to a service center that is out of my way and they will have it for an undetermined amount of time. And Braun customer service tells you that \\&quot;we would not expect this to happen again\\&quot; but are unwilling to extend the warranty. I have no doubt in another 13 months I will be buying a new razor since the stand will most likely break again and we will no longer have a warranty.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I have ever had, smoothe to the face great clippers gerat cleaning system.  Braun series 7-790cc pulsonic shaver.</li>
    <li> in the 60s, during my college years, I used a rotary shaver with mixed results.  Since I am on blood thinning medication I can&#x27;t risk the probability of shaving nicks using a blade.  This shaver solved that problem.  It is very comfortable with no skin irritation.  This shaver is extremely easy to use, fast, and clean up is a breeze with the self-cleaning charger/cleaning stand.  It shaves much closer than I expected and was used to with my old rotary shaver.  However, if you are expecting this or any other electric shaver to shave as close as a blade you are not being realistic.  It just won&#x27;t happen.  But if you are looking for a shaver that shaves closer than any electric I have tried, is fast, easy to handle, and cleans itself you will love this shaver, even though it may be a little pricey.  Amazon.com has very competitive pricing, excellent customer service, and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I have had a few Braun razors. The most recent one lasted nearly 12 years, so the 790 will have a hard act to follow. The old one (I don&#x27;t remember what model) was the first with the clean &amp; renew system and while I thought it might be a gimmick, it proved to be really great at keeping the unit clean (and shaving better as a result).   The 790 instantly won me over with the fact that it doesn&#x27;t feel like it is doing anything. At the end the hair is gone, but the old one (probably quite dull and the batteries certainly didn&#x27;t have their original vigour) seemed to chew the hair off my face in comparison. The small display on the bottom of the shaver has a series of blocks; one half tells you the charge status and the other half the \\&quot;hygiene\\&quot; status (how dirty it is). Apparently there is a central icon that reminds you to change the cutting head. I miss the more informative display of the old model - it had a multi-dot screen that displayed text messages (such as clean!) and icons (a happy face when all was well) as well as graphically displaying charge/discharge and more.     Ultimately a shaver is about shaving and this one seems to do the job with good power, a gentle touch and a minimum of time.     I wonder if the LiIon batteries in this one can be persuaded to keep running for a decade like the NiMH batteries in the prior model? I have my doubts.</li>
    <li> For the first ten weeks this was a good shaver. It was very quiet - much quieter than earlier Braun shavers that I have used.  In the tenth week, mid-shave, it became VERY loud. So loud that it hurt my ears when trying to shave near to them.  Amazon will not let you return this item, because the cleaning fluid is alcohol-based. so I second another reviewers comments \\&quot;Don&#x27;t buy this from Amazon\\&quot;.  I shall not buy another Braun shaver. Their quality has gotten steadily worse in the last 10 years.</li>
    <li> This is yet another improvement over the prior Braun models.  Simply put it is the finest electric razor available.  The self cleaning docking station makes it virtually maintenance free.</li>
    <li> After having used Braun shavers since their first model, and a couple of others, I find this Series 7 to be by far the best.  After using it for three weeks, it gives a very smooth shave, without ever hurting my skin even if I go back again and again to clean up any left over hard spots.  It is not exactly cheap but pleasant to use and I can wholeheartedly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This must have been the worst investment I have made. It broke after 32 days.</li>
    <li> This is the fourth Braun shaver that I have owned and it is by far the best. This shaver shaves as close as a blade without all the nicks and cuts. When my Dad say how close and smooth this shaver shaved my face he asked me to get one for him. My Dad is 86 years old and been a \\&quot;blade\\&quot; man all his life. After the first time that he used his new Braun he said that he would never go ack to a blade, again. I love this product and would recommend it to anyone thinking about trying a foil shaver.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a low-end Braun shaver that is about 20 years old. I wasted my money. This does not shave any closer than my old shaver, so for all the so-called technological advances in terms of pivoting head and dual foils, and all the bells and whistles, etc., nothing has been gained in performance. Furthermore, this shaver tugs hairs from time to time if you don&#x27;t go really slowly. I&#x27;ll grant that it&#x27;s quieter, which is nice, but that&#x27;s the only improvement I&#x27;m seeing.</li>
    <li> Been a Braun Shaver user for several years. This pulsonic shaver gives me the closest shave i have ever experienced. Rate it as exellent</li>
    <li> This shaver cits as close as a blade shave. Very easy to setup and operate.</li>
    <li> Over the past 25-30 years, I have had numerous electric shavers of the typical brands (Sunbeam, Remington, Norelco) - all of them disappointments causing me to return to the nicks and scratches that come with getting a close shave with a razor blade. At first, I was reluctant to spend the money for this top of the line Braun...it was a risky investment given its price. But I saw it as my last attempt at electric shaving.    This shaver is worth every penney. The features, specially the self-cleaning, are great. The self-cleaning really works and leaves the shaver spotless without the usual hassle of having to brush the heads clean or rinsing the heads underwater and setting the shaver to dry.     The close shave from this Braun is the best you will ever get with an electric shaver and comparable with traditional razor blades (but without nicks and cuts)!    The only \\&quot;negatives\\&quot; with the Braun are price and the fact that the cutting surface operates at such high RPMs, that it warms up a bit during shaving (but not uncomfortably hot). On the positive side, the shave is great and the design of the head cuts through both \\&quot;longer\\&quot; standing hairs and the usual stubble. The heads need only be replaced every 18 months and the cleaning agent that comes in the cartridge is both easy to install and lasts longer than I thought. In short, this is truly a hassle-free appliance and the only electric shaver to have!</li>
    <li> First electric shaver that i can use with comfort. Prior shavers have been very irritating to my skin,and in some cases have pulled rather than cut face hair.  The self cleaning feature is outstanding.</li>
    <li> I wish I had read before I did.  The shaver is not worth the money you spend if you have a tough beard.  I do and I thought with the new \\&quot;technology\\&quot; promised, I would get a better shave than with my older electric shavers. I did not.  Actually, my older Braun series 3 cuts closer and in much less time than this one does.  The cleaning feature is very nice but not worth the extra $130 you spend on it from a lower series Braun.    The main reason I wrote this review is to warn people that if you buy it and have a poor experience like I did YOU CANNOT RETURN IT THROUGH AMAZON.  Because this shaver comes with the cleaning fluid which is flamable, Amazon will not allow you to return it.  You can return it to Braun within 60 days but you have to ship it to them in either GERMANY or AUSTRAILIA. The shipping charges are really high.    So just be warned before you purchase.</li>
    <li> I am 54 years old, and got sick to death of scraping my face with a razor every day. I had tried a rotary shaver several years ago, and was not pleased with the results. I decided to try a foil one, as I had used one many years ago, when they first came out.    What a differance! Foil technology has certainly come a long way! This thing comes very close to shaving as close as a blade. The shaver fits well in the hand, and the pivoting head and blades adapt to the contours of the face very well. The cleaning / charging base works very well, and the lubrication makes for a much cooler shave. Braun says that the cleaning cartridge should last about a month, but I have been using it daily for 6 weeks, now, and the &#x27;full&#x27; LED is still on. Comes with a nifty plastic travel case, that is very well designed.    On the down side, it takes several weeks for your face to get used to a foil razor. Braun says to shave before washing your face, as the skin oils help lubricate your skin. It is very important to hold your skin taut while shaving, to keep stray hairs from being plucked by the razor. Some consider the razor pricey, but if you shop around, any electric razor with a cleaning base falls into this price range.    I am quite satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Its good but not as good as the Braun that I am replacing.  Unfortunatley after five years my older braun is dying a slow death.  I purchased the more expensive shaver in hopes that it would match the quality of the older one but it did not.</li>
    <li> This shaver is by far the best I have owned. I did not like electric shavers much before getting the Braun Series 7. I would recommend it greatly.</li>
    <li> This expensive razor started out as the best ever, but after several months, it is slower, the shave is not as close and it is more irritating to the skin. I have a light beard and sensitive skin.  All razors, blade or electric, have caused irritation to my skin. This is still a good razor.</li>
    <li> The Braum 7-790cc does a great job for a heavy beard. I tried several of the Norelco shavers and they  didn&#x27;t have the cutting ability as the Braum. I am very pleased with the Braum 7-790cc and would recommend this shaver if you have a heavy beard and need some real cutting power.</li>
    <li> Great shaver but all the shavings fall out and little stays in the shaving head area.</li>
    <li> After many, many years using rotary shavers, I was happy to find the 7- 790cc.  It has made it much easier for this 88 year old to shave thru all the wrinkles and around the mouth.  Also it does a much better job shaving my head bald.  So far the cleaning system does great.  The whole experience has caused me to be more interested in keeping myself well groomed.</li>
    <li> This is My 3rd Shaver and I Love it. It is very smooth and when you clean it, it is much nicer.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this if you want to get the new Braun.</li>
    <li> This razor is an excellent quality product. I suspect it will last a loooong time. The blades need changing at about the 18 month time. It has a good internal 3.8V LiOn battery and does a decent job shaving. The only issue I&#x27;ve had in two years use is the board containing the battery can move slightly if the shaver is accidentally dropped or jarred (maybe in the clean up cycle?}. The springy contacts from the battery control board to the motor housing don&#x27;t make contact causing the shaver to stop. It is an easy fix by prying on the sides of the rubber housing with a thin blade screwdriver to remove it exposing the second cover. Undoing the 4 screws and removing the second cover exposes the battery compartment and control board. The copper contact pins from the battery board need to be stretched out slightly so they contact the motor housing firmly. Reassemble and you are ready to go. All in all this is a well made shaver and does a good job for me.</li>
    <li> It keeps my wife happy, because without this thing she would be married to Santa Claus, The Hatfields or The McCoys.&lt;br /&gt;I still manage to grow a short beard during the winter until she complaints too loudly. This thing will NOT cut beards and it not suppose to.</li>
    <li> Head lock not working after first shave. For this price I would expect better quality. Closeness of shave is just the same as a $50 rotary Norelco. Not satisfied with this purchase since I now have doubts about the quality of this shaver. If a simple mechanism breaks without having been abused, I have serious doubts that all the rest of fancy and cheap plastic perks will last enough to justify the price paid. Do not recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> Very good product!!! I bought this for my husband about 2 weeks ago and he loves it!! He would deffinetly reccomend this product to anyone. The price is pretty exspensive but the quality is worth it. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the Braun 790 for over a year now and it&#x27;s performed flawlessly and gives a great shave. Others will perhaps write long and exhaustive reviews but I&#x27;m just going to say that my sensative skin appreciates this shaver every day. Just great.</li>
    <li> I got this for my father some time ago.  He uses it daily and is pleased with it.  The only downside (if I may call it that) is that the self cleaning requires cartridges changes which can be costly. However, I bought that by the bulk on Amazon as well!</li>
    <li> I like this product, I have been using it for almost a year now. It shaves well, and there is no irritation. I used to get little cuts every so often with a razor, but that&#x27;s a thing of the past. It also helps keep sideburns nice between haircuts. I will say that the shave is not super close to the skin, but it&#x27;s good enough that I&#x27;d take the lack of irritation as a good tradeoff. Also, I find it does shave better when you clean it after each use. When I&#x27;m on trips, I just run it under water and it does clean a bit too, but the cleaning solution works best.</li>
    <li> Since 1999 I&#x27;ve only had two electric shavers, both were Braun.  I got this one in 2007 as a birthday gift from my wife.  I was satisfied with the performance...then the real test occurred.  I took the shaver with me on my 12 month deployment to Iraq.  I didn&#x27;t have it as bad as some guys, but we spent a lot of time in the field living with the Iraqis, sleeping on the deck, no showers etc.  The shaver held up well, still shaving in poor/dirty conditions.  It even held it&#x27;s charge for 1-2 weeks at a time when I was unable to charge it.  I had to change out the cartridges a bit more often than normal, but this was a small price to pay.  The whole year I just charged it with the cord and cleaned it by tapping the cartridge against something hard or just using water because I didn&#x27;t bring the holder/cleaner.  I&#x27;m sure I could go into a lot more detail about how impressed I am, but all in all I am very satisfied.  It still works at damn near 100% except for the trimmer which broke during a hard fall (it still works, I just have to hold it with my finger, which I don&#x27;t mind).  Considering the thing survived two IED explosions I&#x27;m extremely impressed.  I came on to see if there was a new model out..maybe one that makes coffee or something by now, but it looks like it&#x27;s relatively the same so I&#x27;ll just stick with this one.  Hey, if ain&#x27;t broke don&#x27;t fix it I guess.  So if you&#x27;re a low maintenance guy like me with nothing but a toothbrush and a bar of soap in your bathroom, then this is the shaver for you.  Easy shave, easy clean, easy day.</li>
    <li> iv had a braun series 5 for 4 years  new series 7 is a masterpiece. it shaves as good as a razor</li>
    <li> I guess, it is too late to review now, but I will review it anyway.  I didn&#x27;t extensively use this as I do shave once per week.  When I started using it, my skin used to irritate, but I continued using it.  I really wish it is wet &amp; dry shaver.  When I bought it, wet shavers are not popular and now, I have 1 wet shaver from Philips and it cuts exactly the same as Brarun without any irritation.  Also, additional trimmers and trimmer cleaner is expensive.  Rather than buying trimmer cleaner every other week, it is cheaper to buy Gillette Quadra blades.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Braun Series 7 790 Pulsonic for about 5 months now.  I previously owned a Braun 360 and hated it because it ALWAYS pulled at my hairs, I actually dreaded shaving for the discomfort I knew I was going to be subjected to (And yes I did change the blades and foil to no resolution).  One day I was so irritated by it I finally just threw it in the trash.  I was very hesitant to purchase another Braun razor for obvious reasons, but after looking at some of the reviews and knowing I had a 60 day try out period with Braun I figured I would give them a shot again.  At first glance, the 790 looks very close to the 360 including the blade pattern.  However, the performance is completely different.  This one is actually comfortable to use without pulling at my whiskers while it shaves.    I am pleased that I purchased the Braun 790 because it is pretty quick at shaving, but more importantly it does not pull at my hairs, and you still get a close shave.  I would gladly sacrifice speed for better comfort, but with the 790 you don&#x27;t have to give up one for the other.  I would recommend that if you have similar experiences with electric razors pulling at hairs, as I did, give the Braun series 7 790 Pulsonic a try.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moWAVJ1CKNV5LP]]Here is my review of the Braun Series 7 - 790cc. You can find my full written review at Electric-Shaver-Guide.com.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver in 2009 and imagine I can give a pretty thorough review at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, let&#x27;s address the question of electric shavers.  Will it shave as close as a blade?  Absolutely not.  And it is not designed to do that.  Will you LOOK like it shaved as close as a blade?  Yes you will, if you take the time to let your face get used to it and stop using a blade you will look like you spend a lot more time shaving than you actually do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll start with the Pros to buying/using this shaver.  The design is great and it does not feel &#x27;cheap&#x27;.  it offers a good shave early in the morning when I am less than awake and it cleans itself so I don&#x27;t have to remember to take it apart and clean it.  The battery lasts forever (even after two years) so if you go on a business trip, you don&#x27;t have to take the cleaning base with you.  Also, if you need to be away for a really long time, like more than a week, the same cord that plugs into the cleaning base plugs into the shaver itself so you can recharge it on the go.  The cleaning fluid is nice for people who are prone to bad complexion because it sterilizes the razor after every use and an electric shaver is less harsh on your skin after your face gets used to it.  Also, I cannot prove that the pulsonic aspect of this shaver is \\&quot;better\\&quot; than other shavers but I definitely shave faster with this one than any other one I have owned before.  It is also much faster than using a traditional razor and shaving creme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the Cons, such that they are.  First and foremost, you have to remember to shave before you get in the shower and get your skin wet.  It took me a while to change my routine.  If you have not used an electric shaver before, you need to let your face have time to get used to it.  Most people/companies say give it 30 days.  I say give it a bit longer but that is only my personal opinion.  I have a pretty rough beard and it took longer for my face to adapt to the waythis thing cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One design flaw, after about a year, the silver coloring near the pivot of the razor started to peel off a bit.  Braun offered to replace it but I just never remembered/had the time to ship it back.  I applaud their customer service but wish it had not happened to begin with.  Still, it is only a cosmetic issue and does not affect the operation of the shaver (and in all honesty, I am NOT gentle with anything at 7am).  This would not keep me from buying another of their products but feel it should be mentioned.  I subtracted a star for this but it should really only be about a half star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for cost:  I have tried to estimate the cost of shaving with a traditional razor (mach 3 etc) and shaving cream vs using the Braun Plusonic and the cleaning fluid.  Keep in mind that Braun recommends that you buy a new cutting head every 16 months which costs about $50.  The cleaning refills cost about $16 for three (average, sometimes you can find them on sale for better) and last right at 30 days each.  All in all, including cost of upfront purchase, it seems that the Braun may be a few dollars more but they are pretty close so cost really should not be a huge factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My shaver is still working fine.  I have used it every day for two years and see no reason why I wont for two more years.  Overall, I am happy with the purchase.  It does exactly what it says; shaves the fuzzy stuff off your face and cleans itself.  If you are on the fence about electric shavers, give this one a try.  They are not for everyone but I have not bought a traditional razor in two years.  Take that for what it is worth.</li>
    <li> The title may seem melo-dramatic but there is no product in my life that has so altered my daily routine and been so satisfying as this electric shaver. I was a blade and shaving cream shaver for 20+ years using all of the different Mach 3, multiple blade, expensive disposable razors on the market. The few times I had tried cheaper electric razors I was disappointed or discouraged from ever trying an electric shaver. My wife got me the Braun 7 series for Christmas about 2 1/2 years ago and I have never gone back to disposable blades. This electric razor gives a close, smooth, and comfortable shave. Its cradle provides a very easy mechanism for cleaning (although you do have to buy the cleaning pods routinely), and maintains a charge for a long time. I do not believe any personal grooming product has been so useful -- in fact it is likely the best gift I&#x27;ve ever received (well, second to the Lego airport I got when I was 9).  I would recommend this product with absolute praise. It is worth every penny and likely will pay for itself in a few months since you will never again purchase blades.</li>
    <li> Since I started shaving, somewhere around 17 years old, I&#x27;ve been looking for an electric razor that could come anywhere near a blade.  I have a heavy beard and need to shave everyday. In 2008, at 52 years old, I found one and that is my Braun listed in the title above.  This shaver comes closer to a blade than any other I have tried and I&#x27;ve wasted money on a lot of them over the years.  I guess I&#x27;m one of the lucky ones because I&#x27;ve had no trouble with keeping the unit charged and am using all original parts.  Granted, when I want a really close shave I&#x27;ll go back to a blade but for day to day going to work, this is the best electric I have ever used period.&lt;br /&gt;Pricey, yes but just look at the price of blades these days.  And with a beard like mine, shaving cream out of a can is an invitation to cut the heck out of myself.  So between a good Cream Shave like Clinque and new blades the cost of the shaver over time is probably less.  I do agree getting replacement parts for this model is a pain in the neck.  I&#x27;m still using the original foil head because I can never find a Series 7 in a store.  After approx. 3 years and 6 months of almost daily use, my base unit is leaking the cleaning fluid so depending on how hard it is to fix this problem, I may be making comments on this initial review.  All in all, it is just a good feeling to have FINALLY found an electric that actually comes close to their advertising.  Lastly, no doubt about it, it is over priced but I think they can get away with this because the damned thing IS the best electric on the market.  I&#x27;m talking as of 2008, I&#x27;ve only started looking again because of the leakage problem I&#x27;m having with my Braun which, I hope I can find at a reasonable price.  The thing is just really cheap plastic housing.  Just my opinion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always attempted to use electric razors and have never been happy with them until this one. I&#x27;m in the military and shave every single day and it needs to be a close shave. This is my third attempt with an electric razor and I got the Braun at a great price. I&#x27;ve almost done the full 3 week break in period and I have to say I&#x27;m quite happy. I figure it can only get better from here. It still takes a decent amount of time to shave, but it is much easier. I absolutely love the cleaning base station. It always stays clean. Overall, very happy with this purchase and plan on using this for a very long time.</li>
    <li> I decided to compare the pulsonic and 360 complete by using the 30 day money back offer. So I bought both and tried them up for a few days each. While the 360 gave a good shave compared to the pulsonic it was like night and day. Suffice it to say that the 360 was shipped back to Braun today and won&#x27;t be missed.     I like the pulsonic better for a few reasons mostly because it gets me a better shave but also because the handle isn&#x27;t as big and fits more comfortably in my hand. With the pulsonic I can wrap my hand around the handle and its shaped way better than the 360.     The on/off button on the pulsonic is just that on/off while on the 360 it is also the lock switch and activates the trimmer.     I guess overall I feel like the pulsonic is designed better than the 360 and is justified in the difference in price.    UPDATE***    After a few weeks with this I can honestly say that I&#x27;ll use this on a daily basis and with the exception of weddings or other special engagements I&#x27;ll be using the Pulsonic. I&#x27;ve used other electrics before for about a week or so before I toss them in the drawer and forget about them, this is different. I can&#x27;t wait to shave with it in the morning.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun shavers for over fifteen years, and this is the best, by far.  The last model, the 8595, was a disappointment; it did not provide a very close shave, and left me with shaver burn.  The 9595, however, is a completely new cutter/foil design, and offers a superior shaving experience.  I recommend it without reservation.</li>
    <li> I have used $200 Braun&#x27;s and $300 Panasonics. I currently own seven late model, high-end shavers. (I also own a shaving museum from the 1930&#x27;s to the 1950&#x27;s). The Panasonic was very nice but no swiveling head. The new 9595CC is without flaw in any area: Closeness, comfort, smoothness, ease of use, ergonomics maintainance, and quietness. The German engineers really did their homework on this baby. To be honest, they outdid themselves! Plus, it maintains itself in four different areas. And it&#x27;s Ultra-sexy! Scroll down to Panasonics new $300 shaver. It is a virtual copy, almost word for word. If you are on a tight budget, the heavily discounted Panasonic might be a good buy. I have not tried it but it is interesting that Panasonic has copied Braun so directly. Just a few years ago, Braun was criticized in online reviews for being behind the times. Not any more baby, not any more!!</li>
    <li> Bought this shaver for my husband. He loves it!!! Here&#x27;s my husband&#x27;s review: If you haven&#x27;t figured it out yet, the new Braun Pulsonic is even better as a wet shaver. Notice that it says WASHABLE in letters you can&#x27;t miss on the front of the shaver. Simply wet your face, put on some Gillette Foamy shaving cream, and get ready for an incredibly close shave!! FIRST, shave with the shaving head in the UNLOCKED position, and then followup by shaving with the shaving head in the LOCKED position. Wow, what a shave!! This doesn&#x27;t take long as the Pulsonic is fast and powerful and zips right through your beard. Take your fingers AGAINST the grain of your beard to see how close this shave is!!    If you want an even closer shave, FIRST shave ONLY WITH THE GRAIN of your beard (NOT against the grain)using a typical Gillette double or triple blade. Then finish up with the Pulsonic. This seems to get the longer, flat lying hairs a little better. After all, it&#x27;s the shaving AGAINST the grain of your beard with a blade that produces the nicks and iritation.    Can&#x27;t figure out why Braun doesn&#x27;t advertise the Pulsonic as a WET shaver. Maybe it&#x27;s because Braun had to cut a deal with Panasonic to use Panasonic&#x27;s Linear motor in the Pulsonic. Maybe Panasonic still has a patent on its Linear motor. Anyway, I&#x27;ve used both the latest Panasonic wet/dry shaver as a wet shaver and the Braun Pulsonic as a wet shaver. The results are that the Pulsonic shaves much closer and without the irritation of the Panasonic.    Give the Pulsonic a try as a WET shaver; it&#x27;s the best wet shaver yet!!!</li>
    <li> Love it! The closest shave with an electric razor. Very convenient, in less than five minutes I can get a nice, close shave and not have to worry about cuts. The Clean &amp; Renew system is also very convenient.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver to replace an older Braun, not pulsonic.  It shaved no closer than the old one and has a shorter battery life.  I replaced it with the top Panasonic razor.  Much better choice.  Disappointed in Braun.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a very loyal Norelco (SmartTouch 9195XL) user for years, and always buy the top of the line Norelco&#x27;s when they come out.  I used a Braun for a few days about 12 years ago and that was enough to to see that Norelco was far better at that time.  However, I haven&#x27;t been happy with Norelco for many years... as I&#x27;ve gotten older, the longer it took to shave with the Norelco (upwards of 15 minutes to get all the hairs) and I started noticing significant irritation (especially on my neck).  I would replace the shaving blades, but that wouldn&#x27;t help.  I would replace the Norelco, but that wouldn&#x27;t help.  So, I&#x27;ve always been on the lookout for a better electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw the reviews of Braun&#x27;s Pulsonic, I knew I&#x27;d have to try it.  And I&#x27;m happy I did.  It is FAR better than Norelco&#x27;s Smart Touch 9195XL Razor that I&#x27;ve used for the past two years.  FAR BETTER.  The shave time is significantly less, it gets far more hairs on its first pass, and the irritation is also far less (still a bit there, but far, far less than Norelco).  I also like the daily cleaning option as it is a vast improvement over just running the razor under water which is time-consuming and not enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To summarize... the Braun Pulsonic is WAY, WAY better than the Norelco Smart Touch 9195XL.  I was a loyal Norelco user for over a decade, and now I will be sticking to Braun.  Unless, that is, Norelco is able to come out with something significantly better, of course.</li>
    <li> Purchased this pricey item for my husband.  He absolutely LOVES IT and says it&#x27;s worth EVERY PENNY!</li>
    <li> I have been using Gillette razors for my entire shaving life....20 years or so.  I finally decided that I was fed up with gel&#x27;s, cut&#x27;s, and the cost of blades..to name a few.  I figured I would buy myself a xmas gift and this Pulsonic came up on my radar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had it for a few weeks now and use it regularly....if not daily.  I have stored my classic razors and gels in the vanity....just in case.  However, they will be going in the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pulsonic does exactly what it should and then some.  My only problems, and they are my problems, are that I have too much razor damage on my face and thus it takes me a minute or two extra to shave with the Pulsonic to get a close shave; especially around the neck area where I have some ingrown hairs.  Other then that I cant stop raving about this unit...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought a Norelco Arcitec which I returned after 1 use...there is simply no comparison to the Pulsonic...and who can give up that automatic cleaning feature.  This unit has some weight to it which makes it feel good in your hands.  The vibrating action is enough to get the blood flowing in the AM - feels like a facial massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go ahead..give it a try...you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> My husband is very happy with his xmas gift. He thinks this new shaver is a toy, the lights are very cool and the shave is very close and last for a long time. Very good product!</li>
    <li> Okay folks - I have never written a review before, but always read them before I made any purchases. First, let me say that I have sensitive skin, and always hated shaving. I have used a Norelco shaver (top of the line models) for over 15 years and got what I would consider a fair/good shave. I wouldn&#x27;t say that I loved the Norelcos, but they always did the job. After having my same shaver stolen twice by airport personnel from my suitcase over the past 3 months, I decided now was the time to try something new. My brother had just purchased this razor and RAVED about it.    As with all shavers, there is an adjustment period which I dealth with. With each day, the shaving never got any better and I tried everything (holding it differently, locking the head, etc.) Every time I shaved, my face had more cuts than the last time, skin got red, and I barely removed any facial hair!!! Finally after 4 weeks of using this thing, I returned it to the store and went with a Norelco Artica shaver. Yes, the shaver looked great, and the cleaning chamber was a plus, etc....But it never did what it was supposed to.. It never shaved my face well! With that said, not every face is designed for this shaver.     Again, my brother loves it, and I know my review won&#x27;t persuade you, but I do want to give you a non-subjective piece of criticism - I travel often for periods of a week and found that this shaver does NOT keep as long of a charge as the Norelco&#x27;s. In addition, within 4 days, the \\&quot;Hygeine meter\\&quot; was maxed out indicating it needed a cleaning. While you can clean it with regular water, it never resets itself until you put it back in the cleaning pod. I just found that to be annoying.    Good luck with your shaving endeavors. While I was expecting a &#x27;break in period&#x27; with the Artica, it never happened! I have never recieved a better shave with any previous Norelco razor and would compare the new shave to a straight edge!</li>
    <li> I have used many different electric razors over the years.  None provided as close a shave as a regular razor...that is until I purchased this piece.  Superb...Highly recommend</li>
    <li> just wanted to say i recently purchased this braun electric shaver for a christmas gift.the fellow i purchased it for is on blood thinners for a heart condition that he has.he was complaining that when he shaves,because of the medications he would get red lines on the cheeks of his face,and neck.and he was contemplating buying a electric shaver,but complained when ever he would use one it would always pull and never feel like it was getting the shave close enough.well he absolutely loves this new braun shaver and swears he&#x27;ll never go back to a blade and cream again. now i wish i would of tried it out first myself before i gave it to him!!!! oh well.  good job braun,keep up the technology!!</li>
    <li> I like my new shaver...especially the automated cleaning part and its overall feel of quality.  My previous shaver was the best Norelco triple-head. I don&#x27;t notice a tremendous difference in stubble with the Pulsonic and tend to think that the shaver is overpriced.  The benefits of the cleaning system also mean that you have to purchase the refills so it can be even more expensive.  I guess that I was expecting something unbelievably good but found merely incremental improvements.</li>
    <li> I have always previously had a Philips electric shaver (Norelco in the States). I decided to junk my latest Aquasonic Philips when I thought it was just not a very close shaver. And I decided on the Braun as a result of one of the reviews on this site. I was a bit hesitant about this as you never know who the hell is writing the review, but I thought what the hell? Well, I&#x27;m glad I did. This Braun shaver gives a closer shave than ANY OTHER ELECTRIC SHAVER I&#x27;VE EVER HAD. I can assure you I&#x27;m not being paid to say this. It&#x27;s true. It&#x27;s far better than the crappy Philips model I used to have. The Brain cleans itself and every shave with it is as close as a manual shave. It feels good. I always finish by thinking to myself that this is how a good shave ought to feel. In short, I couldn&#x27;t recommend this shaver more. It costs more than most, but the money is well spent.</li>
    <li> I have used electric shavers for over 50 years, and the Pulsonic 9595 is by far the finest shaver I have ever experienced.  It shaves close, is quiet, and fast.  It&#x27;s not cheap, but based on my limited experience with it so far it is worth the money.</li>
    <li> First, a little background: I&#x27;ve been a loyal razor shaver for the last 4-5 years. My first electric shaver was a cheap Remington that didn&#x27;t work back in 2002. That made me anti-electric razor for years. However, as the years have gone by I&#x27;ve realized I&#x27;m one of the lucky ones to have sensitive skin and ingrown neck hairs due to razor shaving. I did my research and everyone recommends electric shavers.    After a lot of research I bought the Braun 9595. A lot of my friends were long time Braun users and highly recommended the brand as well. My friend even gave me a free 3 cleaning pack as a welcome into the Braun club. :)    The Braun 9595 is a great shaver. It is a lot quieter than other electric shavers I&#x27;ve seen and it does cut a whole lot better as well. I really like the pivoting head as it makes for a really comfortable shave. However, I learned the hard way that you have to shave against the grain with Electric shavers (unlike razor blades).    Although this shaver doesn&#x27;t shave as close as my old 5 blade Razor - I&#x27;ve already seen noticeable decrease in razor burn (even on day 2). I definitely recommend this for you guys like me who have a problem with razor burn on their neck. The pop out trimmer is perfect for stubborn hair that doesn&#x27;t want to pop out (ingrown hair). Just make sure to shave against the grain really slowly and not with it.    The cleaning system is really amazing. After you get done shaving just stick the shaver into the base and it automatically detects the cleaning level. After you hit the center button the shaver turns on and you can hear the cleaning solution going through it. Just be aware that it takes a good set of minutes before the cleaning is done. The refills are supposed to last 30 days so I clean the shaver every 2 shaves (1 cleaning refill should last 2 months). After 2 shaves the shaver says it wants a Normal Clean (as I clean it with water anyway). After the automatic cleaning is done the shaver head has a nice lemon smellto it (not overpowering in the least bit).    A big concern of mine was the ability to travel with this shaver. This shaver has a place to plug in the electrical cord directly (though you can normally recharge it through the base). I travel now and then so this was a big deal for me. I recommend this for people who do a lot of traveling.    The cleaning solution is made in Ireland and the Braun Pulsonic 9595 itself is made in Germany. A FYI if you are interested in that sort of stuff like I am.    Something to note: As a guy coming from razor blades into the electric shaver world - my face gets really dry after a shave now. You might want to have some lotion handy to relieve the dryness.      Without a doubt I would highly recommend this shaver to anyone - especially for guys like me who get razor burn using razor blades. It sure is a nice feeling knowing I won&#x27;t be buying $24 razor blade replacements every 2 months...</li>
    <li> There are many reviews of this product already, but few mention use on the road.    Summary - Superb shave, great for traveling.    Here are my experiences:    1) The shave is excellent, not quite a &#x27;mach 3&#x27; equivalent, but far far better than any other electric razor I have ever owned.  2) Battery life is very good.  A full charge lasts me way over a week on the road, could even be two weeks.  3) Cleaning is simple in a hotel room.  I just stick the head under running water, and take the foil off and give it a good rinse when I have the time or inclination.  4) The hygiene meter will register on &#x27;empty&#x27; after a few days indicating that the razor really wants to be cleaned in its own base.  This does not stop it working or alter the fine performance.  I just start the clean cycle when you get home.  5) You can charge the razor in your hotel if you bring the same cord that plugs into the base station.  6) The carrying case is semi-transparent clear/white plastic and the razor has some shiny chrome.  The unit appears dense on x-ray of hand baggage and has invited secondary inspection on several occasions. But, the razor is clearly a razor so no worries there.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a gift for a friend. He thought it is too complicated to use, also that it takes up too  much \\&quot;real estate\\&quot; in the bathroom and asked me to return it. It is NOT RETURNABLE to Amazon because of the liquid cleaning agent included. I am struggling to find out from Braun how to return it. If you are not absolutely sure about this product do not order it. It may be a great product to some, but if you think you might need to return it DON&#x27;T ORDER IT.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the Coast Guard and I shave every day. This shaver makes it easy and keeps my skin looking great. As close as any razor. It&#x27;s a must have, you really get what you pay for. In the long run it saves you money, you don&#x27;t have to replace blades every few days.</li>
    <li> I have been using electric razors since I was 14, 65 years ago; and the Braun 9595 is the best ever! It isn&#x27;t noisy, and it cuts beard with one stroke.  I tend to use it for too long a time, for I have yet to convince my self that it is actually cutting well so easily.  The only difficulty I have had with it is getting acclimated to the trimmer which works well but is positioned differently from earlier Brauns.</li>
    <li> This is an outstanding product despite the cost.  For the first time in forty years of shaving with electric razors, I have one that does the job without any need for touch up with a blade.  And the rubber cladding ensures that it will not slip from your hand.</li>
    <li> Shaver works ok, had an older Braun shaver that actualy did a better job of cutting.</li>
    <li> I will tell you what anyone who gave this shaver a bad review must be cracked, I have never been able to use a electric shaver because my beard is so heavy every one I used didn&#x27;t even touch it, just pulled and pinched my hair. I decided what the heak I will try another one. Man this thing is awesome I had about 3 days of stubble this thing went right through it like a hot knife to butter I can&#x27;t believe it this thing it is a little pricey but you know you get what you pay for. If your wondering about its performance don&#x27;t just get it I am glad I did.</li>
    <li> I purchased a Braun Pulsonic Shaver on 11-24-07.  The shave it provided was equal to a non-pulsonic shaver.  On 6-1-08 it broke.  I called their Service Dept. and requested that they send me a new razor.  They said that was not possible and to send it to their approved warranty service shop.  I sent it in on 6-4-08.  On 7-3-08 I called the shop and they said that they were still waiting for parts from Braun.  I called Braun and they said that they were not responsible for the delivery of parts.  BRAUN DOES NOT TAKE CARE OF THEIR CUSTOMERS.  THE BRAUN PULSONIC IS A GOOD PRODUCT IF IT DOES NOT BREAK.  BUY ONE AT YOUR OWN RISK.</li>
    <li> Best electric shaver ever.  Does as promised.  The cleaning system is very nice.  I do feel that it uses a little too much fluid each clean, but that is fine.  The fluid leaves a nice lemon-scented &#x27;oil&#x27; feel to the shaver that helps next time.    Again.. WOW... best shaver ever!  Closer than straight razor</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco shavers since 1992.  When my last  shaver died, I decided to try something new... I went with the Braun Pulsonic Shaver.  Guess what, it is the best shaver Ive ever used.  I cant believe I neglected my face for so long.  It is a beautiful shaver and the shave is close.  One has to use it to appreciate it.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000Q6SU3C Braun Pulsonic System 9595 with LCD Screen]]  This is my third Braun shaver over the years and most certainly the very best. My face is glass smooth after every shave. Do not hesitate to purchase this fine product.     LLF</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned several Braun razors in the past.  Each time I purchased the newest model, I read the reviews about how the \\&quot;new\\&quot; Braun razor was better than all the others.  Usually, I would notice some positive changes.  But this Pulsonic System 9595 truly takes a major step forward.  A very impressive shave from this razor.  Best one I&#x27;ve ever owned without question.</li>
    <li> Amazing product.  If you don&#x27;t let your beard get too long, it is almost better than shaving with razor.  It still does an amazing with long beard, but not as good as when the beard is short. Best on the market.  Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000Q6SU3C Braun Series 7- 790cc (9595) Pulsonic  Shaver]]    This was too much money for the quality of shave I&#x27;m getting. I switched from a Norelco that I had since 2003 and am pretty disappointed. To be fair I&#x27;ve given the razor about two weeks to get used to my face, yet I still am not getting a close shave. If I shave at 5AM, I look like I need to shave again at 10AM and my beard isn&#x27;t that thick. The best advice I can give is save the money and buy a 40-50 dollar shaver. I would return it, but it would be like returning a pair of underwear after wearing them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the unit about a year. My wall adapter just died this morning for no reason. I like the shaver, but am not looking forward to dealing with costumer service and 2-3 weeks to get a replacement that in the end (from what I&#x27;ve read) I&#x27;m going to have to pay for anyways. I might just use a 12v adapter I have for an old CD player. I don&#x27;t get it, wall mount power transformers are nothing new and are supposed to last pretty long. My god, I can still find junkers from the 60&#x27;s that still work fine and have been sitting outdoors for years. Braun should be ashamed for selling out to the cheapest bidder on very standard part...</li>
    <li> I purchased the Braun Pulsonic model 9595 on Amazon for $199.99 a little over a week ago (it apppears the name has changed to 790cc in the interim).  I am also an owner of the Braun model 7680 for comparison.  I believe that the major improvement from my perspective (so far) is that the shaver operates more smoothly, resulting in less/no irritation compared to the 7680.  My perception is that the shave is also nominally faster, closer and more comfortable ergonomically.  It also may be a bit lighter in weight.    To address some of the negative comments: The shaver is louder than my previous model, as is the cleaner, but not enough to bother me (and the cleaner seems to make noise for a shorter duration, at least in the eco mode, which is the only mode used to-date).  As far as the cost of using the cleaner, I think it is worthwhile and have found that cleaning/tapping hairs out of the shaver head before using the cleaning system results in less contamination of the fluid and extends the life significantly.  I expect that washing the head assembly under the faucet prior to using the cleaning system would result in a similar savings.</li>
    <li> I have had a couple of other Braun razors but used them primarily for weekend shaving...they were good but not great.  This Pulsonic is something I use every day...although it still does leave the occasional hair on my neck.  I have sensitive skin and can get burn evven from an electric razor...not with the Pulsonic!  It is a bit pricey but is by far and away the best electric razor I have ever owned.  If you need an electric razor that you can use even if you are a three piece suit wearing professional this is it!</li>
    <li> he isn&#x27;t in love with it (yet anyway).  He has been using it for about a month. It seems to take a little less time to shave but he doesn&#x27;t think the money was worth it compared to this previous model, also a Braun.  Maybe that&#x27;s why; he has been using Braun all along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning is great, it does make a difference in how the shaver performs.</li>
    <li> To start with, I will start with Amazon. This item cannot be returned because it has \\&quot;flammable\\&quot; material. Pretty lame considering I can empty the liquid and send it back. Will be _very_ careful from now on in buying anything from amazon. My local store takes it back, and I wish I had bought it there to try it out. Very disappointed. If you just want to \\&quot;try\\&quot; this shaver(which is probably 90% of the folks), do NOT, I repeat, do NOT buy from amazon.     **Edit** I just remembered that I had searched the entire page for \\&quot;return\\&quot; and did not find it. Now there is a note which says it cannot be returned. Now I am even more pissed off with amazon. This is just clearly a way to make people pay. Shame on Amazon.    Now onto the product. First off, I am an Indian guy, with a pretty hard beard and very quick growth.I HATE to shave, and I would pay anything to get a shaver that shaves my beard well and saves me the agony of shaving with a regular blade. I have tried 3 shavers before, but they ended not shaving correctly or having my skin peeling. I was hoping this is \\&quot;the one\\&quot;, but unfortunately, not. I am writing this review to help out the folks who have a hard beard and skin which is a little sensitive. There were a lot of informative reviews, but I didnt find any reviews that gave me much information.     Let me start with the positives.  1.Much better on my skin. I dont have too sensitive skin(a lil sensitive, all right but not too much), but other shavers I had tried tended to peel the top layer of my skin. I dont mean bleed, I mean just peel, but it was slightly painful and itchy. This one did not ever peel my skin, and I pushed hard.    2. Has the cleaning mechanism, which is AWESOME. I loved it, and I so wish I could use this shaver. Oh well, one day. I am allowed to hope. Maybe Braun will address the Asian/Persian hard beard market someday.     3. For what it did shave, it was closer than any blade I have shaved with. Felt awesome to have such a super close shave. Also better than the Panasonics and Norelco&#x27;s I have tried before. Doesnt peel my skin, and cuts close.    The bad  1. I have go go over the same areas multiple times. It is pretty clean in the end, but some hair is still left over on my cheeks and chin, one hair here, one hair there. I tried different techniques, but it just might be the direction of my growth which is kinda weird. Goes in all directions. So I have to finish up with a blade. Beats the purpose. Its only a \\&quot;few\\&quot; hair, but still..    2. Neck hair. I dont understand why, with all the technology, none of the shavers can do neck hair. it is just painful going over the neck over and over again, and then doing it with the regular blade with my neck stubble. This was one of the deal breakers for me.  My neck was red at the end of a shave and sensitive. And I had to do it with the blade in the end. Why is it so hard to do?     3. If you press too hard to get a close shave, you might get breakouts. I got it after every shave I did.    Hope this helps everyone else. And again, if you want to \\&quot;try\\&quot; this shaver, do NOT, I repeat, do NOT buy from amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the new shaver (Braun 9595)a short time but I find it a great shaver...shaves are really smooth...easy to use and clean. A really  good shaver for anyone looking to purchase one. Highly recommended!!!</li>
    <li> My goodness, this is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned. With my old razor, I would shave for a half hour or more and I&#x27;d have stubble by the end of the day. With this one, I shaved 3+ weeks of beard growth in 15 minutes and three days later I still have hardly any stubble! I used to hate shaving and always had somewhat of a beard, but I think that&#x27;ll change with this new razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It even has an electric display on it that tells you how dirty it is and comes with a cool charging/cleaning station. This is probably the best electric razor available today. When you look at it that way, the $260 price tag is a bargain!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace my Norelco Cool Skin shaver. Had it for years, was happy with it...and then I discovered the Braun...talk about exceptionally smooth, effortless shaving. The closeness of a razor without the pain of a razor. I used this to mow down my heavy beard and was blown away at the comfort, speed at which this works. I&#x27;m taking it with me for a month oversees and look forward to shaving.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver February 2008.  I like the close shave, &amp; the cleaning system.  However, the shaver recently began to strain, &amp; sometimes had difficulty starting, even though the battery was fully charged.  I called Braun customer service, &amp; was informed that repairs would be on me (&amp; not under warranty) if damage resulted from my use of pre-shave (and I do in fact use pre-shave).  This was quite a surprise, as there&#x27;s nothing in the shaver&#x27;s literature that warns against the use of pre-shave (I use Williams Ultra).  Has anyone else had this experience with Braun?</li>
    <li> My son-in-law bought this pulsonic shaver and raved about it, so I bought one for my husband.  He loved it so much that we bought our son one for Christmas.  The razor is expensive but well worth the price.  I do not know how the other series are, but the pulsonic met all \\&quot;my men&#x27;s\\&quot; expectations.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had Braun shavers for ever! Slurged for this one and wish I hadn&#x27;t. The older ones actually shave closer and do that quicker. The HYPE got me! I thought they had actually improved their e-shaver, but they just got marketing-weinies to hype it up and that is all you are buying. Buy the cheaper Braun and you&#x27;ll get a better shave.</li>
    <li> After years of using a Norelco rotary shaver, I decided to \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; to the new Pulsonic line.  I received the 790cc as a Christmas present and have been mostly satisfied with its performance after using it for several weeks.    All the Braun marketing hype surrounding their 7 series shavers is accurate, to a point.  The 790cc beats my older Norelco hands-down.  The shave is closer, quicker and gives my skin way less irritation.  I hardly need to apply after shave to soothe my skin.  While my old rotary was by no means a bad shaver, it often left my entire neck red.  I hardly have that problem with the Norelco.  This is the closest shave I&#x27;ve received with an electric shaver.      The Pulsonic technology definitely helps stand your whiskers on edge.  Provided you follow the customary electric shaver practice of stretching your skin, running the blades against the grain and holding the shaver at a 90-degree angle, you&#x27;ll be more than happy with the results.  That said, it still falls short of a manual wet shave.  Even with the Pulsonic feature, the Power Comb and the locking head, I usually have to go over my neck two or three times for an ideal shave.    The charging and cleaning base station uses a mixture of alcohol, lubricant and fragrance to clean your shaver.  The status indicator on the bottom of the shaver indicates the battery life and hygiene level of the unit, letting you know when its time to cradle the shaver.  The base station automatically selects the necessary cleaning cycle.  Not only is the base station convenient, but it helps reduce skin irritation when you shave by keeping the blades clean, dry and well-lubricated.    For such an expensive shaver, I would have preferred a better carrying case.  The flimsy plastic case provided houses the shaver and a cleaning brush for the road, but no place to put the charger or bottle of appliance oil.  As another reviewer mentioned, the shaver is built extremely well, but the aesthetic choices made by Braun are a little mish-mashed.  The shaver, the base station and the charger are all different colors.  Despite what product pictures may lead you to believe, the shaver&#x27;s LCD display is not backlit, so it can be challenging to read under the direct glare of your bathroom&#x27;s lights.  All these issues are minor and hardly a deal-breaker.    If you&#x27;re looking to save some money, buy the 760cc instead of this particular model.  The only difference is the shaver&#x27;s display indicator (it&#x27;s an LED instead of an LCD) and the base station&#x27;s fast clean feature (there isn&#x27;t one).    I look forward to using my Braun as my primary shaver for years to come.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased and impressed with this razor. I&#x27;ve used 5 different Norelcos during the past thirty years and none of them lived up to their claims of comfort and closeness. I must admit that I always regarded them as the best the market had to offer but the Braun is more than worth the price difference (about double).    I have the dreaded double whammy of a wiry beard and sensitive skin. If I missed a day shaving, the Norelco would cause my skin, especially the throat, to burn all day. When I returned from a recent hunting trip with a week&#x27;s worth of beard, I was amazed that the Braun shave was as comfortable as when I use it daily.  The only thing that could make me more pleased would be if this razor gives me the same reliability and length of service as the previous brand.</li>
    <li> The Braun Series 7 Pulsonic is a definite improvement in quality and in it&#x27;s ability to give a better shave than my older Braun Series 8000 Activator. Time will tell if the new \\&quot;all in one\\&quot; blade and screen cartridge will hold up. That&#x27;s the only thing that I don&#x27;t like. Not being able to see or brush the blades directly make me wonder how clean I&#x27;m getting it when I sometimes run it under water to clean while traveling (new washable feature). Other than that performs well and much less bulky. I like it! Worth the investment after several years of my old Braun.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor when my latest Norelco broke into many little pieces after hitting the floor.  I&#x27;ve owned a few Norelco razors over the years and been pleased with them.  This Braun has impressed, so far.  The razor shaves closer with less effort and a little more comfort than any triple-head shaver I&#x27;ve used.  Nothing is as good as a blade but, this one gets pretty close.  The easy cleaner/charger seems to work as advertised...Its expensive, but I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a complete waste of money.  The razor started off \\&quot;ok\\&quot; but after a couple of months the dock began to not recognize that the shaver was in it so it would not clean or charge.  With some careful maneuvering and propping it will recognize the shaver just long enough to start a cleaning cycle which of course causes it to vibrate and move out of its perfect location.  If I forgo the cleaning and just charge the razor it makes a very high frequency buzz once its done charging that makes it rather uncomfortable to just be in the same room.  This shaver is also big, its not heavy but volume wise its rather substantial for a razor.  Next up is the base which has a few issues with it.  We all know that these small electronics are not powered by 120V and so they are going to need a transformer in them somewhere unfortunately at this price it was unexpected to find it in the form of giant wall wart plug that sticks straight outward rather than 90ing down the wall.  This then feeds into the base which unexpectedly clashes with the razors design.  Now this may seem a bit nitpicky but the razor is a nice silver and black while the stand is solid white.  Not white in a sleek and stylish way but like it looks like they forgot to paint it and shipped it out anyway.  Lastly the only button on the thing is a big one in the middle to activate the cleaning cycles and it feels like a cheap plastic thing that will break the moment the warranty runs out.  All in all a waste of money.  I accidentally hit three stars and Amazon wont let me change it back to a ONE like this product deserves.  Do not buy this razor.</li>
    <li> This is definitely the the Rolls Royce of shavers.      Let me first say that I hated shaving.  I tried numerous electrics but always ended up with the latest \\&quot;safety razor\\&quot;.  Which ever one had the most blades and promised the most comfort.  I never found any of them comfortable and I always broke out or got razor burn.  I disliked shaving so much that I only shaved when I absolutely needed to.      Now that I have the Series 7, I find myself shaving just for the hell of it.  After about the first week or so I have very little, if any, irritation during or after shaving.  It is very convenient being able to shave before showering and its even encouraged.  Prior to using this, in order for me to shave I practically needed an aseptic surgical-like environment.  Now I rub this thing on my face for a few minutes and I&#x27;m out the door.      I think the LCD on the bottom of the razor is kind of overkill.  The information it displays is very vague (just little boxes displaying how dirty the razor is and how much battery life is left) compared to the previous models LCD.  The Series 5 razor had a scrolling text display that actually told you how minutes you had left before the battery died and other important information.  If the LCD is part of your decision making between the 790cc and the 760cc then I would say go for the 760cc.    Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this product to anyone who absolutely dreaded shaving as much as I did.  It takes a little bit longer for a full shave, but if you keep up with the growth its not bad at all.  I would trade an extra 3 minutes off the morning routine for decreased irritability any day.   There is certainly a high price tag but in this case I believe you get what you are paying for.</li>
    <li> I have owned several Braun products now as I have come to appreciate the reliabilty and beauty in all their products.  While I realize they are more expensive and replacement parts aren&#x27;t cheap either, I am willing and in a position to pay that in return for a quality, German made product. I have owned two Braun razors as well as a Braun coffee pot and toothbrush. All have been top notch in terms of reliability, ease of operation, and aesthetic appeal.    Ideally I would like to buy American made products and avoid buying products made in China, however I have come to realize that most if not all of our American manufacturers have opted for better margins and sent production overseas.</li>
    <li> Shave decently, but I expect more from a shaver at this price. Just not worth the money it costs.</li>
    <li> Very good product. A little pricey but it does a very good job of shaving. I would still purchase one.</li>
    <li> One month in, everything with this razor has gone well so far. I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly my face adapted to using the razor (within a week). The shave is very comfortable! It&#x27;s been several years since I&#x27;ve used an electric, so I&#x27;m having to relearn techniques. So far the shave is very close, but it isn&#x27;t super close.     I&#x27;ve found that you do not need to clean the razor every day on the base. I run the cleaning cycle after about 3 uses, and rinse the head under running water every other time without any noticeable difference. This will help the cleaning solution last longer.  One tip, after you rinse the head, let it sit on the counter until it&#x27;s completely dry - don&#x27;t stick it in the base wet.    There are two little things that I&#x27;ve found as small negatives, but all things considered, it&#x27;s still 5 stars in my book. First is the noise - especially in the clean cycle. If you&#x27;re using this early in the morning, it has the potential to wakeup a light sleeper in the next room.  The cleaning cycle isn&#x27;t any louder than normal use, but it reverberates through the counter, etc. The second thing is that I&#x27;m still having a little issue cutting as close on the neck-line - still working on the technique.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000Q6SU3C Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic  Shaver]]I purchased this product after using the older model for about five years. I had changed the head a couple of times and then decided to try the new model series 7 Pulsonic Shaver. I found that however good the old model was, this new one was even better. The shave it produces is as good as a wet razor shave. There is no drag or soreness afterwards and it is quick and cleans up in no time. I must recommend this product with as much strength as I can. I am most pleased with the purchase and the excellent price I obtained through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Decent razor, but why too pricey for what you get. Everything about it is pricey. I prefer my more simple previous razor that didn&#x27;t require cleaning pods. I was hoping this razor would do what it said and shave closer than any other, but sadly my previous $60 razor gave as good, if not better, of a shave.</li>
    <li> I have read some reviews, where the users say their shaver stops working after a while.  Please note that the shaver has two electric contacts on the shaver itself and the cradle, that must be cleaned with a Q-Tip and alcohol monthly to keep grime off them.  If these contacts gets oxidized, then the unit won&#x27;t work.  Sometimes you might have to clean the contacts with some light grit sandpaper or steel wool to get them shiny again...if they are not shiny, then they are not making good electrical contact.  My shaver works great.  It does not always get all the whiskers growing on my neck, so I just use a swipe of a regular razor to get those stray hairs.</li>
    <li> I ended up breaking this on purpose because I had some type of issue but I dont remember what it was.</li>
    <li> I have owned this shaver for over 2 1/2 years and have had problems with base contact and shaver while cleaning; have to move shaver to make contact. Shaver position Lock never worked properly and developed crack in shaver head holder housing. I have had to replace shaving heads too many times. I now trying the Panasonic ES-LA93-K Arc IV</li>
    <li> I like the design and the look of the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Just the cleaning solution is a bit expensive given that it dry out in about 2 months.</li>
    <li> Awesome!  My husband loves this razor!!! He loves the self cleaning aspect and that it is cordless!  Great close shave!!!</li>
    <li> irregular cutting result.  Clean wells but cuts sadly</li>
    <li> My husband loved it.  Unfortunately he passed away so I&#x27;ll give it to my grandson.  It was just what he wanted.</li>
    <li> Nice design, fits my hand and face well.  The cleaning feature seems to do its job, not sure about the cost effectiveness.  Razor does require multiple passes to cut all hair.</li>
    <li> I always thought that the Braun shaver would be a great product, so when my Norelco shaver died I purchased this model.  At first the shaver wasn&#x27;t that great, but the directions said if coming from a rotary shaver you wouldn&#x27;t get great results at first.  After using for three months I still didn&#x27;t see much improvement. I put it aside and used a Gillette razor and shaving cream. I started using the Braun razor again just recently and I am still disappointed in the results. Shaving cream and a razor for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for five years, but let&#x27;s be honest, it&#x27;s mostly a vehicle for the replaceable shaver heads which last 6-8 months before they need to be replaced. Don&#x27;t forget the cleaner packs that need to be replaced every month or two. It&#x27;s probably over-priced considering how many add-ons you will need to buy over time. That being said, the LED read out is nice, the ability to easily clean the shaver makes me do it after every use, which makes it a better shaving experience versus the other electric shavers I&#x27;ve had in the past. As for the vibrations, I have no idea if it&#x27;s that or the shave head itself, but it shaves very close.</li>
    <li> This product is great, the problem is your vendor charged $100 more than what I paid thru Amazon earlier this year. Check my acct to verify. SAMs advertised as improved version and visual was a white cleaner/charger base not the black I was shipped. SAMs offered no assistance and customer service was ........</li>
    <li> Yep, that’s what one British reviewer said about the Braun Series 7 shaver, and he wasn’t kidding. I used to use a Norelco until my beard got just too tough for it. For a while I was at my wit’s end trying to get a close shave. Not even a new shaving head did anything. So I began to do some research on the web. I researched for almost three weeks until I finally discovered this shaver. Wow! Expensive — around $250 — but worth every penny. Incredible technology. It is built entirely on a robotic assembly line in Germany, every one is perfect. It shaves you blade-close, and with no skin irritation. I kid you not. Then, when you’re finished you put it upside down into a special base and press the button on the base. The shaver head starts vibrating and is then flooded by the base with an alcohol/lubricant solution that cleans and lubricates the head to pristine-clean, heat-dries it, and leaves it with a fresh lemon fragrance — wow! I recommend this shaver to everyone — even women, if they need it! ;-)</li>
    <li> Have used the Braun Pulsonic razor for 4 years and love it. Still does a very good job. Quick and smoth. Have to change the cassette head about every 9 months, but that is easy and reasonable. Expensive razor, but will buy another one if this damaged or quits working.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to replace a Philips shaver that I had used for 15 years before it died.  I bought the Braun to give the foil heads a try (as opposed to rotary heads of the Philips).  The shaver worked well for about 2 years.  The part which I am most disappointed about is the cleaning system called &#x27;Clean and Renew&#x27;.  The unit is cheaply made and cleaning solution seems to evaporate rapidly as the seals are not that great.  This means you have to replace the cleaning solution capsule too often.  In addition, the power cord does not sit firmly in the socket on the cleaning unit and thus does not make good contact.  Shaver itself works reasonably well although hair stubbles seem to leak from shaver chamber occasionally even after cleaning. For the price, the unit is a disappointment.</li>
    <li> It better its a Braun shaver, if it didnt I would have sent it back. Five more words required, done</li>
    <li> My husband believes in Braun razors. Because of his age and skin he feels it is next best thing to a barber shave and he can do it himself and look reasonably smooth.</li>
    <li> This is a must buy.  I know the price can be a turn off, but I could not have gotten a much better shave from my razor.  The shave is very very close, fast and clean.  I don&#x27;t have to keep going over certain areas over and over again.  This is the only electric shaver I will ever buy.      If the price deters you, think of all of the shaving cream you won&#x27;t need to buy!!</li>
    <li> Just got my new 9595 Braun in the mail, and even though I have only used it twice I&#x27;m so far impressed. This  shaver replaced my old Norelco James Bond series which the battery started to go after two years. The Braun  9595 cuts better than my old norelco, and does not pull and rip the hairs like the norelco. Another great thing  about the Braun is that after several minutes of shaving it does not get hot on the skin, and the cleaning system  is great, the shaver feels new after it goes through it&#x27;s cleaning cycle. The price is a little steep, but it seems to  be a good foil shaver so far, only time will tell, but I would at least refer this type of shaver to a friend.</li>
    <li> I have been using electric razors for 17 years now and I typically buy a new one every two to three years, to see what advances have been made in the technology.  I have been using norelco all my life, but my wife was complaining about leaving little hairs all around, so I decided to try the more established braun cleaning system.    Big mistake.  I got the razor and it seemed ok at first.  It cleaned successfully a few times, but by the third or fourth time the cleaning system stopped responding to the razor altogether.  If it doesn&#x27;t light up with some status, there is no way to make the cleaning system turn on, so it is entirely wasted.    I should have just returned the product within the 30 days that they allow you to, but I made the next mistake of trying to go through braun customer service.  They told me to send just the cleaning system to a service center.  I sent that in and waited around.  Finally, after a bunch more phone calls, they said I had to send the razor in also, which I did.  Eventually, the service center sent both back to me, saying they couldn&#x27;t solve the problem.  So I called braun again, and they said to send them just the cleaning system.  I pointed out that clearly the problem could be with the razor, since the razor needs to make contact with the system, but they didn&#x27;t care to listen to that.  They sent me a new cleaning system, but it experienced exactly the same problem again.  When I called back again, they refused to replace the razor.  They said I would have to send it to a service center again.  Having already paid shipping to send the products around 3 times, and bought more cleaning fluid to replace what had by now evaporated, I decided it was time to stop wasting my money.  I&#x27;m just going back to norelco, which both makes good products and has good service.    If you ignore the cleaning system, the braun razor itself seems basically ok, but there is no reason to prefer it to norelco.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for two months, and it does a reasonable job.  I still have difficulty getting a close shave in certain trouble spots, but it does a better job in general than any other electric shaver I have used.</li>
    <li> I found the pulsonic liberating. I am constantly looking forward to the next shave. Beard just melts away in a few minutes, without pain. Great.</li>
    <li> To start off I am 41 years old and have been using electric shavers for 25 years. Blade shavers destroy my face and my beard is so tough and thick that they never worked for me.  I have mainly owned Norelco&#x27;s over this time.  The only experience I have had with a foil electric was with cheap Panasonics I bought when I was younger (like $19.99).  Back when I used these they worked very well but the foil would wear down or break too soon and cut me. From there I purely have been using each Norelco or other kinds of lift and cut systems.    The 9595 is my first try at a foil in a long time.  Unlike many reviews here you can look at my history and see my review for the top of the line Norelco that I&#x27;ve had for about 2 1/2 years.  I can say that I was satisfied with the Norelco and if the Pulsonic had not had a good review at Gizmodo.com I would not have even looked at it.  Once I came and started reading reviews I became very interested.  I hate HATE shaving to the point where I usually shave about every 4 days.  I work at home so I don&#x27;t need the \\&quot;office\\&quot; look.  Let me compare the two shavers for a true review of the advantages in the 9595.  First of all when I opened the box and put in the cleaning cartridge I noticed that the cleaner system is about 1000% better and easier than the Norelco system.  The Norelco system requires you to pull apart the case and pour the liquid into a tiny hole - and then screw it shut and put it back onto the base and let the liquid flow in. Also, when you add more liquid you must clean the dissolved hair from the cleaning system.  It&#x27;s messy and a pain in the ass.  However I will say that the cleaning system did make each shave in effect seem like I was using a new razor which is what the purpose was.  Another defect was that it takes forever to clean, and then you must take it out and lay it down to dry (or put it back in the system to rest but that takes longer).  The Pulsonic is designed beautifully.  You take the cartridge and put itin... that&#x27;s the complete effort.  Then when it&#x27;s empty you get a new one.  That alone may have convinced me to get a new shaver - the ease is terrific. Also unlike the Norleco where once it&#x27;s done shaving and charging you have to take it out to get it to stop (make the charge and cleaning lights go off) the Pulsonic cleans and then blow dries it with heat!  No need to ever take it out - it goes off when it&#x27;s done - fantastic.  The one noticable disadvantage of the Pulsonic cleaning system is that it&#x27;s NOISY and it takes much longer.  By noisy I mean SHUT THE DOOR noisy. The Noreclo wasn&#x27;t quiet but this is just LOUD.  So the conclusion for the cleaning system is that it&#x27;s heads and tails better than the Norelco system.  If not for the time and noise it would be 100%.  Onto the shave.  The Norelco was a fairly slow shaver to shave with.  Yes, you could get a close shave with it after about 13-15 minutes but you had to keep going over areas.  Also it was terrible on the neck - it just misses hairs until you go over and over them.  I got so bored with it that I started shaving it with it while browsing on the computer and then finished off in front of a mirror.  Did it do it&#x27;s job?  YES.  Was the shave good?  YES.  But it was slow and took real effort to do a good job.  The only part of my face that I noticed that the Norelco did a better job than the Pulsonic was my lower chin.  And that&#x27;s a review after only one use.  I may learn to get that area better in the future.  Onto the Pulsonic.  Today was my first try with 4 days of beard growth.  heavy and grey in many spots on the chin area.    Let me make one thing clear to those comparing a blade to an electric shaver.  You will ALWAYS get a faster closer shave with a blade.  The blade is ON YOUR SKIN taking the hair and skin off as you shave.  I don&#x27;t know how anyone would think you can get closer than that.  With ANY electric shaver you are going to have to go over areas more than once - it&#x27;s a given and there is noway to avoid it.  So stop saying the blade is closer etc.. of course it is.  The Pulsonic took me about half the time that the Norelco did - about 6 or 7 minutes and this was just my first try.  It does get FAR more hair off on every try and it is WAY faster.  I found that I could shave most areas extremely quickly - I was amazed at how fast it was.  I was blown away at the speed that it took the hair off compared to what I&#x27;ve been using.  Now if I had just gone over my face once with this it would have been just an OK shave.  But you can&#x27;t do that with an electric shaver as I explained.  I found that going over the areas fast a few times got me a very very close shave without missing anything.  The tough areas were the chin and neck - but it still did my neck way way faster than the Norelco.  The Pulsonic really takes the hair off - the power difference is extremely noticable - it&#x27;s like replacing an old lawn mower with a turbo.  There is one negative - and it&#x27;s the same as the negative with the cleaning - it SOUNDS like it&#x27;s powerful.  The noise is about 10 times what my Norelco was making.  It&#x27;s LOUD.  Not just a little loud - real loud - shut the door loud.  As far as the form I found it fit in my hand just fine.  I used it without the lock the first time and I will play with it as time goes on.  Also I noticed that like any other new shaver you need to learn how to shave with it - there is a method.  This should speed up the process and get my a closer shave faster.  How close is the shave compared to the Norelco or any other shaver I&#x27;ve ever used?  WAY closer.  As I said above - just going over it once is not going to do it - go over it until you can feel with your hand that the shave is close.  I asked my wife how my skin felt afterwards and she said it was incredibly close - much closer than anything I&#x27;ve ever used.  In fact I am feeling my face now and I can tell that it&#x27;s the closest shave I ever have had.  Finally the Pulsonic 9595 is a beautiful piece of design and looks more like a small coffee maker than a shaver.  It&#x27;s white with bright blue lights and looks terrific.  Way better than the Norelco system I had.  I would recommend this for anyone who uses an electric shaver who wants a top notch designed system and about the closest shave I think an electric will give you.  If you are considering moving from a blade to an electric then expect to have to put some more effort into getting close.    The plastic carrying case is fine - sure it&#x27;s ugly plastic but who really cares?  The Norelco had a fancy black case but I found it bulky and hard to close.    Ah one last bad thing about the design I just recalled.  The plug on the Pulsonic does not stretch very far. You will need to put the base near the plug because it&#x27;s one of those stretchy cords.  My old Norelco had a standard cord and could be put anywhere on my sink area.  Also the plug on this really sticks out FAR.  I don&#x27;t know the logic they used to make it not flush with the wall but it&#x27;s not even close.  Feel free to post questions.  FYI - I don&#x27;t work for Braun or Norelco. I am a founder and run Toldya.com... a website.  UPDATE!  After owning this since January of 2008 I am finding that it&#x27;s breaking down.  I just had to throw away the cleaning unit because it got clogged up and was leaking the cleaning solution all over the place.  I attempted to clean it out and put a fresh cartridge in but it leaked again.  It&#x27;s not worth it for me to call and get a replacement so I threw it in the garbage.  The shaver still works great but the head doesn&#x27;t move as well and the lock mechanism is cheap and broken.  Hopefully water will clean it well or I will need a new shaver.</li>
    <li> I am one of the hardest people to please and am usually sceptical of other&#x27;s reviews on products.    That being said this shaver is by far the most superior shaver ever. I have tried a lot of other high-end shavers and can honestly say this is the closest shave I have ever got from an electric. Heck, it is pretty close to using a blade! You might be able to get closer with a blade, but it would be so minimally closer than with the Braun that you can&#x27;t tell.    The cleaning system is awesome too! No more cleaning the razor. Just hit the button and the system takes care of itself. No emptying cut hair from the razor...  I love this Braun. It&#x27;s expensive, but worth every single penny!</li>
    <li> I like it, but not as much as my 7526 synchro that I had to replace. It is a little bulky compared to it. I&#x27;m not sure if the 10K vibes thing really does anything or not. The travel case is kind of a joke and is only for the shaver not the the shaver and the power cord.  Was it worth the over $200 I paid, probably not so it better last me four to five years. I like that it can be rinsed out under the water and the battery and hygiene display that tells you when it needs a full clean. Also that you can do a short clean or a long clean is nice compared to my old syncro.</li>
    <li> Best electric razor by far.  This is the second Braun I have owned, very pleased with both, but this one is far superior.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review before, but the reviews on this site helped me make an informed decision on this shaver, and other merchandise, and I want to return the favor.    I am 46 years old and have been using razors my entire adult life. I&#x27;ve tried electric shavers a few times over the years (as recenltly as 6 years ago) and always returned to razors after a few days because the electrics were too unconfortable and didn&#x27;t do an effective job. My hands have become less steady and I reluctantly needed to switch to electric. I did my research and based on the reviews on this site and Consumer Reports settled on the Braun Pulsonic. I received it quickly (Thanks Amazon!) and dreaded using it for the first time based on my previous experiences. I was pleasantly surprised that the shave was comfotable, close, and fast. As close as my razor and with no fear of nicks and cuts. I&#x27;ve been using it a week and so far the cleaning system has been keeping it that way. My expectations have been far exceeded.    Jose</li>
    <li> This razor is the best I have ever used during my sixty year of shaving..as you can see I have used quite a few. I must say that the Braun Pulsonic tops them all.</li>
    <li> I was one of those that could never use an electric razor. Until now! Works well and I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is my first Braun and I am quite happy with the performance. Very smooth and close shave. Comes with a plastic travel case for the electric razor but the recharge/cleaner base is distinctly NOT easily portable: The alcohol cartridge would spill everywhere. It did hold a charge for a 7-day trip I went on so should not be a big worry. All in all remarkable technology in my opinion.</li>
    <li> It works well so far, but I&#x27;m not happy with the cleaning system, I prefer to do it manually. It vibrates and makes more noise than the Norecol.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different electric shavers,and this one is the most comfortable I&#x27;ve tried. I was using a Panasonic ES8077S Vortex which is a good wet shaver, but the Pulsonic 9595 was a dream to shave with dry. It was a super close, gentle shave. A word of advice, if you are a &#x27;Cut and Lift Norelco&#x27; guy I doubt this Foil shaver will please you, but try it, there is a 30 money back guarantee. If &#x27;Foil Shaving&#x27; works best for you, don&#x27;t hesitate to drop the $200 ... it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
    <li> After 20+ years of using Braun and, most recently, Panasonic electric shavers, I decided to take the plunge for the Braun Pulsonic.  WOW!!!  I&#x27;m glad I did.  Because of the price, I had high expectations - it did not disappoint!  I cannot believe how quickly I can now shave...I have tough stubble and it shaves it on first pass.  It&#x27;s quiet, self cleans, and is, without a doubt, the best electric shaver I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> I read lots of great reviews for this razor and ordered it with high expectations. I&#x27;ve been using it for about three weeks now and I have to say that I&#x27;m not nearly as impressed as everyone else seems to be. Maybe I got a bad unit or something. It feels nice in the hand and it seems quite powerful and the pop-up trimmer works great. But I&#x27;m just not getting a very close shave at all with it. I have to go over all parts of my face and neck two or three times, stretching the skin in every way possible, and even then I still find areas that could have been closer.  I really wanted to like this razor, especially because it&#x27;s so expensive. I&#x27;ve had great Braun razors before, but this isn&#x27;t one of them. I&#x27;m sorry that I can&#x27;t agree with everyone else on this one.  BTW, I&#x27;m sure that part of the reason this razor is so expensive is because Braun really overdid the packaging. You&#x27;d think the packaging was for some precious family heirloom or valuable jewels, not an electric razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned many electric razors over the years, all rotory (Norelco). I stopped using them as they just couldn&#x27;t get the job done giving me a close shave, especially in the tough areas such as the neck. I was skeptical at first, but after the rave reviews I read here on Amazon, and the consumer reports, I decided to give the Braun Pulsonic a try. In short, it is the best electric razor I have ever owned. It shaves every bit as close as the Gillette Fusion razor. I actually look forward to shaving. I usually don&#x27;t shave during the weekend, but now my wife thinks somthings up because now I do. I wholeheartedly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a great electric shaver for years and have gone through a few, always returning back to a razor because the electrics just could not compete.  That time is at an end -- this electric razor is fantastic!  It gives about 95% of what a razor can do, without the hassle of cuts, irritation and the mess.  Thank you Braun, you have made my mornings easier.</li>
    <li> Works nas advertised-perhaps better. Perhaps because I am lazy, I just love taking the razor from the stand, shaving and then returning it to the stand. As I leave the bathroom the razor is being cleaned,charged and ready for my next shave.</li>
    <li> I am 77 years old and have been using electric shavers for over 50 years. This shaver is without a doubt the best of those I have owned. It gives a very close shave without irritation to my face which is a first for me and I highly recommend it without reservation.</li>
    <li> After reading the glowing reviews I decided to go for one of these. As others mentioned it comes rather \\&quot;overpackaged\\&quot; but once removed from the box it seems like a nice unit in the hand. However my first shave was a disappointment - it shaved but it wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;amazing\\&quot;, just average. I was feeling like I had wasted my money but continued to use it over the next week and then the magic happened - as my beard got used to the shaver it shaved closer and closer. Now it is without a doubt the best shaver I have ever used - truly as close as a blade.    So even if you are used to using Brauns (as I was) you need to give your face a little time to get used to this different shaver - the wait is worth it.</li>
    <li> Got this shaver a couple of weeks ago, and love it. I had used the Braun Activator model up to now, which was good, but did leave my skin a bit sensitive at times when I was in a hurry. This Braun is totally different in that my skin is much happier after I shave with this Braun than with anything prior. I think that is because the pulses move the head so fast that there is no time for the shaver to \\&quot;pull\\&quot; the hairs and create the sensitivity. The shaver feels great in the hand with its smaller diameter and L-Ion battery that cuts the weight to less than my previous Braun. It just feels really great to hold and use. The LCD readout of the battery and hygiene status is also very helpful.     I nearly always use alcohol-based after-shave and cologne after shaving, and in the past that stung sometimes a lot depending on the way I shaved, how fast, when I last shaved, etc. With this Pulsonic, to me it feels as if there is no alcohol in my post-shave liquids since my skin is so much less irritated after shaving with this. That alone is worth the upgrade! I love the \\&quot;full suspension\\&quot; of the heads as they float over the bumps and ridges of one&#x27;s face and neck, and keep the head more gently pressed against my face when moving the shaver around my beard.    I have always hated shaving and still do, but this Braun makes that chore about as painless as I&#x27;ve ever experienced to date. I still have my old Braun as a backup or emergency shaver, but after using this one it would be hard to go back even to that excellent shaver. This pulse thing takes shaving to a whole new level, and is truly a lot more than a marketing gimmick which is what I usually think of when I see the word \\&quot;new.\\&quot; This truly is a new way to shave that may be the standard for years to come.    I will mention that it did take about a week before my face got used to the new Braun, even though I had used an older Braun up to that point. Now that my face and Braun have gotten well acquainted, my shave now is closer and faster than the first time I used it. Or maybe I&#x27;m just learning how to use it more effectively. I think that one needs to let their face and shaver get to \\&quot;know\\&quot; each other for a week or two before making a judgment as to quality of shave.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this new madel Braun razor. I have owned several Braun shavers before, most recently one of the 8000 series. The overall quality of this model is well below that of the 8000 series. The fit and finish is poor and the razor doesnt dock well with the base. It took three times for me to even get it to charge. I would suggest saving the extra $100 and going with the 8000 series.</li>
    <li> Without a doubt the best foil electric razor on the market!!!!  Super smooth mechanism and a relative quiet shave gives this unit high marks.  Price is a bit on the steep side but if you prefer an electric over a blade, do yourself a favor and buy this. Cleaning system and charging base is 1st rate.</li>
    <li> Switched from Norelco about 20 years ago and have been using Braun shavers ever since. Used safety and even straight razors before that.  Was using a 5000 series before the Syncro and most recently the Activator.  The Syncro was good, but the foil design of the Activator was more effective getting the stray hairs from my lower jaw and neck area.  The Clean &amp; Charge is a good feature of both the Syncro and Activator and, although I don&#x27;t like the cost of the cartridges, is one reason I stayed with Braun when I purchased the Pulsonic.  It&#x27;s nice to have a clean and charged shaver every morning with such little effort.    I expected good things from the Pulsonic, and have not been disappointed.  I have to say it was not very impressive, compared to the Activator, for the first couple of days and I was thinking it was going back.  I thought since I have been using Braun shavers for so long that there was not going to be a learning period for my beard. There was no transition period for me when switching from the Syncro to the Activator. Not so for the Pulsonic...I noticed much better performance on the third and fourth days.  Even on the first day, I thought the Pulsonic provided a more comfortable shave than the Activator.   The Activator never was uncomfortable or caused a rash or abrasion, but the design of the floating head on the Pulsonic is better.   I could barely hear the whiskers being trimmed with the new cutter.  But even after going over the same areas in different directions, for the first couple of days, I could not seem to get all the stubble.  I could run my fingertips over those areas and still feel some of the uncut hairs.  I followed up with the Activator for the first three days and got the smoother shave on the first two days.  After that, I have not been using both shavers.  Both shavers provide very close and smooth shaves in a reasonable amount of time, but already I will have to say the Pulsonic seems faster.  Now, less than two weeks since I started using it, I&#x27;m planning on keeping the Pulsonic.      Other shavers under consideration are new models from Norelco and Panasonic.  Of the two brands, I was inclined toward the Panasonic because of the foil and cleaning system.   The second model from the top in the Panasonic line (ES8109S) is made in China (not sure where the nearly identical ES8228S is made) and, although it boasts the fastest rpm, it sounds like it takes a long time to get a close shave according to the reviews I have read.  The cheaper Panasonic may be an excellent value, but the top of the line is in the same price range as the Pulsonic (after discounts).    I prefer the handling characteristics of the Pulsonic over the older Braun models.  The grip is more contoured and the surface is more non-slip compared to the bulkiness of the Syncro and Activator.  The trimmer of the Pulsonic is different than  the excellent trimmers on the older models, but may be just as good once I get used to it.  The noise from the Pulsonic is slightly louder and higher pitched from the slower Activator, but not objectionable.  My best suggestion for those considering the purchase of this shaver is to follow the instructions.  Shave before washing your face or showering and give the new shaver at least two weeks of daily use to see if it&#x27;s right for you.</li>
    <li> The 9595 Shaving system shaves better than any one I have had before.  The Clean and Renew is a must, which gives your shaver a lemon scent every time you use it.</li>
    <li> So i have been using the Norelco Speed XL shaver for over a year now and it is great. After seeing this fancy Braun pulsonic and reading all the great reviews on it i thought i should buy it and give it a try. So after a few days of using it i wasn&#x27;t all that impressed with it. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, i think the braun is a good product, but for those who have had the norelco experience they think that the braun is inadequate. If you check the reviewers that gave this thing a 1 or 2 star you see that they are displeased because they are all Norelco users.     So the Pro for the Braun:   --Holds a charge for a long time  --attractive looking product with a beautiful LCD   --cleans itself nicely    Cons:  --the pulsonic makes it much louder than the norelco  --not a close shave compared to the norelco  --much more expensive than the norelco speed xl    Overall, the Braun does a good job compared to a lot of shavers out there, but definitely not a close shave compared to the Norelco speed-xl</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with electric razors for over 20 years, and I&#x27;ve always had problems with razor-burn around my jaw and neckline despite trying several popular preshave products and razors. However, about a month ago, I&#x27;ve finally decided to spring for a Braun Pulsonic 9595, and I&#x27;m happy to report I no longer have any problems with razor-burn. This is a wonderfully close-shaving electric razor--it even has a special central strip in its head that will cut through a thick, multi-day shadow with no painful pulling or pinching. None of the other dozen or so electric razors I have tried over the years have ever managed to do this! The self-cleaning feature is also very useful and impeccably cleans the inside of the razor foil; the cleaning solution tanks are reasonably-priced if purchased as a three-pack, and my first tank is still mostly full after a month of use with daily cleanings. The razor also comes with a well-made plastic carrying case for travelling purposes, and this is the best-packaged razor I have ever seen. My only critique is the somewhat awkward location of the flip-up sideburn trimmer--if you&#x27;re not careful, the active razor foil might give you an unintentional haircut while you&#x27;re trimming your sideburns. If you have thick &amp; rapidly-growing facial hair, problems with razor-burn, or desire a close shave, I believe you&#x27;d greatly benefit from this high-quality razor.</li>
    <li> I am using the shaver now for 4 months. The shaver itself works very well. I like especially the cleaning station which leaves the shaver in top condition and completely clean from the inside. I am wondering however if the daily charging that comes with each cleaning is not draining the capacity of the battery more rapidly. I hope the charger is a trickle charger. The cleaning solution lasts for almost exactly one month, also as advertised.    Ok, so why am I giving this unit only 1 star? Because the power adapter failed me after 4 months and the rigid service system Braun has behind its products is not acceptable by a long shot. The $215 shaver comes with a 2 year warranty that covers parts like these. Unlike many other companies who sent you a new replacement/exchange part in a matter of 2-3 business days after asking a few questions on the phone, Braun gives you the run-around. First you need to call the central service line, where your concern is simply noted. You are then forwarded to a local/regional service center that actually needs to looks at the unit. These are little shops to which Braun has outsourced the actual repair. No big thing I thought. By connecting the power adapter directly to the shaver it became clear right away that the power adapter was broken (no blinking of segments).  In my case my closest service center was in Woodland Hills with the encouraging name \\&quot;Speedy Appliances\\&quot;. Luckily I decided to not follow the advice of the central Braun service to send the entire unit including shaver to that location. Instead I drove the 15 miles down there on a sunny morning, hoping I could leave with a new adapter. Sure enough the staff there determined in 1 minute that the unit was indeed broken and that this would we a warranty case. Without looking anywhere in his store he said that he would need to order the adapter. It turned out that that it would take about 2-3 weeks and that the adapter would first need to be shipped to his store and then he would ship it to my address adding another few days to it. There was no way that the unit could be drop shipped directly to me. When calling the central Braun line the next business day asking them if this of-the-shelf adapter could not be shipped directly, I got the same \\&quot;we are not flexible\\&quot; approach. Any warranty part needs to go out to the service center first. Alternatively I could order the unit also directly from the parts center in which case it would ship directly to me, but I also would need to pay for everything.   Afterwards I called the parts line directly to see out of curiosity what the power adapter costs and how long it takes them to ship to me: $21 plus $5 S&amp;H, in stock, could be there in 5-7 business days.  If Braun would use batteries that last 4-6 weeks I would give them all the time in the world to work in the archaic, snail-paced service world, but the battery lasts about 1.5 weeks if used daily. And daily use is the whole idea behind a shaver and many other Braun products isn&#x27;t it...  Luckily I still have my older high-end Norelco, who will serve me well while Braun gets my adapter mailed around the US. So, don&#x27;t toss your old unit yet if you decide to buy this product. You might need it sooner rather than later.</li>
    <li> The shaver is unreal as a dry shaver. I have a stiff hard to shave beard also fairly recently had voice box removed and have a stoma. Some tender areas on the neck as a result. This shaver is soft on my skin, shaves CLOSE, quick, and gets into hard to reach areas, (such as a dip I have above my Stoma). I have nothing but praise for it. I actually enjoy shaving with it. Cleaning unit is very good.  I also have a Braun 360 Complete shaver which is good but I rate this one better. Cuts a bit faster and the head swivels smoother and further. Would I recommend it to a friend? Oh Yes. One of my better buys.</li>
    <li> I have been blade shaver all my life but 9595 has changed that for good. It is closest shaving to blade with super comfort and ease. I have been using it for 2 months now and it is absolutely magnificent.</li>
    <li> I was a norelco guy for the past 10 years, I&#x27;m asian american and my facial hair doesn&#x27;t grow much so i can usually get away with shaving once a week. W/ the norelco even after changing out the blades it would sometimes &#x27;pull&#x27; my hair.     First time i used the Braun it felt like a facial massage, I did have to go over the same area a few times more w/ the braun but it was deff more comfortable. Also the hygiene and battery meter is great.     I still open up the head and give it a nice brush after each shave. only down side to this is the continuous cost of buying the cleaning agent.      I love this shaver.</li>
    <li> I am one of those individuals who use an electric shaver out of necessity, rather than just personal preference. From time to time, I have used razor blades, disposable or high-end, only to have my face transformed into something looking like hamburger. Call me a baby face if you like, but electric shavers have been the only shaving device that have kept my morning shaving routine from resembling some sort of torture session.    Consequently, I have gone through 25+ years of adulthood going from one electric shaver to the next; always with the hope for that perfect shave, but always left wanting. Having said that, Braun shavers have always been my default electric shaver. While I have occasionally tried other brands, I always found myself coming back to Braun and their reliable foil shavers; they always seemed to outperform all the others.    While Braun shavers \\&quot;got the job done\\&quot;, they too had their shortcomings: they always seemed to 1) leave me with that occasional razor burn, 2) be unable to closely shave those one or two awkward places on my face, and 3) take too long to get the job done - sometime requiring several passes across the same place to get an even reasonably close shave. But having tried multiple electric shavers, I had convinced myself that this was as good as it was going to get. However, I continued to hold out hope that something better might eventually come along...    Enter the Braun Pulsonic 9595! After reading several of the reviews of this shaver, I was intrigued. However, to say that I suffered from sticker shock, would be an understatement. \\&quot;Surely no electric shaver could possibly be worth that kind of money, could it?\\&quot; Following several months of mental debate and calisthenics, I finally decided to take the plunge about three months ago. \\&quot;Could this finally be the one?!\\&quot;    In short, yes, it could and it is! This shaver is different than anything else I have ever used. The pulsonic technology is not just a marketing gimmick, it really works. Here&#x27;s been the impact: razor burns have been non-existent, my daily shaving time has been decreased by a third, and close shaves have become the norm, rather than the exception. Let me provide a few specifics and personal recommendations.    The owner&#x27;s manual, similar to most Brauns, recommend using the shaver before washing your face. That may work for some people, but not for me. Washing my face, then allowing at least 15 minutes for it to completely dry has provided the most comfortable and close shave. Second, pressing harder with this shaver actually makes it less effective. I know this is counter-intuitive, but it must have to do with the pulsonic technology. So, if you encounter a patch of whiskers or a certain part of your face that is particularly uncooperative, make a light pass across the area with the shaver. If your experience is like mine, you&#x27;ll be amazed that the hair instantly disappears.  Over time, I&#x27;ve gradually trained myself to shave, while applying less pressure with the shaver. This has resulted in quicker and closer shaves!    This is the first time I have owned an electric shaver with a cleaning system. The LCD screen indicates the shaver needs to be cleaned after about every three shaves, even though the charge lasts for 5-6 shaves. Consequently, I usually wait until the battery needs to be charged before I clean it. However, I remove the foil screen head after each shave and tap-out the razor stubble. This routine has worked just fine, while extending the \\&quot;life\\&quot; of the cleaning fluid. After almost three months, the electronic level indicator still shows the fluid level as \\&quot;high\\&quot;. If you&#x27;re a clean freak, you can clean your shaver more frequently (I&#x27;ve read several reviews from people who do so after every shave), but I believe it&#x27;s overkill. Besides, you&#x27;ll buy considerably more cleaning fluid.    Bottom-line: When it comes to my morning shaving routine, I feel like I have finally arrived! While I am not sure that shaving could ever become pleasurable, this shaver has at least removed the dread from this daily task. Moreover, I can&#x27;t imagine there is another electric shaver on the market that provides a better, quicker and more comfortable shave. I know my wife is probably tired of hearing, \\&quot;Have I told you how much I like this shaver?!\\&quot; This electric shaver is simply the best!</li>
    <li> I have tried every electric shaver there is, and none will compare to this one.  I simply is the best there is.  It will need the usual two to three weeks to get used to.  It is worth the extra money in every respect.</li>
    <li> I have had several different electric razors. This one beats them all for closeness and ease of care and cleaning.</li>
    <li> Awesome razor - good buy for what you get.  My face has never been this smooth and I&#x27;m a grandpa.</li>
    <li> A great machine.  Pros:   - Pretty close shave  - Great design, easy grip, pretty  - Self-clearing feature works great.  Cons:  - Don&#x27;t expect it to be as close as a manual razor.</li>
    <li> This is my third braun shaver in the last 15 years. they just keep getting better. this one shaves very close and very fast. the only thing is, it seems to use the cleaning fluid a lot faster then the last model. You need to clean the unit every 3 or 4 shaves. I had to change the cartrige after a month and the old unit lasted twice as long... Waiting to see how long the cutter head lasts and costs to replace .... but its a AAA unit</li>
    <li> Over the last 20 plus years I have owned at least 5 different Braun shavers and a couple of Norelcos.  One or two in the bunch were noteworthy.  All I used more than a year.  I read these positive reviews with sceptisim to say the least.  I bit the bullet and ordered this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bar None this is the Best razor that I have ever used.  It provides the closet, quickest shave of any of the Braun&#x27;s I have owned in the past.  In fact it gets so close that there is a spot under my nose that appears I waxed my face!  That is a bit irritating and somewhat surprising.  I have to stop shaving for a few days to let the hair grow back to even out my normal 5 O&#x27;clock shadow.  Get this, I actually look forward to shaving now.  Previously I needed to touch up my face with a blade (dry) to get those hard to shave spots under my jawline right by my ears and on my neck.  This razor gets them all with no trouble.  Simpy amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all electric razors daily use is critical to get them to work well.  Second tip-Do not wash your face before shaving.  Third tip-Do not shave first thing in the morning as the face is swollen from sleep and needs time to return to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use an electric shaver, even though this one is pricey it has been absolutley the best I have owned.</li>
    <li> I had used a traditional 3 headed Norelco electric shaver for over 10 years and was used to the quality of shave it provided not knowing how close a real electric shaver could shave.  Then I tried the Braun Series 7 shaver and my face has not felt so smooth since I was a kid!  I have received a couple of complements on my smooth skin from girlfriends too which is an added bonus!  I highly recommend this shaver and will not return to the Norelco!!</li>
    <li> It worked fine for 11 months.  Went to shave and it was dead even though it had been charging for most of the day.  I researched and found other people had same problem.  I am dreading the hassle I know awaits me of trying to get this fixed.  Sorry Braun, for years I used your products but $200+ for 11 months can by me a lot of disposable razors.  Before buying read the reviews (1 star and 2 star) to balance out the higher scores.  I rated it highly too, at first.</li>
    <li> I decided to upgrade from my 3-year old Braun Activator 8585, since that one missed occasional long hairs and stubble, particularly under the chin and around the jawline.  Furthermore, it was never that close of a shave (you could still see/feel stubble), and it occasionally caused irritation, especially when I used the cleaning solution daily (instead I switched to monthly).      Having used this 9595 top-of-the-line shaver for a couple of weeks now, I must say I am a little disappointed.  The end result is not noticeably better than the Activator, yet I just spent about $200.  On the other hand, the new design and feel of the shaver is nice, but probably not alone worth shelling out another $200.    FYI, I ended up returning it directly to Braun (using their 60 day (?) money back guarantee), and I received a prompt full refund as promised, even though I had used it for almost 60 days.</li>
    <li> The Positives:  This shaver looks great, feels great and very solid in your hand(well built), and the battery seemingly lasts forever without needing a recharge.  It also has a lot of power and never bogs down even the slightest bit no matter how fast you try to shave with it or how thick or long the hair is.  I also like the fact that it cleans itself and always smells lemony fresh after a cleaning.  If you take your time with the shave, you can get a decently close shave, although nothing like a real razor.  I find I get the best shave with this razor if I go very slowly over each spot, and go over the same spot several times against the grain but at different angles.    The Negatives:  This razor will actually give you little cuts sometimes on the lower parts of your neck.  It doesn&#x27;t do it all the time, but it does it enough to make me be very careful of it when shaving near my adams apple.  Surprisingly, despite it being able to cut you, it often manages to miss hairs right next to where it made the minor cut... which seems odd to me, since the hairs are raised up higher than the skin that it cut.  The cleaning solution for this device is quite expensive and can really add up over the course of the year(if you shave every day, you&#x27;ll go through a single cleaning cartridge once every 35 to 50 days).  I generally have to put it into cleaning mode every other shave, and it takes quite a while to finish the cleaning cycle.. during which the thing turns on and off repeatedly while inside the cleaning base.  This razor is extremely loud in general and is extremely loud throughout the approximate 15 minute duration of the cleaning.  The cleaning is soo loud that I actually had a house guest get annoyed enough by it to go into the other room and stop it mid-cycle once because she couldn&#x27;t sleep with it going on.  There are some hairs on parts of the neck that this thing occasionally just will not pick up and cut.  I find that if I do a shave with this razor and then pick up my old 3-circle Norelco razor and do a quick pass over the section where it missed those hairs... the Norelco one instantly cleans up all the missed hairs on the first pass.    Considering how much this thing costs, It&#x27;s not worth the money.  My next razor will be another one of those razors with the 3-cutting circles on the head.</li>
    <li> I have been a razor user most of my life but I find the Braun Series7-790cc Shaver an excellent product. It produces a shave as close as any razor I have used and requires no lather and wash. I do use a pre shave product which makes for a smoother and less irritating shave but even without that product the shaver performs well. One does have to replace the cleaning solution cartridges occasionally but this is very easily performed and not costly. I would buy this shaver again.</li>
    <li> I periodically use electric shavers at home and when traveling and have owned many different brands. I now only purchase Braun shavers. This Series-7 is the best of  the Braun models yet. I highly recommend this model.</li>
    <li> Even better than advertised if you don&#x27;t use the wasteful, expensive cleaning solution. Buy a 5 cent brush, pop off the shaver heads, and brush clean.</li>
    <li> Lasted only 3 years and 3 months and then DEAD.&lt;br /&gt;As a top of the range, leading edge shaver it did give a good shave. Bought it in March 2009, the initial foil lasted till August 2010 ( 17 months use) until the foil actually wore through and severely scratched my face without any warning.  I replaced the foil with a Genuine Braun replacement head/foil at a cost of $AUD95. It then continued to work Ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that the Braun Cleaning system clogs up and does not perform as you would expect. You have to regularly check that the hole that returns fluid back into the cleaner cartridge does not get blocked as mine did and there is no warning.  This means that the Foil/head is not cleaned by the Braun Cleaning system and its  expensive cleaning solution. I found I had to check if the foil/head is clean after using the Braun Cleaning system (after every 4 shaves) and found I had to manually clean/brush the foil more after completing the normal Cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shaver Display gave the warning that the Foil was due to be replaced soon after 18 months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now after 3 years and 3 months of use, 39 Months (approx every 2-3 days) it has stopped working and will not operate on either Battery Mode or connected direct to AC power. The Display works and shows that the batteries are fully charged.  Looks like it has gone to the \\&quot;high tech, early obsolescence\\&quot; graveyard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The previous shaver I had was also a Braun, lower in the product range and lasted 7 years but with only weekend use as I used blade razors during the week for a closer shave. The batteries stopped charging after about 5 years, but the razor still worked when connected direct to AC power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have complained to Braun about the poor useful life of this product and am now waiting their response.  I would not recommend this product to anyone unless Braun acknowledges they have a product reliability problem and replace it under a statutory \\&quot;Fit for Purpose\\&quot; warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I do not get a satisfactory response from Braun and now have to purchase a new shaver after such a short product life, it will certainly not be a Braun due to this appalling service life.</li>
    <li> Like others over 50 I had it with electric shavers was ready to go back to Mach5.  Gave this a try and was the best and quickest shave ive ever had.  Usually my neck is very sensative and I hate shaving it with my old electric tugging out the wiskers, well no more!  Smooth as a babys butt!  Now the down side...  790cc initial cost SALE price $200.  Clean and renew SALE price $32.24 for 6 FREE shipping add after 18 month as they recommend changing the foil/shaver $40 SALE price.  For those that dont know you can use the Clean and Renew which is alcohol with a lubricant in it and that will last 30 days and Braun says a max of 8 weeks before it would everapate from the air.  Now you can use water to clean it and have the hassle of air drying it, Braun even gives you oil to oil your shaver if you use water to clean it then once a week needs oiling.  The clean and renew recharger/cleaning station with clean and renew in it cant go on planes since it is so flamable they even have to ground ship it to you.  LOVE the shave best ive ever had but I figure the cost of this is $12+ a month figuring a shaver life of 36 months and changing the Clean and Renew once a month.  So thats it the BEST at a COST! Now you know the rest of the story!</li>
    <li> In setting the rating (number of stars), I had a bit of a quandary:  IF I were rating it against all the other electric razors I have ever had, I would give it all 5 stars.  However, I am rating it against what I would like to see as an ideal razor, which I guess does not exist.  The ideal razor would shave as close as a blade WITHOUT requiring multiple passes over one&#x27;s skin.  This one falls far short of that.  However, I have had Remington and Norelco in the past, and this one beats them significantly, both in ability to handle a tough beard and in comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this razor for only about 2 weeks now, so can&#x27;t say anything about longevity.  IF you have a wimpy beard, you may be happy with a much less expensive razor.  If you have a tough beard and have been frustrated by other razors (and if you are not expecting perfection), I do highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> As a point of comparison, my previous shaver was an ancient Norelco 6826XL. I&#x27;ve preferred rotary razors for years, but the battery in my Norelco was dying (and unlike, say, an iPod, when the battery in a shaver dies, you can&#x27;t even get it replaced by the manufacturer) and I&#x27;d heard that linear shaver technology had advanced, so I thought I&#x27;d try the Braun.    In terms of the quality of the shave, it&#x27;s not as good as a manual razor. It doesn&#x27;t even give me a better shave than my old Norelco, and it takes longer, requires more facial manipulation, and makes a lot more noise than the Norelco. I can&#x27;t see any particular benefit from the touted vibrating head. Perhaps it&#x27;s very slightly more effective at picking up difficult hairs, but I&#x27;m not even sure of that.      Nevertheless, while it is slower and louder than my Norelco, I&#x27;m reasonably satisfied with my purchase, because the cleaning system really does work as advertised. Although the head of my Norelco could be rinsed under running water, to get a really good shave I nevertheless had to disassemble it every couple of weeks and clean the half-dozen fiddly little parts with a brush. The Braun, on the other hand, does indeed seem to give an \\&quot;as new\\&quot; shave consistently if I run the cleaning cycle regularly. That&#x27;s a good thing, because while it still comes with a little brush, there&#x27;s not much you can do with it--the cutters are part of a sealed monolithic head module (which probably means greater expense if it is damaged or worn out, but that hasn&#x27;t happened yet). Moreover, I experience less facial irritation with the Braun, probably because the alcohol-based cleaning solution reduces bacterial contamination. The cleaning cycle is noisy, but actually less so than shaving, because it is muffled a bit by the stand--although it can be disconcerting to hear the thing buzzing away in the bathroom with nobody in there. Disadvantages are that the cleaning solution leaves a residue on the head that smells bad--and tastes even worse if I happen to get it on my lips. And of course you have to periodically replace the cleaning solution (which lasts about a month, as advertised). You can rinse it under running water, which is fine for a short trip. The battery charge is good for over a week--at least now while it&#x27;s still fairly new--and all you need to recharge it is the wire; you can leave the base at home. But I find that running the cleaning cycle regularly gives the best shave.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor!! This is my second purchase of this item.  I bought one as a gift for my husband last year and we have absolutely no problems with it, the shaver has outperformed every razor my husband has ever used.  It is easy to use, easy to clean and just does it&#x27;s thing, flawlessly.  My dad, visiting us this year, agreed, so we purchased another for him this holiday.  Can&#x27;t say much more about our satisfaction except you will NOT be disapointed - well worth the price!</li>
    <li> Gave the Pulsonic to my son-in-law for Christmas.  He says it has cut his shaving time in half.</li>
    <li> The best Shaver that I have ever brought. It just amazed me at how great it could be</li>
    <li> Today is day three shaving with my new Braun Series 7.  I had been shaving with a top of the line Panasonic, using it with Foamy, and pretty well convinced that I couldn&#x27;t get a better shave.     What eventually made me want to try a different shaver (again) was that the Panasonic was so noisy that it really bothered me.  I was using clipper oil to tone down the noise but it seemed to reach a point where it wasn&#x27;t helping.    This was not the first time I had tried a different shaver. The last time the Panasonic noise got to me I bought a Norelco.  That was two years ago and I returned it after one day. I loved how quiet it was but it didn&#x27;t give me a close shave (ah...but the quiet was nice).    The Braun is almost unbelievable.  It&#x27;s quiet and I&#x27;m shaving in half the time, getting a shave that is so close it makes me almost look forward to shaving. I shave my neck with no problem...all whiskers gone. I can&#x27;t get over this. I find myself checking my face during the day for stubble. None, as in none! Oh...and no break-in time. My expectations were so low going into this purchase that I called Braun just to verify that the \\&quot;60-day return policy\\&quot; was a fact.    I&#x27;ll tell you, my expectations were high for this Series 7 thing, but I would never have thought that a great shave could be gotten this comfortably. Oh, and about the replacement cartridges, I&#x27;m glad to buy a new one every single month for the rest of my life! If it&#x27;s a con, so what. I&#x27;m still happy to make the monthly purchase.    The only negative is the LCD at the bottom of the shaver. It could have used a backlight.</li>
    <li> Had a 5 series that broke.  New shaver does better in some areas and worse in others than the old one.  Overall, I am happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Here is my two cents:  Nothing is as close or leaves skin as smooth as a razor.  Having said that, and after owning an older Braun (5000 series?) in which i used for several years before upgrading to the Pulsonic - I find that the new Pulsonic does not do any better than my old one.  The Pulsonic is suppose to have a \\&quot;new &amp; improved\\&quot; shaving head,  but I can&#x27;t tell.  I have been shaving with the Pulsonic now for almost a month, in which Braun states it takes 2-3 weeks for your facial hair/skin to adjust, and is still does not do my neck area good.  Before the Braun&#x27;s, I used a Norelco for about a year and after getting use to it, it seemed to shave closer including the neck area.  Considering the price (paid $180 for mine), I would recommend a cheaper Braun or Norelco.</li>
    <li> Best shaver I have used lately on the market but it is nothing like the marketing.  I want something that shaves a lot closer and completely takes out the hair.  I hope someday there will be laser type shavers that remove the hairs completely for a smoother feeling... as long as it does not hurt too much :)</li>
    <li> I want to say thanks to Mr. Randy Dorfman.. I am TOO LAZY/Busy to write a review, but after I read his review I felt I was reading myself!.. And after trying the Pulsonic, I felt a compromise to share my extremely satisfactory experiencie.    I shave for almost 15 years with electrics, all of them PHILIPS (had about five models aver all this years); this is THE BEST shaver I&#x27;ve ever had, finally I tried a BRAUN thanks to Mr. Randy&#x27;s comment.    My neck is EXTREMELY sensitive, with all the Philips I had (even my newest) everyone asked me if I have allergy for the full day I shaved.    The instructions say that if you have shaved with rotary/conventional shavers, you have to get used to the braun after 2-3 weeks, well, I should say I was somewhat skeptical (for my previous experience, always expecting that with the \\&quot;newest\\&quot; philips my problem would end); but my FIRST shave with the pulsonic was done almost in HALF the time of my previous shaver (no kidding, no exxageration), and the BEST part, ZERO irritation!.    I can&#x27;t belive I am writing this, but as Mr. Dorfman says in his review, now I ACTUALLY ENJOY Shaving!.    Go for it, I promise you wil not regret!.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally leave reviews for products on Amazon, but every once in a while there comes along a product that is so amazing that I want to shout about it from the mountaintops.    When I first used the Braun 7 Series (hereafter referred to as \\&quot;B7\\&quot;) I was startled by the raw power of the B7. They say the B7 produces 10,000 microvibrations a minute. It&#x27;s true. I felt every one of them.     The smoothness afterwards is unparalleled in the world of electric razors. With my old razor, shaving was a chore. Sometimes I would let my hair grow out a day or two. Now I shave at least once a day, just for that feeling aftewards.    If you value the feeling of a close shave without the hassle of a regular razor the B7 is a MUST buy.</li>
    <li> Had been using norelco and the shaver is a bush hog comparing the two shavers and the Norelco was merely a whimp when it came to shaving.Great Buy also</li>
    <li> The Braun Pulsonic is just like any other electric shaver out there... the self cleaning feature is nice... but I wish I had purchased a cheaper razor because the quality of shave is no better than the Norelco shavers at less than 1/2 the price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift and he LOVES it. Can&#x27;t believe how much better it shaves and faster it is than his old Norelco shaver. I purchased this particular one because of the option of rinsing under running water to clean or using the base to &#x27;clean &amp; renew&#x27;. (I take the cartridge out between cleanings and put the cap back on it to keep it from evaporating so it lasts longer)</li>
    <li> Great shaver and performance</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading so many good reviews - and at $300 it MUST be good, right? Well not if you have a relatively soft beard and face. It just leave behind way to many hairs - and never gets close to the skin - so my face still feels like stubble, right after I finish shaving. I even bought a New head ($45) but still, just not good. I tried for 6 months - plenty of time for face to adjust. Still not a good shave. Really a disappointment. My old Panasonic razor (5 years old now) is WAY better - at least for me and my face. And it was only 1/3 of the cost.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see the point in buying the self cleaning razor. Seems like it&#x27;s just a way to sell you little containers of alcohol. The raer hurts my face as well. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this razor.&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick facial hair and shave often. This razor has held up over a number of years and continues to perform great.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning solution works well but I think is overrated. I don&#x27;t usually run it through the solution even when it says it needs it.&lt;br /&gt;Still works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been much of a fan of razors (I used Gillette Mach 3) due to the skin irritation, but used them throughout high school and college as I wasn&#x27;t required to shave daily. Once I graduated college and started a job, I knew that my skin wouldn&#x27;t be able to handle daily shaves with a razor. After reading reviews, it looked like the Braun Series 7 was the best option out there, so I went with the \\&quot;best\\&quot; model and hoped that it worked out. After 2 years of use, I can say without hesitation that this was the right choice. I shave every morning with no irritation, and the shaver is still in great shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The initial cost of the product is somewhat steep, but not having to buy razor cartridges definitely offsets that initial purchase. I&#x27;m still on my original electric shaver head, but I&#x27;m considering replacing that soon (it still feels fine, but I&#x27;m starting to wonder if I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m missing). I&#x27;m also able to stretch a clean and renew pack for about two months. I&#x27;ve found that a cleaning after 3 uses tends to be the right balance (this is generally how long it takes me to drain down the \\&quot;Hygiene\\&quot; gauge on the shaver). I also use Amazon&#x27;s \\&quot;Subscribe and Save\\&quot; program to have the refill packs automatically sent to me every 6 months at a 15% discount. So with that in mind, I believe the month to month costs are lower than traditional razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase, and I would recommend this product to anyone. I&#x27;ve had no regrets about going with the Braun Series 7.</li>
    <li> Had this for several years now.  Work great.  Good quality shave.  It all about the autocleaning.  Keeps the razor fresh, sharp and ready.  Braun has done a really great job with all design features.  Sensing cleanliness levels, power, battery, charger, travel case, etc. - excellent design.</li>
    <li> Cleaning station made to cheaply. After reading all the complaints, I find that the &amp;#34;Cleaning Station&amp;#34; will now become a nice place to place my razor, after I self-clean.  My problem is the fluid pump turns to slowly to send the fluid into the razor.  Must be clogged with hair clippings. Luckily, I can still charge the razor, which I am happy with.&lt;br /&gt;Additional problem with the &amp;#34;Cleaning Station&amp;#34; 1) contacts don&#x27;t always line up. 2) the return hole area gets plugged from the debris of shaving, 3) several times, I&#x27;ve found the solution has leaked onto the counter, during cleaning, when it was still cleaning.  Next time, I&#x27;ll just buy the Razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Very disapointed in this top of the line Electric Shaver&lt;br /&gt;from Braun. I do get a good shave, however the Quality of the unit&lt;br /&gt;is very poor. about 6 months ago the mechinism on the trimmer, would no longer&lt;br /&gt;retract, now when shaving i&#x27;ve got to hold the trimmer down, so that i can shave.&lt;br /&gt;All the chrome on the lower body is flaking off.&lt;br /&gt;A piece of the chrome on the shaving head plealed off, leaving a sharp edge,&lt;br /&gt;not realising that it was slicing my neck, in 2 places before i saw what was happening.&lt;br /&gt;I use the shaver clean &amp; renew system, but still find it hard to get the unit properly cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;It will be the last Bruan shaver that I will buy.</li>
    <li> My brother bought one of the earlier models of this and his is still working today with no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought mine close to 3 years ago and it&#x27;s still working like a champ.</li>
    <li> Fantastic shaver.  Shaves close, stays clean.  I have not been able to find an exact replacement Gillette head for it, however; the replacement head has rows of perfectly round holes rather than the complex pattern of the Gillette head.  I find that shaving with the replacement head is faster, but less close.  Put another way, after replacing the head, it becomes an excellent shaver rather than a fantastic one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it worth the money?  Consider the ongoing cost of the cleaning supplies when making the purchase decision.  Personally, after three years of daily use I still love this shaver, and I have no regrets whatsoever.  It is by a large margin the best shaver I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Purchased this Pulsonic, my first electric, way back in 2007 and not a single regret. I have a Cro Magnon Man beard when it comes to thickness and I often wonder mornings if the image in the mirror is indeed the missing link. My beard is so thick that I can&#x27;t pull a fusion razor through it. So, for the last 5 years, I&#x27;ve taken a three prong approach using a single blade then a triple and a final pass with the Pulsonic. I transform from Cro Magnon Man to baby&#x27;s butt in a handful of minutes. The pookie just loves it. She&#x27;s a nibbler and I enjoy all the attention my shave attracts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, my trimmer went south today and the blades are beginning to cause burn. My Pulsonic is looking more and more like a Brighton Beach granny in a two piece swim suit so it&#x27;s time to retire her. If your beard is thick like mine, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this electric shaver as your primary. If you take a multiple approach to your beard as I do, then, I highly recommend the Pulsonic Series 7-790cc. It&#x27;s the perfect world traveler and holds a charge for weeks on end.</li>
