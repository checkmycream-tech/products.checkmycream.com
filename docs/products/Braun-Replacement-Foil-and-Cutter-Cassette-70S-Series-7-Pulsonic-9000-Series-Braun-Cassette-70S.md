      <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
      <li>Thank you very much!</li>
      <li>Thanks!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a replacement part for a razor, how much can you say about it!!</li>
      <li>Even if it costs more, it saves easily in the long run.</li>

      <li>My Razor cuts like new now.</li>

<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> Hard to find</li>
<li> This cassette lasts at least 18 months and still cuts even then.</li>

    <li> recommend seller, great item</li>
    <li> My son orders the Foil and cutter twice a year.  He has a strong beard so this helps a lot.</li>
    <li> My Razor cuts like new now. I didn&#x27;t realize how worn mine had become.</li>
    <li> Great Product Sipping time was too long and why from Korea?</li>
    <li> Made my shaver cut like new.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. Delivery was prompt.</li>
    <li> It works fine, just wish they made the orginal style foils. They cut much better and tugged less.</li>
    <li> Thank you for the speed and care you took with this product.  Everything was great and I appreciate it greatly.</li>
    <li> Tried all the other electric shavers and they are like toys.The pulsonic helps the cut.  This cassette lasts at least 18 months and still cuts even then.Even if it costs more, it saves easily in the long run.</li>
    <li> When I received this item it did NOT include the cutter, just the foil.</li>
    <li> Product delivered IS NOT the product pictured.&lt;br /&gt;I intentionally picked THIS product, and not the others just like it for 2/3 of the cost because the cassettes with the blue cutter bar (as pictured) are higher performing, and worth the extra money.  If I had known that this was the same standard cassette as all the others on Amazon, I would have saved myself the money and bought any of the countless others.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Great product and price.</li>
    <li> The product arrived in the right amount of time and it was the correct product.  It&#x27;s a replacement part for a razor, how much can you say about it!!</li>

    <li> Work great saved me from having to buy a new shaver.</li>
    <li> When I open the case, the cassette is falling apart, simply broken. I lost a smal piece because of that. To be honest, for this kind of price, it really shouldn&#x27;t happened!!! Now I have to buy a new one again. Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> Fast service, works great</li>
    <li> Fine, but these never last as long as you want them to.  How about lasting forever.</li>
    <li> Made my Braun shave like it was new.</li>
    <li> Makes all the difference in the world. Used the last one a bit too long.</li>
    <li> I purchase one of these annually. Braun makes a good shaver</li>
