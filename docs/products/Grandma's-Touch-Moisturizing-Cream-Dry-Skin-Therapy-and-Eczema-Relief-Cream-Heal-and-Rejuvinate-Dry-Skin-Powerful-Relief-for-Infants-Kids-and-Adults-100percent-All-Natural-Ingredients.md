      <li>My eczema has gotten dramatically better!</li>

      <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
      <li>Doctors have prescribed creams that have just not been effective.</li>
      <li>A nice value for the money.  </li>
      <li>It applies very nicely and provides plenty of moisture for my skin without being super greasy.  </li>
      <li>It would be nice to maybe have these ingredients in a cream instead of lotion, maybe that would help moisturize better</li>
      <li>So far of everything I have tried coconut oil seems to work the best</li>
      <li>Grandma&#x27;s Touch has gentle but effective ingredients that feel great on my skin.  </li>
      <li>do think Grandma&#x27;s Rash Remedy would be wonderful on babies and children as it is so mild and the ingredients are so pure.</li>
      <li>So now it sits on my shelf for 26 more days, when I know that it doesn&#x27;t work for us.</li>
      <li>This lotion had many great reviews and looked promising.</li>
      <li>After trying many, many products on my severe hand eczema, I heard about Grandma&#x27;s Touch.  </li>
      <li>Stress at work aggravated it more.  </li>
      <li>I have been able to use it on my skin and also of my kids.  </li>
      <li>Pleased with the results of this.  </li>
      <li>I am sure I will buy it again.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t want to get a prescription, so I started looking online for a better remedy.  </li>
      <li>It had a strong smell and it irritates my kids skin more than it helps it.  </li>
      <li>It has mild yet effective ingredients that sooth my skin, and my eczema is gone.</li>
      <li>Used on an adult as well as an infant with great results.</li>
      <li>This lotion works really well and keeps my hands in good condition.</li>
      <li>Itchy, flakey skin has healed up very quickly.</li>
      <li>I love this great product and am recommending it to anyone who is suffering from dry skin!</li>
      <li>As well, the tube I received is HUGE.  </li>
      <li>This is a great lotion, I have allergies and get an eczema type rash, this soothed and stopped the itching for several hours.</li>
      <li>Not saying it will work for everyone because obviously I&#x27;m not a medical professional and everyone has different physiology, but this excellent product worked perfect for her and to this day whenever there is any flareup, it&#x27;s the first thing she gets.</li>
      <li>I used it consistently for many days.</li>
      <li>I think it is a truly unique product.</li>
      <li>This lotion is great for Eczema and skin that is very dry and itchy.</li>
      <li>I was using the two products together (Grandma&#x27;s Rash Remedy and the Cetaphil) but found the Cetaphil was really all that was necessary since it moisturizes so beautifully, the skin is not itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>/&gt;--Dab apple cider vinegar on the spots/blotches with a cotton ball to temporarily cool them down.&lt;br /&gt;--Spray</li>
      <li>I have exzema and this is the only product I&#x27;ve used that&#x27;s done any good.</li>
      <li>I liked that it is made from natural ingredients, and I ordered it immediately.  </li>
      <li>Although many products helped to provide temporary peace, nothing really stopped it.  </li>
      <li>(  It freshens his skin and provides some moisture (cream dries quickly), but it did not take his rash away and his episodes continue.</li>
      <li>It helps tremendously with the dryness and peeling.</li>
      <li>My son does not have skin problems when I use this (mild exema)</li>
      <li>Grandma&#x27;s Rash Remedy apparently has mild yet effective ingredients that sooth my skin, and my eczema is gone.</li>
      <li>First of all it is supposed to be fragrance free</li>
      <li>Might be worth a try.</li>
      <li>I ordered it right away.  </li>
      <li>My son kept itching his spots right after I slathered the lotion on him.</li>
      <li>Because many places were raw, most lotions and creams burned for about 5 or 10 minutes.  </li>
      <li>but this was pretty</li>
      <li>As uncomfortable as it is, I have found Aquaphor is the best moisturizer (though I go through the day feeling as if I&#x27;m covered in sticky honey).</li>
      <li>Gentle, all natural and effective for infants sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>but I got results after the first use.  </li>
      <li>Most regular lotions don&#x27;t help at all during this time period.</li>
      <li>bottle says it \\&quot;sooths sensitive skin\\&quot;, and provides relief from dry skin, eczema, mild rashes, insect bites, mild sun burns and more.  </li>
      <li>This formula is gentle enough to use on my face, and has been the only successful remedy for treating the flare ups on my eyelids.</li>
      <li>The tube appears strong enough to throw in your suitcase or purse or diaper bag (put it in a plastic freezer baggie just to be double safe.).  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not moisturizing enough to be used as a primary moisturizer on my dry, scaly skin, but it does calm the itching most days.</li>
      <li>cool showers to moisten the skin, rub creams on skin without drying off completely to seal some moisture in the skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Did not help my  dry skin problem Aveeno for eczerma worked better.</li>
      <li>For example, you may not be able to take Advil and you certainly have to be careful taking too much.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

      <li>too much sunlight for a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This stuff really works.</li>
      <li>I really thought it would work just because of all the hype</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s too much of a coincidence to be anything but the cream.</li>
      <li>I used to jokingly call it leprosy, but I was really scared.</li>

      <li>too much sunlight for a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>AND my hands stay hydrated for much longer, even after I wash my hands.</li>
      <li>I bought this lotion because I tend to have really dry hands during the winter that crack and bleed easily.</li>
      <li>Sure enough, a common diuretic I had been taking for many years was the culprit.  </li>
      <li>Those things typically are \\&quot;biologic\\&quot; and come with many side effects.</li>
      <li>This lotion has quickly repaired my hands from a reoccurring rash that flares up several times a year.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product for any type of dermatitis-related condition.</li>
      <li>/&gt;--Also try Aveeno Oatmeal Bath, or at least mix a package with warm water and dab it on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;--bandaids</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This was a cream that was recommended by Amazon to be purchased when I was browsing another product. I usually ignore those recommendations, but this time I had been wanting an eczema cream so decided to give it a try.  This stuff is wonderful.  It applies very nicely and provides plenty of moisture for my skin without being super greasy.  I have been able to use it on my skin and also of my kids.  My itchy and flaking skin is gone!</li>
    <li> For the last couple years,I had eczema around my eyes,nose and mouth. I tried several products, but they just seemed to irritate my skin rather than help it. Grandma&#x27;s Rash Remedy apparently has mild yet effective ingredients that sooth my skin, and my eczema is gone. I am so thankful to have found this great product!(review by Brian&#x27;s wife)</li>
    <li> I have severe eczema and was looking for a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; remedy to help my skin heal. This lotion had many great reviews and looked promising. I tried it out and found that it really only helps with the itching. It&#x27;s not moisturizing enough to be used as a primary moisturizer on my dry, scaly skin, but it does calm the itching most days. As uncomfortable as it is, I have found Aquaphor is the best moisturizer (though I go through the day feeling as if I&#x27;m covered in sticky honey). I&#x27;ve also begun narrowband UVB light therapy in hopes that this will be \\&quot;the cure.\\&quot; Good luck!</li>
    <li> My son suffers from episodes of bad eczema and he gets it all over his body and face. Grandma&#x27;s Rash Remedy states it offers instant relief and that people who use it will never have to suffer again and it did not meet expectation! I really thought it would work just because of all the hype and it didn&#x27;t for us:-(  It freshens his skin and provides some moisture (cream dries quickly), but it did not take his rash away and his episodes continue.</li>
    <li> I would like to say that this is a very nice product.  Its not greasy and doesn&#x27;t have a weird medicinal smell.  As well, the tube I received is HUGE.  A nice value for the money.  I didn&#x27;t realize this is for \\&quot;baby\\&quot; eczema, and I&#x27;m not SURE if I have eczema at all. However, if you have a child with a skin condition I suggest trying this stuff before running off to the doctor for a pharmaceutical product.  Those things typically are \\&quot;biologic\\&quot; and come with many side effects.</li>
    <li> As someone who WAS battling severe eczema, I found this to be a great product--one of the best of the many, many, many I had tried.  After 16 months of battle, my severe eczema is down to minor eczema, but I will tell you more about me after I tell you about this product.  The 8 oz plastic tube with snap on/off cap says it is soothing skin therapy, perfect for kids and baby eczema.  The tube appears strong enough to throw in your suitcase or purse or diaper bag (put it in a plastic freezer baggie just to be double safe.).  The tube is about 8 ½ inches long, 3 ¼ inches wide at the bottom, slightly graduating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle says it is \\&quot;100% all natural\\&quot;, a combination of organic ingredients.  The ingredient list is too long to put it all down but it looks like it is probably all natural.  Ingredients are things like organic aloe vera, shea butter, colloidal silver, nettle leaf, organic safflower oil, algin from sea kelp, jojoba oil, rosemary extract, lavender oil, vitamin E oil, etc.  (Some of this stuff I took individually to try to help my condition.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle says it \\&quot;sooths sensitive skin\\&quot;, and provides relief from dry skin, eczema, mild rashes, insect bites, mild sun burns and more.  I have sensitive skin, which was dry and split in places.  Because many places were raw, most lotions and creams burned for about 5 or 10 minutes.  This product did not burn me.  It felt soothing and cooling as it provided temporary relief by moistening my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle says it \\&quot;restores moisture\\&quot; through a combination of ingredients that target dry skin.  Yes, I believe it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle says it provides \\&quot;immediate itch relief\\&quot; with its fast acting ingredients.  I don&#x27;t think any product I tried provided immediate relief because my eczema was so severe but this was pretty fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle says \\&quot;no side effects\\&quot; because it is all organic and all natural.  This statement is probably true, at least for 99.9% of the folks.  There is always someone around to defy the odds.  Looking at the ingredients, if my little boy (now age 38) was a baby, I would not be afraid to try this product on him.  (He had a bad diaper rash as a baby.  I found out I could not use Pampers on him until he got a little older.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eczema seems to be very individual.  Some things may work well for one person, and do relatively little for another.  It can be a trip to Hades.  Some folks, like me, had it real bad.  Although many products helped to provide temporary peace, nothing really stopped it.  Mine would not heal.  It kept getting worse.  I used to jokingly call it leprosy, but I was really scared. Stress at work aggravated it more.  Some nights, I could not sleep.  Even a heavy duty cortisone shot only helped some, but would not clear it.  Finally, by the grace of God, my dermatologist realized it was probably one of my blood pressure meds.  Sure enough, a common diuretic I had been taking for many years was the culprit.  It took 16 months and 3 doctors to figure it out while I suffered.  The minute I stopped this med, I began healing.  Now I only have a very minor skin irritation.  Products like this one work well for me now.  I tell you all this to say:  Don&#x27;t overlook the possibility of a prescription med causing eczema, and Don&#x27;t expect your doctor to figure it out without you saying something.  If you have severe eczema, check the side effects of your meds.  If it sounds like one of your meds could be the culprit, get on the doctor about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a few other things that also provided temporary relief when I was desperate:  (Of course, please talk to your doctor before doing any of these tricks.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Dab apple cider vinegar on the spots/blotches with a cotton ball to temporarily cool them down.&lt;br /&gt;--Spray colloidal silver 30 ppm on the spots/blotches.&lt;br /&gt;--Take Advil (or Advil PM at night) to stop the nerves from jumping.&lt;br /&gt;--Take cool showers to moisten the skin, rub creams on skin without drying off completely to seal some moisture in the skin.&lt;br /&gt;--Rub emu oil into the skin to moisten it.&lt;br /&gt;--Rub coconut oil into the skin to moisten it.&lt;br /&gt;--Dot Milk of Magnesia on the spots with a cotton ball (works for some folks--only helped a tiny bit for me.  Burns at first.)&lt;br /&gt;--Also try Aveeno Oatmeal Bath, or at least mix a package with warm water and dab it on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;--bandaids may help on a few oozy/sore spots&lt;br /&gt;--CHECK PRESCRIPTION MEDS FOR POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS.&lt;br /&gt;(Of course,check with your doctor.  For example, you may not be able to take Advil and you certainly have to be careful taking too much.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found that my eczema was aggravated by:&lt;br /&gt;--Stress&lt;br /&gt;--handling paper, including computer paper with colored ink&lt;br /&gt;--house heat (baseboard heating in winter)&lt;br /&gt;--and too much sunlight for a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to you if you are suffering from eczema.  Believe me, I know what you are going through.  DON&#x27;T GIVE UP!!!.ms on skin without drying off completely to seal some moisture in the skin.&lt;br /&gt;--Rub emu oil into the skin to moisten it.&lt;br /&gt;--Rub coconut oil into the skin to moisten it.&lt;br /&gt;--Dot Milk of Magnesia on the spots with a cotton ball (works for some folks--only helped a tiny bit for me.  Burns at first.)&lt;br /&gt;--Also try Aveeno Oatmeal Bath, or at least mix a package with warm water and dab it on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;--bandaids may help on a few oozy/sore spots&lt;br /&gt;--CHECK PRESCRIPTION MEDS FOR POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS.&lt;br /&gt;(Of course,check with your doctor.  For example, you may not be able to take Advil and you certainly have to be careful taking too much.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found that my eczema was aggravated by:&lt;br /&gt;--Stress&lt;br /&gt;--handling paper, including computer paper with colored ink&lt;br /&gt;--house heat (baseboard heating in winter)&lt;br /&gt;--and too much sunlight for a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to you if you are suffering from eczema.  Believe me, I know what you are going through.  DON&#x27;T GIVE UP!!!.</li>
    <li> Grandma&#x27;s Rash Remedy is the only product that soothes my dermatitis, and helps to reduce the frequency of my flare ups. This formula is gentle enough to use on my face, and has been the only successful remedy for treating the flare ups on my eyelids. I highly recommend this product for any type of dermatitis-related condition.</li>
    <li> I had a patch of cracked, itchy skin that developed on my earlobe. I tried for months to use soap, Neosporin, etc. on it. It was really terrible looking and was not healing. I never realized what it was until I did a google search on it and realized it was eczema. I searched for natural products and found this one but I ended up buying it on Amazon just because I have an account here. I have been using this cream for about 2 weeks and it&#x27;s 95% gone! I noticed a big difference within the first few days. It&#x27;s too much of a coincidence to be anything but the cream. I can&#x27;t wait until it&#x27;s completely healed, I&#x27;ve never had anything like that before!</li>
    <li> My tube had also opened on the seamed end. I had to tape it shut to squeeze the tube.  So far no improvement in the rash.</li>
    <li> I have a pretty bad case of Excema and I am also dermatagraphic. I have tried every online home remedy and been thought three dermatologists and one allergist. Unfortunately nothing seems to work for me and Grandmas Rash Cream was no better. So far of everything I have tried coconut oil seems to work the best but I would give it a five on a scale to ten.</li>
    <li> Finally found a product that I can use daily to help with the itching of chronic excema. This stuff is wonderful!</li>
    <li> Pleased with the results of this.  I have pretty dry skin so am happy that I was recommend this product. A+</li>
    <li> Did not help my  dry skin problem Aveeno for eczerma worked better.</li>
    <li> Did not do completely what i expected,did stop the itch,but takes a whilel. Did not cure the rash as expected</li>
    <li> I thought it was a good moisturizer but didn&#x27;t help my eczema. Still looking for something to help!</li>
    <li> I had eczema on my eyelid for over five months and was using Hydrocortisone 1% and Suuthe&#x27;s Skin Repair salve with temporary results only.  It would keep coming back, even if applied one or both of them every night, multiple times each night.  I don&#x27;t want to get a prescription, so I started looking online for a better remedy.  I wish I&#x27;d looked around sooner!  This stuff is amazing.  After only three applications, there is almost no sign of the rash I had.  There is no more itching, burning or redness on my eyelid at all!</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion, I have allergies and get an eczema type rash, this soothed and stopped the itching for several hours.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for treatment of my eczema; which the bottle said it works well for. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference so I gave the remainder of the cream to my daughter-in-law for my granddaughter. NOT worth the price!</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my 16 year old son&#x27;s exzema.  Didn&#x27;t work at all made him rash worse and made him itch even more.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully.  My son does not have skin problems when I use this (mild exema)</li>
    <li> I purchased for my son that has eczema...works well for him!</li>
    <li> I love it! My eczema has gotten dramatically better! Plus it doesn&#x27;t have a nasty smell AND my hands stay hydrated for much longer, even after I wash my hands.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my babies skin. Gentle, all natural and effective for infants sensitive skin.  I think it is a truly unique product.</li>
    <li> After trying many, many products on my severe hand eczema, I heard about Grandma&#x27;s Touch.  I liked that it is made from natural ingredients, and I ordered it immediately.  The first time I used it on my red, chapped, broken skinned hands I could feel the difference.  The insanity inducing itching eased and then stopped, and by the second day the open sores were healing.  I am ordering another jar for back up.</li>
    <li> My daughter had Eczema and the doctor of course prescribed ROID CREAM which there&#x27;s no way in hell we were giving her due to Red Skin Syndrome etc.  Please don&#x27;t always listen to your doctor.  This was one of the things we tried and the last thing we tried.  Not saying it will work for everyone because obviously I&#x27;m not a medical professional and everyone has different physiology, but this excellent product worked perfect for her and to this day whenever there is any flareup, it&#x27;s the first thing she gets.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cream for my 3 month old who has patches of eczema all over; I didn&#x27;t want to have to use a steroid based cream on him.  After just a single use I saw a difference in his skin.  I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after a few days of using it!  Would highly recommend so far!</li>
    <li> very good cream for daughter&#x27;s eczema, she loves it</li>
    <li> I purchased Grandma&#x27;s Rash Remedy for an extremely dry/itchy/red patch of skin. I used it consistently for many days. It did help with the itch but did NOTHING at all for the dryness which is what CAUSED the itchiness. It did cut down on the redness, as well. However, I would not recommend this for anyone with an eczema type condition as the product does not moisturize well.  My daughter used it for some spots on her arm (not sure what they were) and it did help with the itch and softened her skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Cetaphil Restoraderm and THAT is amazing. It helps tremendously with the dryness and peeling. I was using the two products together (Grandma&#x27;s Rash Remedy and the Cetaphil) but found the Cetaphil was really all that was necessary since it moisturizes so beautifully, the skin is not itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think Grandma&#x27;s Rash Remedy would be wonderful on babies and children as it is so mild and the ingredients are so pure. However, it did not work for me as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in this product.  First of all it is supposed to be fragrance free but it isn&#x27;t.  It had a strong smell and it irritates my kids skin more than it helps it.  Wish I didn&#x27;t spend the money.</li>
    <li> Smells good, not greasy. Prevents cracking very well almost days later. But is a little on the high side in price!!</li>
    <li> I know there is no miracle cream for curing my lil boy&#x27;s eczema. Bought this cream because it was supposed to be all natural. But it did not heal or worsen his eczema. It can be used as a lotion but it is not very effective for long lasting hydration or does not soothe irritation on application. My son kept itching his spots right after I slathered the lotion on him. I&#x27;ve used it for a week with no improvements so now only use it sporadically.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to try on my baby girl&#x27;s eczema because I have tried everything else and because this company promises a 100% refund if you are not satisfied. Well, it made my girl&#x27;s skin much worse within one day of use. When I called customer service to try and return it, they said that customers are required to have the product for at least 30 days before they can even ask to return it. So now it sits on my shelf for 26 more days, when I know that it doesn&#x27;t work for us. Very frustrating.</li>
    <li> This lotion has quickly repaired my hands from a reoccurring rash that flares up several times a year. It feels really good on the skin without leaving a greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> This lotion did help a little for the skin itching but did very little to moisturize my sons very dry skin. It would be nice to maybe have these ingredients in a cream instead of lotion, maybe that would help moisturize better</li>
    <li> This lotion is great for Eczema and skin that is very dry and itchy. Used on an adult as well as an infant with great results. I would definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works.I have exzema and this is the only product I&#x27;ve used that&#x27;s done any good. GOOD LUCK!</li>
    <li> One of the reviews talked about the same problem I was experiencing.  (Itchy earlobe).  I had tried every lotion on the shelf, nothing helped.  I found this product by accident through a search.  I ordered it right away.  It may not work for everyone but I got results after the first use.  Might be worth a try.</li>
    <li> Works great for my daughter! Bout to buy some more!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this rash remedy in hopes of healing my Dad&#x27;s hand. Doctors have prescribed creams that have just not been effective. I stumbled onto a website that listed Grandma&#x27;s Rash Remedy and decided...why not try it. It has worked wonders!!! Dad said, \\&quot;My hand finally looks normal again.\\&quot; Even his doctors have taken down the name of this remedy. They too were very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> My 2 year old has bad eczema and this product has helped when nothing else did!  I&#x27;ve tried everything on the market and so far only this and Exzaderm have worked.  I recommend this to anyone with eczema issues.</li>
    <li> I just get the cream I hope It work I will go to write another review after a couples weeks .</li>
    <li> OK and worked great but no enough and cost to much!</li>
    <li> I live in a colder climate and it takes its toll on my skin. This moisturizing cream does wonders for me. Itchy, flakey skin has healed up very quickly. The cream feels really good and is not overly greasy. It has mild yet effective ingredients that sooth my skin, and my eczema is gone.</li>
    <li> For a couple of years now, I have had pretty dry skin on my hands and face. I tried several different products, but they didn&#x27;t solve the problem and just seemed to irritate my skin. Grandma&#x27;s Touch has gentle but effective ingredients that feel great on my skin.  My eczema is basically gone and my skin is so much smoother than before. I love this great product and am recommending it to anyone who is suffering from dry skin!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the way it felt when applying to skin. It&#x27;s watery but I used it anyway but didn&#x27;t get any results for skin rash. I used it for a week and stop using it because it didn&#x27;t help. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion because I tend to have really dry hands during the winter that crack and bleed easily. Most regular lotions don&#x27;t help at all during this time period. This lotion works really well and keeps my hands in good condition. I am sure I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This lotion is wonderful. I have used it for sunburn even and the next day you can&#x27;t even tell that you were sunburnt.</li>
