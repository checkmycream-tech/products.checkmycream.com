      <li>I love that it also comes in Value Pack of 60.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Most wipes come in a package of 25.</li>
      <li>I first discovered these amazing wipes in Cambridge, England when I attended a University summer program there many years ago.  </li>
      <li>These come in a package of 30 which makes it more economical.</li>
      <li>If you have Amazon Prime, you can get them here for a reasonable price (shipping benefits); otherwise, you can buy them at Target, if you have one handy.  </li>
      <li>They are also a great start to your daily moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Great for removing my waterproof mascara (I wear waterproof daily).  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll find them gentle on even the most sensitive skin, excellent for removing makeup, great for wiping little faces smeared with food, and exceptionally refreshing during &amp;#34;those times of the month&amp;#34; when you just want to feel fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>The first time I used them, I fell in love with them.  </li>
      <li>The scent is very mild &amp; fresh smelling.</li>
      <li>And it leaves your face feeling clean and moist.</li>
      <li>Face didn&#x27;t feel clean after use</li>
      <li>I was right!  </li>
      <li>They remove waterproof mascara easily and gently.  </li>
      <li>These wipes work fast and easy and even remove eye makeup without rubbing and tugging.</li>
      <li>Besides the plastic taped cover...there is also a cover that snaps which keep the wipes fresh &amp; from drying out.</li>
      <li>But like, that&#x27;s what these cloths are supposed to do, right?</li>
      <li>Sometimes hard to find but all work great.</li>
      <li>That summer was hideously (albeit unusually) hot for England.  </li>
      <li>Everything put out by this company is great - non irritating, gentle and it works</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used facial wipes before and they either broke out my face or didn&#x27;t really clean my face.</li>
      <li>but I these again and highly recommend them.</li>
      <li>These can sometimes be found for a couple dollars cheaper at the store, but I figured it was worth the extra cost to not have to trek out to the store.</li>
      <li>I use one very night and know that my face is clean and soft and not stripped and dry.</li>
      <li>For the high reviews these had, I thought they&#x27;d clear my face a little more, but they did not.</li>
      <li>These wipes are necessary self-indulgences for the modern woman (and man)!</li>
      <li>This is the first facial wipe cleanser that truly removes all makeup, mascara, etc.  </li>
      <li>Wow -- what a difference!  </li>
      <li>and they stay moist all the way to the last ones in the package, unlike most other brands that are pretty dry by the end.</li>
      <li>and they are gentle enough for all skin types.</li>
      <li>I tried another brand recently, but immediately regretted it, as it the wipes were much thinner and flimsy compared to my Boots No7</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and these work well on me.  </li>
      <li>only complaint is these are mostly sold on-line.</li>
      <li>These wipes are gentle enough to be used daily.</li>
      <li>I only wear eye makeup and some concealer normally, so I tend to reuse the wipes, they stay useable until I can&#x27;t use the same wipe.</li>

    <li> These are a little dry for me.</li>
    <li> Love them! Remove makeup without drying out your skin.</li>
    <li> Great product, have been using these wipe for years.</li>
    <li> These cloths are great for removing makeup, even waterproof mascara.  They are also a great start to your daily moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Face didn&#x27;t feel clean after use</li>
    <li> THEY CAME IN A WHITE PACK AND WERE NOT THE SAME AS BLUE PACK VERY DRY. SEEMS AS THOUGH NOT SAME PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used facial wipes before and they either broke out my face or didn&#x27;t really clean my face. These wipes take off every bit of makeup and leave my face feeling as if I had used my regular cleanser! I&#x27;ll be but I these again and highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> You know, these worked. They cleaned the makeup off my face. But like, that&#x27;s what these cloths are supposed to do, right? For the high reviews these had, I thought they&#x27;d clear my face a little more, but they did not. I still had to use them, followed by actually washing my face with acne cleanser (Coral Actives). Still, they cleared the make up, so I&#x27;ll take that!</li>
    <li> Everything put out by this company is great - non irritating, gentle and it works</li>
    <li> These are so great on my skin, I buy these in big packs, so I&#x27;m very glad Amazon has them! I have sensitive skin and these work well on me.  Great for removing my waterproof mascara (I wear waterproof daily).  I only wear eye makeup and some concealer normally, so I tend to reuse the wipes, they stay useable until I can&#x27;t use the same wipe.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great product</li>
    <li> These wipes work fast and easy and even remove eye makeup without rubbing and tugging. They don&#x27;t make my eyes burn like some removers do. I use one very night and know that my face is clean and soft and not stripped and dry. They are really the best I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different brands of makeup remover wipes. These are the BEST!! They are packaged well. Besides the plastic taped cover...there is also a cover that snaps which keep the wipes fresh &amp; from drying out. I also like the thickness of each wipe. They remove like Kleenex tissues &amp; don&#x27;t get caught or bunched up. The scent is very mild &amp; fresh smelling. Most wipes come in a package of 25. These come in a package of 30 which makes it more economical. I love that it also comes in Value Pack of 60.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is these are mostly sold on-line. Seems like only Target sells them @ their stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Review by Tom Chu&#x27;s wife.</li>
    <li> These are great!! They remove waterproof mascara easily and gently.  My skin looks great, no drying AT ALL. They&#x27;re going to be my go to cleanser</li>
    <li> Love everything Boots No 7, but I really love these face wipes. They are &amp;#34;just right&amp;#34; abrasive, and I get blackheads in the t-zone, so these work wonders for my skin.</li>
    <li> I first discovered these amazing wipes in Cambridge, England when I attended a University summer program there many years ago.  The first time I used them, I fell in love with them.  That summer was hideously (albeit unusually) hot for England.  I was in a college dorm (house) in a single room without toilet, bath, or shower.  There was, however a sink.  I recall literally layering my body with wipes when the heat became intolerable, letting them dry out, rewetting them, and reapplying them!  When that summer ended, I left England with several packages, sure I&#x27;d never find a Boots store and their brand of wipes, here at home.  I was right!  At that time, I couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere in Pittsburgh.  So imagine my surprise a couple of years ago when I discovered them at a Target store!  A bit later, I found them here at Amazon.  If you have Amazon Prime, you can get them here for a reasonable price (shipping benefits); otherwise, you can buy them at Target, if you have one handy.  You&#x27;ll find them gentle on even the most sensitive skin, excellent for removing makeup, great for wiping little faces smeared with food, and exceptionally refreshing during &amp;#34;those times of the month&amp;#34; when you just want to feel fresh and clean. In the colder months or when I just want to indulge myself, I&#x27;ll put one in the microwave for 10 or 12 short seconds before use--heaven!  These wipes are necessary self-indulgences for the modern woman (and man)!</li>
    <li> I love all of their products. Sometimes hard to find but all work great. they keep skin smoothe and healthy</li>
    <li> This is the first facial wipe cleanser that truly removes all makeup, mascara, etc.  And it leaves your face feeling clean and moist.</li>
    <li> Favorite go to makeup wipes on the market. Good value and they stay moist all the way to the last ones in the package, unlike most other brands that are pretty dry by the end.</li>
    <li> A lady working the checkout at Target recommended I try these while I was checking out with Neutrogena wipes.  So, next time I did. Wow -- what a difference!  These No 7 wipes work the same (if not better) with about 1/2 the oily, greasy feeling I used to get from other makeup wipes. I love them.</li>
    <li> This the best product ever for removing make-up and leaving your skin so soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I have typically purchased this brand of makeup removing wipes at Target.  I&#x27;ve tried several brands that they carry there and had the best results with these wipes.  The laziness factor is great--not too much work before bed, removes my makeup and doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts, which has been a problem for me in the past.  I tried another brand recently, but immediately regretted it, as it the wipes were much thinner and flimsy compared to my Boots No7, I needed to use more to remove my makeup, and the smell was not as pleasant.  I found myself not wanting to use them. I immediately switched back!  These can sometimes be found for a couple dollars cheaper at the store, but I figured it was worth the extra cost to not have to trek out to the store.</li>
    <li> These wipes are gentle enough to be used daily. They have just enough moisture so that they don&#x27;t drag across your face and they are gentle enough for all skin types. Perfect for travel.</li>
