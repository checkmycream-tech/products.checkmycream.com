      <li>But now, just a week into my Fusion ProGlide trial, I&#x27;m happy to report I&#x27;ve been smoke free for 6 days and counting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But this Proglide can was amazing.</li>
      <li>I got the product free from Gillette but have to say its a great product.  </li>

      <li>I am loving this and will recommend it a million times</li>
      <li>I would recommend getting both the razor and gel as they work great together to give you a clean, close shave and leave your skin softer than it was when you started.</li>
      <li>I felt the tingle from the gel which was very fresh and pleasant not too strong.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Gel with skin care is the best new product to come along in my lifetime for a smooth shave.  </li>
      <li>This shave gel is top notch</li>
      <li>Regarding the flex ball technology, the part that sets this razor apart from the rest, it is perfectly able to run over the contours of my face.</li>
      <li>The shave is the part that I&#x27;m most concerned with, and there, I have no complaints.</li>
      <li>I went into work the next day to my boss and told him (with my perfect shaven awesomeness) that I would take my raise now.  </li>
      <li>decided to try this out since I have seen so many commercials out there</li>
      <li>And, the better it follows your face</li>
      <li>all that stated I think the vibrating Gillette razor worked better at preventing redness and irritation than this razor.  </li>
      <li>The dispenser will not rust so you don’t have to worry about scrubbing those rust rings off your vanity top.  </li>
      <li>wait -- there&#x27;s more.</li>
      <li>I got a nice clean shave.  </li>
      <li>More than just giving a smooth and satisfying shave it ends the need for after shave.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more favorable than those cheap cartridge razors.</li>
      <li>makes this one of the most comfortable shaves I can obtain.  </li>
      <li>the best of both worlds, Applying the shaving gel is like magic it spreads and will not dry unlike most other brand and that cool minty feeling is great for the face.</li>
      <li>I really like the twist top can much better than a can with a top that pops off.  </li>
      <li>The gel it self was even better its foams up and feels cool on your skin.</li>
      <li>It seems logical that the more ways the head can pivot that the better the razor will conform to the contours of your face.  </li>
      <li>Smooth easy shave.</li>
      <li>The overall design is splendid.</li>
      <li>I had been a loyal Mach-3 razor guy for many years.  </li>
      <li>When the opportunity presented itself to get one of these razors for free to try through BzzAgent, I jumped on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The Flexball gives a smooth shave.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There was no irritation afterwards and my electric razor does not leave my skin this smooth</li>
      <li>I felt so smooth shaven that my confidence level boosted to 1000%.  </li>
      <li>Great for following the contours of your face</li>
      <li>I received this razor (and a full-sized sample of the gel) for free as part of a promotion from Gillette.</li>
      <li>The Proglide gel helps give me a comfortable shave.</li>
      <li>I got this shave gel as a free promo from Gillette.  </li>
      <li>I received a combo pack free from Gillette for testing and review.  </li>
      <li>Maybe I&#x27;m using too much at a time!  :-)  </li>
      <li>, I did not notice any significant difference in the quality of my shave in comparison to my existing Gillette ProGlide razor.  </li>
      <li>Definately worth the upgrade!</li>
      <li>When I tried the FlexBall the first time, it was even better than the already-great results I got with the ProGlide Power razors.  </li>
      <li>It goes on smooth, has just the right amount of lather, and rinses off easily.</li>
      <li>Whith that being said I do have to say that this new shaving gel has been amazing.</li>
      <li>but I can see the appeal, and the shave itself was smooth, close, and surprisingly quick.  </li>
      <li>Whether you want to clean shave or a neatly trimmed beard this razor will do the job</li>
      <li>I like the cool tingling feeling.</li>
      <li>, how many blades do you really have to have on a cartridge?</li>
      <li>It gives you thrills and chills just looking at how clean you face becomes .It is almost like looking at a new person i am def satisfied.</li>
      <li>After I left his office to find another job as he fired me I realized it was not because of me asking for money, he was obviously jealous of how awesome my shave was and couldn&#x27;t take it</li>
      <li>nice smooth clean shave, a tiny amount of ProGlide goes a long way, feels good and works very well with the Flex Ball Razor.</li>
      <li>No rust is a good thing, however, I go through shaving creme fast enough that it&#x27;s never been a problem before.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product, especially those with sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I am a BzzAgent and received a free Gillette Fusion Proglide razor and Shaving Gel for Sensitive Skin for free to review.  </li>
      <li>A little TOO quick, for my tastes - I enjoy the ritual - but if you&#x27;re shaving for speed and efficiency, you couldn&#x27;t do much better than this cartridge razor.  </li>
      <li>I find it&#x27;s an even better shave with this gel than what I normally used (Schick, then Old Spice gel).&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like a combined   Aloe lotion and shave gel which leaves your skin soft and smooth without any pain.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for this opportunity, BzzAgent!</li>
      <li>The gauge that shows how much you have left is an interesting concept.  </li>
      <li>see, as a man with a formidable facial stubble situation, half of the joy of lighting up a cancer stick was the rush of masculinity I felt when striking a match against my coarse sandpaper jaw line.  </li>
      <li>Once you apply the razor its like coming down a great big sliding board.</li>
      <li>This review is only for the gel, I previously reviewed the razor (5 stars - great product).  </li>
      <li>It works well with the razor, but in my experience most sensitive skin shave gels work pretty much the same.  </li>
      <li>I passed the blade 2 times on each side and left my face very smooth (granted I am not a big facial hair grower so others may have to pass more than twice.)&lt;br /&gt;After rinsing</li>
      <li>Decided to upgrade to the Fusion Proglide (manual) and really like it.  </li>
      <li>My husband says he gets such a close and smooth shave with this razor.</li>
      <li>There I go, using too much again.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for changing my life Gillette.  </li>
      <li>This product did provide me with a comfortable shave and removed my facial hair effortlessly.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t notice much change in the shave between this razor and my Mach3 razor.</li>
      <li>So, if the no-mess feature is important to you, I would recommend the gel because that feature definitely works as intended.</li>
      <li>It really does keep this can cleaner.  </li>
      <li>proof bottle which shows how much is left inside is pretty cool also.</li>
      <li>The shaving gel has a clean mild scent and left my face feeling really soft.</li>
      <li>I remember when the advertisements for a dual blade razor used to illustrate how the first blade would pull the whisker and the 2nd blade would cut it super close.</li>
      <li>no mess gel dispenser is a simple and practical enhancement that works great in preventing the post-use goo that I encounter with other shaving gels.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d regularly used the Fusion ProGlide Power razors, so I was already familiar with Gillette.  </li>
      <li>face has never felt so smooth, and even late into the night matches don&#x27;t stand a chance at striking a flame against this soft as a baby&#x27;s ass of a face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the Gillette Fusion ProGlide FlexBall razor in the past, and I liked it.  </li>
      <li>The best part was that I shaved in the morning before work and expected the usual five o’clock shadow later, but I didn’t need to shave again for almost two days.  </li>

    <li> My best shave ever. I can&#x27;t wait to shave it&#x27;s that pleasurable.</li>
    <li> Smooth easy shave. Good deal</li>
    <li> My chin-hairs weep&lt;br /&gt;flowing down the drain&lt;br /&gt;The chin itself,&lt;br /&gt;smooth and uncut.</li>
    <li> Great for following the contours of your face</li>
    <li> As a long time smoker, I&#x27;ve tried just about everything under the sun to drop my habit -- nicotine gum, patches, lozenges, self-enforced taser shocking in hopes of producing some sort of negative pavlovian response, but nothing&#x27;s really stuck...Until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see, as a man with a formidable facial stubble situation, half of the joy of lighting up a cancer stick was the rush of masculinity I felt when striking a match against my coarse sandpaper jaw line.  But now, just a week into my Fusion ProGlide trial, I&#x27;m happy to report I&#x27;ve been smoke free for 6 days and counting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face has never felt so smooth, and even late into the night matches don&#x27;t stand a chance at striking a flame against this soft as a baby&#x27;s ass of a face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But wait -- there&#x27;s more. Since I stopped smoking, I&#x27;ve gotten a raise, finally went back to college and finished my degree and tracked down my long lost birth mother the day before she won the Florida state lotto and gifted me half of her winnings.  Thanks for changing my life Gillette.  Yours forever and always ~BB</li>
    <li> Got the set from BzzAgent. I don&#x27;t notice much change in the shave between this razor and my Mach3 razor. It does give a great shave, dont get me wrong. Whith that being said I do have to say that this new shaving gel has been amazing. I could use this gel and shave with a dull kitchen knife and still not have razor burn.</li>
    <li> I received a combo pack free from Gillette for testing and review.  Let&#x27;s start with the gel.  I really like the twist top can much better than a can with a top that pops off.  The gauge that shows how much you have left is an interesting concept.  I usually have a pretty good idea of how much is left by the weight of the can, so, to me, this is not a big advantage.  No rust is a good thing, however, I go through shaving creme fast enough that it&#x27;s never been a problem before.  Maybe I&#x27;m using too much at a time!  :-)  I generally shave 6 days a week.  I don&#x27;t like a heavy scent in my shaving products.  The Active Sport Gel has a smell that I like, and it&#x27;s not overbearing.  I would like it if the gel came out of the can just a little faster.  There I go, using too much again.  I like the cool tingling feeling. I got a nice clean shave.  The sensitive skin formula does seem to have a &amp;#34;calming&amp;#34; effect on my skin.  Now, on to the ProGlide Razor.  It seems logical that the more ways the head can pivot that the better the razor will conform to the contours of your face.  And, the better it follows your face the closer shave you will get.  And, you should get fewer nicks and cuts.  I found the razor to provide a clean close shave with few nicks and cuts.  The handle of the shaver was ok, but not great in my opinion.  It&#x27;s kind of bulky where I&#x27;d like it to be thinner.  It&#x27;s a minor thing, but it just doesn&#x27;t feel like it fits my hand like I want it to.  The shave is the part that I&#x27;m most concerned with, and there, I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Good stuff as always by the Fusion line...that spill proof bottle which shows how much is left inside is pretty cool also.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 Shave Gel + Skin Care from Gillette to try and to comment on my experience using this product.  I have used Gillette products and had high expectations for this trial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The no mess gel dispenser is a simple and practical enhancement that works great in preventing the post-use goo that I encounter with other shaving gels.  The dispenser will not rust so you don’t have to worry about scrubbing those rust rings off your vanity top.  With the new gel gauge on the side on the dispenser, I don’t have to skip shaving when I run out.  The gel also leaves my face moisturized so I don’t have to worry about apply lotion to prevent razor burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In regards to the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor with FlexBall Technology, I did not notice any significant difference in the quality of my shave in comparison to my existing Gillette ProGlide razor.  This product did provide me with a comfortable shave and removed my facial hair effortlessly.  In my particular case, I would not spend the extra three to four dollars for the flexball technology.  I am happy with my existing Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor.</li>
    <li> My blade won&#x27;t stay on. It keeps popping off when I use it. I finally gave up on it and went back to my old razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, how many blades do you really have to have on a cartridge? I remember when the advertisements for a dual blade razor used to illustrate how the first blade would pull the whisker and the 2nd blade would cut it super close. Then they came up with 3 blades, 4 blades....now 5 blades??? When will it all end? 32 blades contained within a 3&amp;#34; cartridge? It&#x27;s all a bunch of BS gimmicks in order to obtain future sales and keep the corporation alive.</li>
    <li> the Flexball moved over with ease, it didn&#x27;t cut u like other razor</li>
    <li> I received this razor-and-gel package as a promotional package from the manufacturer, and I have to say that for a cartridge razor, this is about the best I&#x27;ve used.  I typically shave with a straight-razor (cutthroat)and have for years, so it&#x27;s pretty hard to impress me with multi-blades and fancy handles.  This one impressed me.  The shave gel is a lot different from what I&#x27;m used to (a mug and a brush) but I can see the appeal, and the shave itself was smooth, close, and surprisingly quick.  A little TOO quick, for my tastes - I enjoy the ritual - but if you&#x27;re shaving for speed and efficiency, you couldn&#x27;t do much better than this cartridge razor.  Recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Mach 3 for the past 5+ years and recently switched to this. Razors are expensive but aren&#x27;t they all?  Definately worth the upgrade!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, especially those with sensitive skin.  I used this and had a great shave, smooth and and close..  I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> This review is only for the gel, I previously reviewed the razor (5 stars - great product).  I got this shave gel as a free promo from Gillette.  It gives a good shave and I really like the swivel head that prevents all of that excess crap that usually comes out of a normal shave can after you use it.  It really does keep this can cleaner.  The smell is a little much for me, I think I would prefer one of the other scents.  The gel does leave your face a bit &amp;#34;tingly&amp;#34; -- which I like, but some may not.  It works well with the razor, but in my experience most sensitive skin shave gels work pretty much the same.  So, if the no-mess feature is important to you, I would recommend the gel because that feature definitely works as intended.</li>
    <li> When I received my razor and shaver from BzzAgent, I was skeptical. Although my experience, provided by the test team, proved that my initial skepticism was wrong. The Fusion proglide razor&#x27;s design is handsome! The handle of weight is well balanced; its heavy enough that you you feel no need to put extra weight when shaving and is light enough that it isn&#x27;t s burden to use. The overall design is splendid. Regarding the flex ball technology, the part that sets this razor apart from the rest, it is perfectly able to run over the contours of my face. It&#x27;s more favorable than those cheap cartridge razors.</li>
    <li> THIS RAZOR CHANGED MY LIFE!!!!  I was tired of shaving with triangles, squares, and tetrahedrons as they just don&#x27;t leave as good a shave as a spherical shapes I could not think of.  Then one day I came across a promotion from #Gillette through #bzzagents and BAM!  Gillette introduces FLEXBALL technology!  A ball! Of course how could I not realize this is the epitome of a spherical shape!  Now I instantly signed up for this and when I received it... Changed... My... Life...  I felt so smooth shaven that my confidence level boosted to 1000%.  I went into work the next day to my boss and told him (with my perfect shaven awesomeness) that I would take my raise now.  After I left his office to find another job as he fired me I realized it was not because of me asking for money, he was obviously jealous of how awesome my shave was and couldn&#x27;t take it I looked better than him!  So as security was escorting me out I slipped away fast enough before being tazered to drop off some Flexball coupons to him.  I haven&#x27;t gotten a thank you but I believe he got them, at least that&#x27;s what the doctors are telling me as I woke up in ER, something about an accident after being tazed hitting a fish tank spinning around on a hammock and landing on a fist...twice... #changedmylife #recommend #awesomesauce</li>
    <li> I received the promotional Gillette package which contained a Fusion Pro Glide Razor and the fusion pro-glide sensitive shaving gel.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t usually shave with razors because they irritate my skin, I tend to gravitate towards electric razors.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this out since I have seen so many commercials out there and I am pleasantly surprised with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I wet my face then applied the shaving gel which foams up immediately to the touch and has a good thick consistency. I proceeded to shave and the razor is indeed very sensitive to the facial curvatures and moves accordingly. I passed the blade 2 times on each side and left my face very smooth (granted I am not a big facial hair grower so others may have to pass more than twice.)&lt;br /&gt;After rinsing I felt the tingle from the gel which was very fresh and pleasant not too strong.&lt;br /&gt;There was no irritation afterwards and my electric razor does not leave my skin this smooth so I may continue using the Fusion ProGlide Razor.</li>
    <li> When we received this package from Bzzagents we were a little skeptical since most african americans rarely use razors.And when we do it is usually at a barbershop and they use a straight razor but we decided to give it a go and all i can say is Thank You Gillette .Definately the best of both worlds, Applying the shaving gel is like magic it spreads and will not dry unlike most other brand and that cool minty feeling is great for the face.Once you apply the razor its like coming down a great big sliding board.It gives you thrills and chills just looking at how clean you face becomes .It is almost like looking at a new person i am def satisfied.Great job Gillette Fusion Pro Glide and also thank bzzagents for introducing me to this wonderful product.I am loving this and will recommend it a million times</li>
    <li> dont see a difference between this one and the proshaver they have</li>
    <li> Received this as a Bizz Agent trial.&lt;br /&gt; These work great together. nice smooth clean shave, a tiny amount of ProGlide goes a long way, feels good and works very well with the Flex Ball Razor.</li>
    <li> When you pick up the GIllette fusion shaving gel  you can see it&#x27;ll be different. I got the product free from Gillette but have to say its a great product.  I had been been using Gillette brand for years and its usually the Mach 3 shaving gel. But this Proglide can was amazing. there is twist off cap which seals the can after you have gel out.  A normal shave can squeezes out gel for a few minutes after you have taken out the normal amount of gel to be used but with this twist off nothing more comes out since you can twist the cap and block it. The gel it self was even better its foams up and feels cool on your skin. More than just giving a smooth and satisfying shave it ends the need for after shave. The smells stays you and its soothing effect too. It&#x27;s like a combined   Aloe lotion and shave gel which leaves your skin soft and smooth without any pain.  This shave gel is top notch The razor is just as great. Unlike regular razors which only move up and down only by swiveling left and right as you shave it adds another dimension to your shave. Whether you want to clean shave or a neatly trimmed beard this razor will do the job</li>
    <li> I bought this razor because I experience terrible razor burn.  I was using a DE (double edge) razor and no matter the blade I tried I could not get rid of razor burn.  The trick, with shaving in general, is to hold the handle at the very tip and use no downward pressure - let the weight of the head do all the work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all that stated I think the vibrating Gillette razor worked better at preventing redness and irritation than this razor.  For those consumers who don&#x27;t have to deal with such problems I would say this is  a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At purchase I got the razor and a can of shaving gel for nearly cheaper than 1 razor head replacement would cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to all you men and women!</li>
    <li> I ordered the Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor With Flexball Handle Technology With 1 Razor Blade + Proglide Sensitive Shaving Gel 7 Oz. My husband says he gets such a close and smooth shave with this razor. He also likes the shaving gel. The flexball razor makes it easier for him to shave without irritation and cuts. This blade seems to last longer than other razors too. He&#x27;s quite happy with it.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this one.</li>
    <li> I am a BzzAgent and received a free Gillette Fusion Proglide razor and Shaving Gel for Sensitive Skin for free to review.  I am using my wife’s Amazon account to leave my review.  The razor is one of the best that I have ever used.  I had about two weeks of hair growth (actually a beard) and decided to shave it off.  I applied the shaving gel as directed then set to work with the razor.  I was actually amazed; it took off all the hair in one sweep.  I did not have to go back over any areas, and boy it is a nice close shave.  The pivoting ball let the razor follow the contours of my face and I did not have any nicks, bumps, or redness when I was done.  The shaving gel has a clean mild scent and left my face feeling really soft. The best part was that I shaved in the morning before work and expected the usual five o’clock shadow later, but I didn’t need to shave again for almost two days.  I can’t say it will work that way for everyone, but it did for me and I would say it is because of what a close shave you get with the razor.  I would recommend getting both the razor and gel as they work great together to give you a clean, close shave and leave your skin softer than it was when you started.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor. The Flexball gives a smooth shave. I don&#x27;t have to retrace my face to get all the hairs because of the combination of contour-conforming from the flexible head and because of the number of blades that don&#x27;t dull quickly. The razor even works on 5-day stubble (although I did have a bit of pulling. I also do not suffer from razor cuts or burns with this razor. The Proglide gel helps give me a comfortable shave. It goes on smooth, has just the right amount of lather, and rinses off easily. It has a nice fragrance that I wish would last slightly longer after showering, though. I received this razor (and a full-sized sample of the gel) for free as part of a promotion from Gillette.</li>
    <li> I had been a loyal Mach-3 razor guy for many years.  Decided to upgrade to the Fusion Proglide (manual) and really like it.  I know this is subjective, but I feel like these razors give me a slightly closer shave and do not irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> I think this new Gillette Fusion ProGlide  2-in-1 Gel with skin care is the best new product to come along in my lifetime for a smooth shave.  A tender face person such as I have to get a close shave but avoid the &amp;#34;shave rash&amp;#34; and this does the job.  I am planning on purchasing some as soon as I use up this one.  Matched with the Gillette ProGlide razor makes this one of the most comfortable shaves I can obtain.  As a Buzz Agent,  I received this a couple of weeks ago and have put it to the test and after over two weeks I am convinced in this new product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Gillette Fusion ProGlide FlexBall razor in the past, and I liked it.  Sadly, these blades are pretty expensive, so I didn&#x27;t buy refills.  When the opportunity presented itself to get one of these razors for free to try through BzzAgent, I jumped on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always loved the close shave I got with the FlexBall.  I&#x27;d regularly used the Fusion ProGlide Power razors, so I was already familiar with Gillette.  When I tried the FlexBall the first time, it was even better than the already-great results I got with the ProGlide Power razors.  However, I hadn&#x27;t used the shaving gel that came with my razor in the past.  I find it&#x27;s an even better shave with this gel than what I normally used (Schick, then Old Spice gel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that Costco sells the FlexBall refills in bulk, and because I got a $5 off coupon for blades with my FlexBall razor for this campaign, I&#x27;m going to purchase refills to use in the future.  Thanks for this opportunity, BzzAgent!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect for people who need a deal on some shaving cream and a shaver. Get it and you will not regret it</li>
