<li> I wear it just about everyday as my signature scent!</li>
<li> and I can&#x27;t believe how much less expensive it was here as compared to sephora.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this daily since I ordered it, even when I&#x27;m feeling lazy and it lasts all day without being insanely overbearing.</li>
<li> When i sprayed the perfume it smelled very weak so, I decided to have a cosmetic rep at Norstrms to compare what I received vs what was in the store.  </li>
<li> I often purchase base perfume from Dillards, Norstrms.  </li>

    <li> cannot get enough!!!!</li>
    <li> My number one go to fragrance. I get so many compliments.</li>
    <li> Just want I wanted!!!!!! Perfect &amp; can&#x27;t beat the price for that expensive perfume!!!!</li>
    <li> It is now my &amp;#34;personal&amp;#34; fragrance.  It will be my trademark instead of theirs.  Been wearing some of same fragrances for years, so this is new for me-but seems like I have always worn it. Love it.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my sister. Better than Coach Poppy Flower from my direct comparison. Long lasting and sure you&#x27;ll get compliments.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping.Great Smell.</li>
    <li> I often purchase base perfume from Dillards, Norstrms.  This time i decided to purchase through Amazon.  When i received the package the inside of the box label was cut out.  When i sprayed the perfume it smelled very weak so, I decided to have a cosmetic rep at Norstrms to compare what I received vs what was in the store.  She confirmed it was very weak.  I called Amazon to return the product,  but since is was considered flammable it couldn&#x27;t be returned.  Amazon refunded my credit card.  The product could have been an old sample, but not sure.</li>
    <li> Just as announced and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> The most gorgeous scent.</li>
    <li> I wanted to order Rosabotanica and made a mistake ordering this one. It is ok, but not as distinctive as Rosabotanica and does not last very long on my skin. Some people compared it to a Rose perfume by Hermes or Guerlain,  well, I&#x27;d rather buy the real thing from these perfumers.</li>

    <li> I had smelt this in sephora and loved it but didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on it, so after a couple months I found it here and ordered it, still pretty expensive, and I don&#x27;t like how it smells on me, but it deffintaly is a pretty/different smell.</li>

    <li> Love this perfume! Its perfect for all occasions.</li>
    <li> definitely not full strength!  you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Perfume is subjective. What I love you may not. So I will review the price and bottle.  Best price I have found on the web.  Also extremely fresh and would buy again.  In fact, I did.  Nice big bottle.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly as expected. I had gone to sephora and taken their little perfume personality test, which I normally would have thought was total garbage but all of the perfumes it lead me to smelled fantastic. This one was by far my favorite, I grabbed a sample from sephora and wore it all week before deciding that this was the only perfume I wanted to wear.

Definitely would purchase again and I can&#x27;t believe how much less expensive it was here as compared to sephora.</li>
    <li> The best perfume!!! Smells GREAT</li>
    <li> This is amazing, fresh, modern and completely different!</li>
    <li> My sister purchased this perfume from Saks for $130 and I can&#x27;t tell a difference in the strength.  I love it!</li>
