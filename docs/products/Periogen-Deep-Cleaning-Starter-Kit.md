      <li>My teeth feel much better in just a few days.</li>
      <li>Our teeth have not felt this clear without a dental visit.</li>
      <li>About the Periogen, I have come to use it directly on my tooth brush.</li>
      <li>For what it costs to purchase this product,  you could see a dentist for a professional treatment.</li>
      <li>I am a dental professional,  and I just read the ingredients.  </li>
      <li>I bought this for my 12 year old son who wears braces.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just surprised I don&#x27;t see this product on TV.</li>

      <li>I am using this to handle some dental issues so as to avoid a deep cleaning and so far, it is going well.  </li>
      <li>The last time I went to the dentist she had to use a numbing agent and suggested valium because my teeth and gums were so sensitive to the cleaning.</li>
      <li>and I also purchased the cross action vibrating toothbrush.</li>
      <li>It does not appear to do much besides other than add flavoring to the water in the water pic.</li>
      <li>I ordered this item because my dentist got on me a little more agressively than usual about flossing due to the fact that I had developed Gingivitis.</li>

<li> A complete waste of my money!</li>
<li> After a few days, I definitely noticed a difference in my teeth and gums.  </li>

<li> It was a bit odd</li>
<li> and I have significantly less tartar, and my teeth look whiter and feel cleaner as a result.  </li>
<li> I used it about half the time for about 7 weeks.</li>
<li> it melts your enamel away togather which causes toothache on cold and hot water...</li>
<li> I have used it a few times and feel it has helped.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months now, and can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed a difference.</li>
<li> Saw no improvement, and the water pik broke after a few months use.  </li>
<li> I was anxiously awaiting this because my gums were sore.  </li>
<li> At this cleaning, there was much less buildup and fewer areas with pockets and pocket depth decreased.</li>
<li> But I&#x27;ll keep plugging along, and perhaps it will kick in (at least to a point that I can tell it&#x27;s working).</li>
<li> Even my dentis was skeptical about that request.</li>
<li> After reading some of the reviews, I was a bit skeptical about the product, but tried it anyway.</li>
<li> I just wish the Periogen wasn&#x27;t so darn expensive.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I can highly recommend this product. I has worked just as advertised and I am very pleased with the results of using it.</li>
    <li> Do not buy it if you expect that this flower is going to change your life! A complete waste of my money!</li>
    <li> I floss, brush,and use a pre-rinse, but I still seem to get Tartar on my lower front teeth. I was just going to get a single bottle of Periogen to try after reading all the positive reviews. I saw this pack with 2 bottles of Periogen, and the Waterpik so I decided why not if it doesn&#x27;t work I would still have the Waterpik. The Periogen works great my Tartar started to break off after the first time I used it. It might be me but my teeth also seem whiter. Now I use it twice a day once in the morning, and once before I go to bed. I will definitely be making this part of my daily routine. I&#x27;m just surprised I don&#x27;t see this product on TV.</li>
    <li> I was really surprised that this product really does work!  I had a noticeable decrease in tartar in one month.  Will continue to use it, and would recommend others try it as well.</li>
    <li> I was going to exchange this for another unit.  First, the instructions tell you that the changeable tips have to be seated on the wand so there is no gap between where you snap on the tip and the wand..well, the unit I received left the gap.   Secondly, when I primed the unit, the motor sounded like it was going to give out. I went ahead and used it per instructions.  It was a bit odd but I figured it just took some getting used to. Also, for some reason, the instructions tell you to use it BEFORE you brush your teeth.  Anyway, I&#x27;ve used it a few times now and it seems that the motor is just loud..it works perfectly even with that gap. It is under warranty so if it breaks, I&#x27;ll be able to get a replacement. I bought the unit that came with the Periogen.  I have to say its kinda cool...it fizzes when you add it to the water and I think it adds to how clean your teeth feel afterwards.    I am sure I will be using this unit regularly and it won&#x27;t end up in the cabinet under the sink..</li>
    <li> I bought this to help with the tartar between dental visits.  I have used it a few times and feel it has helped. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about three weeks and I&#x27;m already noticing a difference...my dentist wants to do a deep scale cleaning and I&#x27;d like to avoid having tht done.  I&#x27;ll send another review after my next check up!</li>
    <li> This is the year of teeth, I am updating my oral department. This was a great tooth investment. the calculus and and tarter are coming off after two days. Please note the container holds two cups of water, that means two scoops of cleaner, not one. When I used two scoops I could feel the calculus coming off in front. My teeth feel much better in just a few days.</li>
    <li> I started using Periogen about halfway through my 4 month recall on periodontal cleaning. I used it about half the time for about 7 weeks. I had been on a 4 month recall for the last three cleanings because of inflammation and pocket depth. At this cleaning, there was much less buildup and fewer areas with pockets and pocket depth decreased. Because of the improvement, I was moved to a 6 month recall and told by the doctor to, \\&quot;Keep doing what I&#x27;m doing.\\&quot; That saves me $130 since my insurance only covers two cleanings per year. I didn&#x27;t tell them at this visit that I had started using Periogen because I want to use it daily for the 6 month interval and really get their attention.</li>
    <li> I had 3-5mm pockets in my gums and had to go to the dentist every 3 months.  I bought this &amp; used it 2x a day for 3 months.  My dentist was so happy with my healthy gums (no pockets at all) that I don&#x27;t have to go back for 6 months!</li>
    <li> I ordered this item because my dentist got on me a little more agressively than usual about flossing due to the fact that I had developed Gingivitis. I have been using the actual waterpik everyday and the periogen when I have a little more time to do so which is usually at night before bed. I can feel that my teeth are free of anything in between. With regard to the actual tartar build up in between I can&#x27;t really say since it&#x27;s just been a few weeks. My next dentist appointment is in June and I&#x27;m hoping that by using both products it will make my teeth cleaning experience much more pleasant. Will definitely update the feed after my visit. This is coming from someone that absolutely hates going to the dentist. *crossing fingers*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update on July 3, 2014: I just went to my regularly scheduled cleaning yesterday and I have to say I was so pleasantly surprised at how easy my visit went. The last time I went to the dentist she had to use a numbing agent and suggested valium because my teeth and gums were so sensitive to the cleaning. I immediately purchased this. I use the waterpik every week with the powder. I floss every day. I use pronamel consistently now and I also purchased the cross action vibrating toothbrush. When I went to the dentist yesterday I insisted she not use any numbing agents. Even my dentis was skeptical about that request. Guess what? Huge success! The cleaning was easy breezy! I highly suggest this. With those with an even more serious problem definitely use it everyday. My dentist still said I have some work, but she was surprised at how easy it was to clean my teeth and told me to keep doing what I&#x27;m doing because it&#x27;s working!</li>
    <li> Since the day I purchased this am using it. And its the best alternative to manual floss. My teeth looks fresh.</li>
    <li> I bought the Waterflosser 13 months ago and today it broke. I will replace it with another brand.</li>
    <li> This combo has certainly done the job for me. No plaque in a three month period. I did start with a cleaning. But the disclosing solution shows NO buildup. You can reduce your repeat pricing on the Periogen at drugstore.com. 80.00 for the first order. (Three bottles) And the auto renew similar to Amazon&#x27;s will get you an additional 10 off. Purchase points are returned to you for each purchase. My 80.00 first purchase got me 4.00 off next purchase in the next 30 days. Love the Waterpik  flosser!  UPDATE: About the Periogen, I have come to use it directly on my tooth brush. I experimented with letting my inside bottom teeth get neglected. Sure enough I got some build-up because I stopped using Periogen. Then I applied Periogen directly on the Cybersonic toothbrush and gently brushed letting the Periogen do its work. Using a lighted mirror to confirm (which you can purchase on Amazon), the build-up was gone! The point for me is that I don&#x27;t use it daily; usually once a week. You can save product by using this method.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months now, and can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed a difference. But I&#x27;ll keep plugging along, and perhaps it will kick in (at least to a point that I can tell it&#x27;s working).</li>
    <li> I am using this to handle some dental issues so as to avoid a deep cleaning and so far, it is going well.  I saw the dentist after using this for a couple of weeks and she could tell it was working.  I can also feel it very clearly!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 12 year old son who wears braces.  He now takes much better care of his teeth and his dentist/orthodontist have seen a tremendous difference.</li>
    <li> Got suckered in.  Saw no improvement, and the water pik broke after a few months use.  Oh well.  Buyer beware.  If it sounds too good to be true .............................</li>
    <li> After using daily through two bottles, there is not any noticeable change in the amount of tartar on my teeth. It does not appear to do much besides other than add flavoring to the water in the water pic.</li>
    <li> Our teeth have not felt this clear without a dental visit.</li>
    <li> I use it to clean my implant posts &amp; am very happy with the results! It&#x27;s a great combination of products.</li>
    <li> This seems to help gums stay healthy.  I will need to keep in around for good dental health.  I would like to always have good teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> I just wish the Periogen wasn&#x27;t so darn expensive.  They should offer a 1 year supply at a deep discount.  Not like I am likely to stop using it now.</li>
    <li> do not use periogen. just go dentist. it works but....!!!!!!  it melts your enamel away togather which causes toothache on cold and hot water... you will regret.!! but waterpick works super good. no complaints about that. only periogen</li>
    <li> After reading some of the reviews, I was a bit skeptical about the product, but tried it anyway. After a few days, I definitely noticed a difference in my teeth and gums.  It has been a month now and I have significantly less tartar, and my teeth look whiter and feel cleaner as a result.  The recession of the gum line also seems to be improving.  I would recommend the product for anyone who wants healthier teeth and gums.  It works for me.</li>
    <li> wish my dentist would have recomended this..of course they want you to keep padding thier wallets..anyway this product helped me right away..worth every penny</li>
    <li> Have been using this kit for about a month with no problems. I&#x27;m satisfied with the variety of tips included. I haven&#x27;t bought Perigean in a couple years, and I&#x27;m pleased to see that they now have a new measuring spoon that is long enough not to fall down into the bottle!</li>
    <li> Great value and the results are amazing.  I recommend this product without hesitation.</li>
    <li> Do not use this. I am a dental professional,  and I just read the ingredients.  Citric acid will promote enamel erosion,  leading to sensitivity and decay. For what it costs to purchase this product,  you could see a dentist for a professional treatment.</li>
    <li> I use supersmile product along with this kit. This is a great combo. My teeth feel like they have been to the dentist every morning.</li>
    <li> I am already a big fan of the waterpik, but I just recently started using the periogen powder.  I am a diabetic and I bought this kit as a replacement. The waterpik helps with my keeping my gums heathy.  I was anxiously awaiting this because my gums were sore.  I received it and have been using this for about 3 days now.  I have to say my gums are not sore any longer.  As far as keeping the tartar at bay I will add more info when I visit my dentist in April...</li>
