<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Came quickly, smells great!</li>
    <li> bought this for my GF, she loves the smell, for the price, you can go wrong!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my mom because she&#x27;s unable to find it anywhere else.      Good selection, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This was a very good buy. Absolutely love it</li>
    <li> The best perfume I have ever used.  The only scent I could use due to my daughter&#x27;s asthma.  Soft scent wouldn&#x27;t trigger her asthma.  Won&#x27;t use any other perfume.  A gift from my husband that has me using for the last 15 years.</li>
    <li> This spray is not at all overpowering.  It is a light and delicate floral that is perfect for daytime.  I do not find that the scent is as long lasting as some brands that are more costly, but for the price, it is a very good choice.</li>
    <li> I was kinda doubtful about purchasing perfume online, however I give Amazon a try and I am not disappointed. Got the perfume on time.  Splendor is a great ferfume for everyday work, I wear it to work on mornings and even though I work outdoor is hot temperatures it still smells crisp and clean on evenings after work.  I will definitely recommend and for less than $20.00 its a steal.</li>
    <li> I have worn this product for years, but even though it still smells fairly good, it doesn&#x27;t have the same quality aroma as it did before and fades away much faster...</li>
    <li> I loved this perfume. Not very strong and just the right note of pleasant. I guess this would always be a part of my collection</li>
    <li> I first used this perfume in my twenties and so glad to find it at such a reasonable price.  Spray twice and you are good to go for 16 hours!  Great price and prompt delivery!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I got this one for the first time. It reminds me of one of the best collections my Mother had when I was young. I have always loved its scent. I would definitely bucket this as an everyday wear.</li>
    <li> nice light fragrance, perfect for any occasion.</li>
    <li> Love the scent,price&amp;size of bottle really gets your money worth I got my first bottle of this purfume 3 years ago and always wanted another.  Look forward to purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> Elizabeth Arden is one of the brands that I really love. Subtle smell. This is so much value for my money because I only need to put some in my pulse points and that&#x27;s it for the whole day. Awesome product!</li>
    <li> My signature smell I&#x27;ve used for years hard to find but Amazon my go to place. Truly a ladies scent</li>
    <li> I have had so many compliments about the scent of this product on me. I have given the name to many also. I just love it &amp; will never change to another</li>
    <li> A fragrance that has never gotten old. I buy other fragrances for my wife but love this as her daily scent.</li>
    <li> Always on time and always meets expectations</li>
    <li> I have used Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s &amp;#34;Splendor&amp;#34; parfum spray for years, the product I received from Amazon&lt;br /&gt;was NOT &#x27;Splendor&#x27;....actually, there is little or no scent at all.  Thououghly disappointed with this product&lt;br /&gt;and will not reorder.  This is the first item I got through Amazon that was bad.</li>
    <li> Where other fragrances seem to fade after a short time, this fragrance has staying power and I always receive compliments on the scent.</li>
    <li> I enjoy Splendor and use it daily and has a great fixer even in the afternoon I have heard complements of the delicious and clean scent.</li>
    <li> May be a little too mature for me.  Would be a good scent for 50+</li>
    <li> Great price always. I purchase it for my mom all the time. It&#x27;s the 3oz which usually sells at retail store for double the price. For this price I would get the 1oz at the store. Great deal!</li>
    <li> WOULD BY THIS ANY TIME AND WEAR THIS PARFUM  ANY WHERE. WOULD TELL MY FRIENDS ABOUT THIS  PRODUCT. THANK YOU.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased by the packaging and the scent seems to be the original. Great price for that size.I would def buy this again and also recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I am not sure what happened to this product...perhaps it was altered, damaged or simply faked.  I have purchased this fragrance when it shows up at discount stores and always found it to be perfect.  The Amazon product was horrible smelling and even the color seemed very strange, as if the fragrance oils had seperated from other ingredients in the bottle.</li>
    <li> I despise this stuff, it stinks to the point where it is embarassing to wear it in public. Hideous strong gardenia, I never dreamed a so- called designer fragrance in this era could be this bad. I had a very embarassing experience attempting to wear this on vacation to an event and just had to leave and scrub. I couldn&#x27;t subject other people to it. Cheap for a reason, zero value.</li>
    <li> Horrrrrible it smells FAKE besides the color in yellow im pretty upset i will never buy it again</li>
    <li> This is was a great find for the price. I&#x27;ve worn Splendor for many years. It&#x27;s a lovely scent that isn&#x27;t over powering. Liz Arden makes some of my favorite.  Happy to find it on Amazon for less that store price, which is way too much.</li>
    <li> It smells a lot lighter than the ones I buy in stores.&lt;br /&gt;I have to use more of this to smell it.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume! Nicely priced and fast delivery!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this perfume!</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance. Nice packaging.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t buy perfume again online. I am not certain that this was the real thing but for some reason the fragrance was not the same as the original purchased at a department store.</li>
    <li> Huge bottle for the price.  Great smell!</li>
    <li> I love this product was delivered right away and great value and great price</li>
    <li> Smells awful like bathroom deodorizer!</li>
    <li> This perfume was received timely and new in package.  However, the efficacy of the scent is very short lived making it suspect that the product is old.  I love the scent it just does not stay long (maybe 15 minutes tops)!</li>
    <li> This is a light, fresh scent. Enjoy it alot, have reordered several times.</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift and it was enjoyed!  Great price and will keep looking to buy others. Love Elizabeth Arden products.</li>
    <li> this is my first time to order perfume online and i am very happy &#x27;coz my husband finds the perfume so nice to smell but  not that expensive and delivered on time... good job amazon!</li>
    <li> I used to buy this all the time and have seen it in the mall at the perfume stores but never bought it, till now. Still love the smell it was new in the box and loved the price Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing  Elizabeth Arden Splendor for years.  It&#x27;s a fresh scent that I wear every day.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this, my very favorite and I get so many compliments !</li>
    <li> I am so glad to get my hands on this parfum!  Elizabeth Arden does not make it anymore, I love the fresh smell and I always get comments when I wear it.  I was lucky to find it on Amazon</li>
    <li> My mom loves this fragrance and for a long time we thought it would be impossible to find because it was discontinued. So glad we were able to find it!</li>
    <li> Middle aged beauty here....takes me back to the 90&#x27;s everytime. Forever in love. Thanks for the great price, fast shipping, and having the item in stock.</li>
    <li> I took a chance and bought this for my dear friends birthday. The 45 positive reviews really helped with my decision. I was so relieved when she stated &amp;#34;Elizabeth Arden is my favorite&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Not for me!!  This Eau De Parfun smells so good on other people but not on me.  So this is thumbs down!!</li>
    <li> Great fragrance, great price. My aunt just loved it</li>
    <li> This is the best parfume Elizabeth Arden could ever make! I LOVE IT hope to keep being able to find it! Thank you Amazon for having it avalable !</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this fragrance since 1999 and I love it.  It stays sweet and fresh on me all day.  I have purchased this product several times thru Amazon, usually a few bottles at a time.  I have been pleased with the shipping, quality &amp; service every time.  I&#x27;m sure through the years the manufacturing has changed but I continue to be pleased with the fragrance and I always get compliments, almost DAILY, on this fragrance.  I usually avoid \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; or inexpensive fragrances -- but through the years, this product has never disappointed.  I also wear D&amp;G The One regularly (also a sweet fragrance on me), but Splendor is my daily favorite.  It&#x27;s just a great scent &amp; never turns sour on me like many others do.  I keep it stockpiled in case I can&#x27;t find it again!</li>
    <li> Amazon receives a 5 star. Product arrived as expected, and in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this fragrance. I’ve been wearing this scent since 2000. However this particular scent as with any fragrance is subject to the individual. I will add that when I where it, I do get compliments on it. The scent lingers but its not overpowering like other perfumes. This is an Oriental Floral fragrance. Enclosed are a couple of notes to help you decide. Wisteria, freesia, peony, hyacinth, sweet pea; magnolia, tea rose, lily, poppy, orchid, jasmine, sandalwood, amber, dark woodsy notes, musk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fragrance was hard to come by until I found it on Amazon (at a cheaper price). I was skeptical as another reviewer stated that it was delivered looking odd and the scent was off. My perfumed arrived and it was exactly the way that I remember it. Color and scent were perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this fragrance to anyone. I would describe this fragrance as floral, clean, sharp scent that is feminine. My daughter is 20 and she wears it too. Interesting that with all that fragrances out there my daughter wears mine… a lot!</li>
    <li> This is such a great scent.</li>
    <li> Classic sent ... Bought 4 bottles already love it</li>
    <li> Nothing special but ok for price.</li>
    <li> Just got this perfume today, and I am very pleased!  It has a delightful scent and I wiill be wearing it often, I&#x27;m sure!  After all, it&#x27;s Elizabeth Arden!</li>
    <li> Lovely fragrance, very mild and pleasing. I have been using it for a couple of years. Couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores when I ran out of it. Amazon has always amazed me with the products they have. The price was amazing as well. So I&#x27;m a very happy and satisfied customer, having found my favorite fragrance at Amazon at a fabulous price! Thank you.</li>
    <li> Elizabeth Arden is one of my favorite perfumeries, I consistently receive compliments whenever I wear her scents. Splendor is certainly true to it&#x27;s name.</li>
