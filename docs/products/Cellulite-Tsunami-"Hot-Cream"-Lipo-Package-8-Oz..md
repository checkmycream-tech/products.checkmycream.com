<li> The hot and cold combo helped produce results in just a few days!</li>
<li> However, it is not easy.</li>
<li> I try to go at least 3 times a week to the gym to try to stay in shape.</li>
<li> I was always lazy to do it!</li>
<li> Now I am not as active as I used to be and am having hard time finding time to workout, imagine my excitement when I saw that I can order Tsunami from Amazon!!!</li>
<li> I am now addicted to tsunami.</li>
<li> When I finish my workout routine, after bath I apply Tsunami cold gel to tone my skin.</li>

    <li> Love this product. Shipping was extremely fast; I got the products just a few days after ordering and began to use it right away. The hot and cold combo helped produce results in just a few days!</li>
    <li> I love Tsunami Cellulite Duo creams! I have used it for 2 months and I can&#x27;t live without it. They are so simple to use, and you notice results in less than 3 weeks. It is far less expensive than most cellulite creams. You feel the creams working right away. I&#x27;ve had cellulite on my upper hamstrings for about 4 years, and going to the gym wasn&#x27;t enough. My friend told me about Tsunami products and I am so thankful for her! I use it exactly how she taught me. In the morning I apply the hot cream by rubbing it in in circular motion and after I rub the cold slimming gel. It feels as if my body is burning while I am going by my daily routine. Then I go to the gym, shower and apply my hot cream and cold gel. This is my routine and it works :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used soo many creams and lotions in the past years wanting to get rid of the cellulite, but this one by far is the best one! A little goes a long way, which I love,, I have been using it for about 2 weeks now, and I am already noticing the difference, my skin is starting to feel more firmer already... This product will not disappoint...</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with the results received from this product. Considering I have been using it for only 3 weeks now, I have lost about 3 inches, and beginning to look a bit firmer than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on continuing to use this product to achieve maximum result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend as long as you are religious about using it. Meaning-- applying it daily with of course a diet and exercise regimen. It works, it really does.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for cellulite cream everywhere and decided to give this one a chance since it has great reviews. It was worth every penny! I started seeing results within a week. This is my second week using it and results are only getting better! I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I like Tsunami Mix. It is different that everything I tried before. My skin is more smooth and I can tell cellulite is less visible.</li>
    <li> I was very active woman before my knee injury two years ago.  My body started to change.  Cellulite and stretch mark were noticeable more and more. Now, I have been using Tsunami cream and gel for two weeks and my cellulite and stretch marks are much less noticeable.  I am happy to use Tsunami as my beauty daily routine.  Never thought that this type of product would work on me.</li>
    <li> I am very glad that i finally found a product that actually works.  Many thanks to one of my friends who introduced me to Tsunami cosmetics products</li>
    <li> Awesome products, works right away no joke!!! I was so happy with the results!!!!</li>
    <li> After trying different products, I have to say that Tsunami Cosmetics product works.  I can see that my cellulite and stretch marks are less visible. I am very happy with it and I truly recommend it.</li>
    <li> REALLY WORTH to buy if you have a problem with cellulite!!! I&#x27;m 32 and yes, I got cellulite! It&#x27;s been 2 weeks since I started with Tsunami and I have to say that this is the BEST Product EVER!!! My fine lines are getting less visible and my skin is never been this smooth and soft. Also, I love the fact that these creams doesn&#x27;t require massaging and rubbing into my skin. I was always lazy to do it! I simply apply HOT cream before my workout. After the shower, I apply COLD lotion which smells GREAT and makes my skin so silky. I love that burn of the HOT cream and it seems like it really works!!! I just apply HOT &amp; COLD mixed together when I skip the gym. I&#x27;ve been using a couple of brands for years, but I have never had this positive feeling and I definitely recommend it to everyone!!!</li>
    <li> I’ve been using this product for a while now and I love it! First of all i love the feeling that the hot cream gives because i can actually feel it while it’s working it’s magic. Other thing is that it tightens the skin immediately so the appearance of cellulite is visibly reduced. Great when you need to look your best on a special occasion.&lt;br /&gt;Price is more that affordable and I received it only couple of days after i ordered. Instructions how to use it were really clear. I think this is a great company that really cares about its customers.&lt;br /&gt;Overall feeling is an A+ and i would definitely recommended it to any women out there who is, like me, struggling with the cellulite.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! After 7 days of usage, I could already see the significant difference: the cellulite was almost invisible, and the strech marks started to fade. I could not believe that for this price you can great such an amazing product...I exercise so much, but still cellulite represents big problem for me: but thanks god I saw this product and I decided to buy, because my enemy no. 1: cellulite is going away. Thank you so much! Fast shipping, and excellent product! :)</li>
    <li> Wow! What an amazing product! The Tsunami line is awesome! My cellulite is gone and my skin is smooth and clear. I would definitely recommend to my family and friends. Thank you!</li>
    <li> So happy I have found Tsunami anti-cellulite cream AGAIN! As a professional athlete for many years I&#x27;ve tried to find a product that will prevent and minimize appearance of cellulite and this was the most efficient and the least expensive product I&#x27;ve found on a market. Now I am not as active as I used to be and am having hard time finding time to workout, imagine my excitement when I saw that I can order Tsunami from Amazon!!! It&#x27;s been only few weeks and I am already placing second order, because results are more than obvious! Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with Tsunami. I am 37 year old and my energy is not the same as when I was in my 20s. In addition, the appearance of cellulite is more noticeable with time. I try to go at least 3 times a week to the gym to try to stay in shape. However, it is not easy. When I heard about Tsunami hot and cold combo and how it works, I decided to order it. I am now addicted to tsunami. I applied tsunami hot cream before going to the gym on my stomach and my thighs. Tsunami hot feels like having a portable sauna every time I go to the gym. When I finish my workout routine, after bath I apply Tsunami cold gel to tone my skin. In two weeks, I&#x27;ve seen results in my body plus tsunami has a bonus; Tsunami leaves the skin feeling so soft and radiant. Tsunami has become my workout partner.</li>
