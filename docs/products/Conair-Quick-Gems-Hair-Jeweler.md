<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I had purchased these a few years ago for granddaughters. And have another granddaughter now who used theirs but didn&#x27;t have one  of her own, so bought this one for her.  Once you get the hang of using these, they are so easy and simple and young girls just love them.  I bought extra jewels as well, because young girls just can&#x27;t have too many!&lt;br /&gt;I doubt really young girls can use these own their own, but moms and grandma&#x27;s can do it for them!</li>
    <li> My 4 year old daughter LOVES this (and, I&#x27;m not gonna lie - I&#x27;ve actually thought about trying this on myself; so far I&#x27;ve resisted). It&#x27;s really simple to use (for an adult, although I bet a 7 or 8 year old girl can probably handle it as well). The gems do a great job of staying in and so far I haven&#x27;t hit any major snags getting them out of my daughter&#x27;s hair. Her hair isn&#x27;t super thick so that might have something to do with it. If you&#x27;re going to buy this product, I&#x27;d suggest picking up [[ASIN:B003XIEYNK Conair HJ3RP Replacement Pack, 0.033 Pound]]; I&#x27;m constantly losing the gems so it&#x27;s nice to know it&#x27;s easy to pick up more when they&#x27;re all gone.</li>
    <li> My daughter plays with this all the time.  I love that it is so easy to use.  We even tried it on the dog.  Beautiful.</li>
    <li> 10 year old really liked it and didn&#x27;t have any trouble using it</li>
    <li> cool, neat idea. Easy to use, read instructions, and inform your daughter of them as well, for ease of use. Cute!</li>
    <li> This has been working well for us.  You do have to get the hang of doing it in order to get the gems in so they don&#x27;t slide out prematurely.  My daughter complains that the gems are heavy but she is a picky kid about her comfort.  I think this is a really cool gadget to have if your kid likes bling!</li>
    <li> I picked this for my granddaughter and she loves it. I shipped it directly to her and she has loved using it ever since!</li>
    <li> My daughter got this as a Christmas gift from Santa. She has enjoyed putting the gems in her hair. It takes a time or two to figure out that you can not put a lot of hair into each little clip. Each time we use the product we loss one clip because the spring breaks. Those are pretty minor and expected for this type product.  I think it was worth the money and she is still using it.</li>
    <li> the conair quick gems device is a great product!  it places the gems in your little girls hair with ease and they stay in for many hours with easy removal..little if any pulling to remove gems.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical about this product but got it for my daughter since she would be paying for it with her allowance money. I was happily surprised to see how well made and easy it was for her to use. She is nine and is just getting into styling her hair and she was able to use this over and over again. The pieces go on the hair quickly and stay on well. She can&#x27;t wait to have some of her friends over and style their hair as well!</li>
    <li> My five year old got this as an early Christmas present from someone and it really works.  The jewels look great in her hair and they stay in all day.  You can re-use them.  It really is unique and fun.</li>
    <li> This is a fun gadget for little girls.  My 6 and 5 year olds love it.  The gems are easy to remove from hair, and reuseable.  The protective cover over the beads continuously breaks off from the jeweler, but that doesn&#x27;t affect its performance.</li>
    <li> Looks ok for the money</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 11 year old granddaughter and I am glad that I did.  It was purchased at a very reasonable price, was delivered quickly and made a hit.&lt;br /&gt;The machine comes with 18 gems and is ready to go.  All you do is place your hair in the machine, you hold down the button, let it go and it places the gem on the hair.  Easy to take off as well, you just slide it off and can reuse it anywhere you want to.  They really make the hair look pretty, at least on younger girls and women, maybe not so pretty on us grandma&#x27;s, but who knows :))...&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it was a hit and I recommend this as a good price gift for any young girl that you know who enjoys a little hair beauty.  Also, not as hard to use as those colored strips that are glued on the hair and can cause allergies.&lt;br /&gt;Good product....</li>
    <li> My 6-year-old wanted a different toy which included temporary hair color streaks, but after reading very poor reviews of that one, I searched a bit and found this.  It&#x27;s so easy to use that she can bejewel my hair herself.  So far no one has had a jewel fall out, and as long as we follow directions to stretch the spring when removing jewels from hair, there have been no difficulties there either.  (Each jewel piece is really two jewels, held together back-to-back by a small metal spring in between them.)  I have some velcro hair jewels lying about, but these are nicer because they don&#x27;t fall out and because they are double-sided.  The hot pink, turquoise, white and clear colors go great with most everything in my daughter&#x27;s (and her 3-year-old sister&#x27;s) wardrobe.</li>
    <li> I bought this item as a stocking stuffer for christmas and she loved it. However, i was not in love with it as much as she was. The beads are reusable but i can not find the replaceable beads for the product for when she looses a peice. There where not any extra beads to go along with the product. It was simple to operate and that was the best thing about this product.</li>
    <li> granddaughter loved it, and it came fast!</li>
    <li> The gems were easy enough to put in but my daughters hair quickly got tangled up in the gem prongs.  We didn&#x27;t use it again.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it.  Of course, the gems are difficult to keep track of but replacement gems are available for less than $10.</li>
    <li> I got this for my 8th birthday from my Uncle.  It is great.  The jewells stay in for hours.  You can&#x27;t feel them and they work really well.  I think you should buy this product.</li>
    <li> This is exactly as advertised. However - one caveat - buy the extra gems. It just doesn&#x27;t come with that many of them, and expecting young kids to be responsible enough not to lose the 12 - 15 (or however many) that come with the package is just...not realistic IMO. It&#x27;s great that they are re-usable, but I want my daughter to have fun with them, and I don&#x27;t want either of us to have to obsessively count them at the end of the day! I want her to wear them to school and feel free to lose a few. So yes, I guess I will be ordering the additional gems. It&#x27;s a totally wonderful product. A little girl&#x27;s dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update***&lt;br /&gt;Well, it&#x27;s been over four years since I bought this product and I still have it, my daughter still uses it and I did end up buying the extra gems. Although, when I first ordered this product I could buy a large bag of extra gems for next to nothing it turns out that now they are only sold in small quantities (about the same amount that come with the initial package) and they cost a bit more. Even with that change, I still love the product. I logged on today to buy one as a birthday gift for one of the little girls in my daughter&#x27;s dance group. I&#x27;m going to find and buy her some extra gems too, because these things get lost easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say though, they do not fall out of my daughter&#x27;s hair, they have to be carefully pulled out. Her hair is very thick, not fine, so that may have something to do with it, but we have never lost a gem due to it falling out while she was wearing it. The little machine puts them in well and they stay until we remove them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my review helped you will you please click the &amp;#34;Yes&amp;#34; button below?</li>
    <li> I have two daughters ages 4 and 7. They love the look of the gems in their hair. It is easy to operate. My 7 year old can operate the machine without assistance. She specifically requested it for her birthday and seems to be very happy with it. It works well on different types of hair. My 7 year old has hair down to her waist that is wavy. My 4 year old has very curly ear length hair. All in all a fun gift for girlie girls.</li>
    <li> This was a birthday gift for a 16 year old and she was very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my grandchild&#x27;s Christmas, and is the perfect gift for a tween with long hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 14 year old granddaughter who loves working with her hair.  She has waist length hair and loves this tool.  Especially the fact that all of the &amp;#34;jewels&amp;#34; are removable from the hair and reusable!  And the price was good for what it is.</li>
    <li> We got this for my 5-year-old daughter for Christmas because she LOVES to play dress up.  It&#x27;s a cute little addition to her various princess costumes, and it has always worked great.  She is too young to use it herself, but it literally takes seconds, so it&#x27;s not big deal for me to do it for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that I don&#x27;t like about it is that it&#x27;s hard to get the jewel facing the direction you want.  You kind of just have to go with the flow, which is totally fine for a 5-year-old&#x27;s play time.  Older girls who are using it for fashion might get frustrated with that.</li>
    <li> Have not had a chance to try as this item will be a Christmas gift to granddaughter. Shipping was fast, and packaged well. Will be fun to try it!</li>
    <li> Works great!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I got this for kids. It is very easy to use on them but  needs lot practice to use on self.</li>
    <li> This seemed like a fairly easy item to use. Put your hair in the slot, push the button and your Gem clips onto your hair. The only problem is these clips are spring loaded so if you think you are going to remove them without losing any hair you have another lesson to learn. You can easily pry these gems open to remove them but your hair will be tightly wound around the spring and there is no way to get these gems off without ripping out your hair. It is best to use these on other items besides your hair, a purse, doll, etc. So the product is nice, just not meant for hair.</li>
    <li> Purchased the Conair Quick Gem for our 7 year old daugther at Christmas.  It was at the top of her Christmas list.  It is very easy to use.  I was surprised when my daughter was able to use it without any help.  Overall it&#x27;s a great product.  The gems are hard to remove without pulling out a hair or two.  Practice will problably help this small problem.  Overall, a fun purchase!</li>
    <li> This product was exactly what I had imagined.  It is pretty durable, the gems are completely reusable (I was afraid they were real flimsy and could only be used a few times each - but I was very wrong).  My daughter has very thick, frizzy hair and this product worked well with it.  She has yet to complain of any getting too stuck in hair.  The gems make great accents to some of her pretty little outfits.  I would say it is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> My 8 year old daughter really enjoyed putting the gems into her hair. The one negative to it, is it is just a spring that affixes itself in your hair and that tends to pull her hair out when she goes to remove the gems.</li>
    <li> This may look pretty cool, but it really is not as easy as it looks.  We&#x27;ve attempted this several times and as they demonstrate this tool on the commercials and in the directions... well it never comes off as easy, nor does it happen quite as smoothly.  Maybe we&#x27;re just &#x27;quick gem&#x27; morons, but we sure can&#x27;t get it figured out. Generally using this product leads to tangled hair and tears.  My 9 year old has long, fairly thick hair, and when we have had semi-success the gems that came with it were so few they were pretty much un-noticeable, so we purchased more jewels.  I&#x27;d say don&#x27;t waste the money!</li>
    <li> My 7 year old has asked for this many times but I was hesitant to buy it because I didn&#x27;t figure it would work as well as they showed on TV.  I caved and bought it for Christmas after seeing many good reviews online.  I will have to agree, it worked just as described and was very easy to use on the first try. It is Christmas morning and she currently has every gem in her hair.  Excellent purchase!</li>
    <li> My daughter (6 years) loves this. It is easy to insert the jewels into the hair and they stay put. Be careful when taking them out as you may damage the hair, but with some care it goes off okay. Great product.</li>
    <li> Quick Gems is a HIT!  My daughter is six years old and very much about her hair these days.  The gems go in easily and remove without much of a fuss.  Her hair is longer so you can&#x27;t just yank them out but if you take your time it slides right off.  I can see us using these over and over for a fun variety of styles.  It&#x27;s too bad that Santa gets all the credit for this one.</li>
    <li> I bought this gem styler for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it. It is easy to use. It just did not come with all the accessories from the TV ad but I bought a pouch and I may need to buy more gems.  I definitely recommed this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a present for my 8 year old niece, who loved it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PACKAGING / CONTENTS&lt;br /&gt;What you see in the pictures is what you get - the purple tool with the jewels in it, plus a few extra jewels. I was I guess expecting it to come in a box or something, but it came in a blister pack style package with a big \\&quot;AS SEEN ON TV\\&quot; emblem on the top.  For me, that emblem doesn&#x27;t make me think quality. Not that I thought this was going to be amazing quality for the price, but as a gift it kinda gave off a &#x27;I bought this on my way over at Walgreens&#x27; feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW IT WORKS&lt;br /&gt;You take a lock of hair, place it in the groove that is sticking off the circle and pull the trigger. It puts the jewel in the lock of hair. My niece had absolutely no problems operating it and within 10 minutes the entire family was bejeweled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REMOVAL&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen other reviews that say they were hard to get out, but they didn&#x27;t seem to be for us.  My daughter, my SIL and my niece all put them in and removed them without any complaint. The jewels are then reusable for another application. They are small though and can easily get lost, but you can buy replacements by themselves: [[ASIN:B003XIEYNK Conair HJ3RP Replacement Pack, 0.033 Pound]] (although the price on them as I write this is outrageous)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;QUALITY&lt;br /&gt;The picture of the jewels is a bit misleading. This is why I am taking off one star. It looks like they are made of metal when in fact the &#x27;settings&#x27; are plastic painted silver. Like many things made like this for this kind of price point they aren&#x27;t made terribly well and the black plastic often shows through the silver, etc.  The children hardly care about this and for the price it is to be expected. However, they definitely didn&#x27;t take a picture of the jewels we got in the package, which is very misleading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL&lt;br /&gt;This is a very fun toy, my niece and daughter really liked it. The quality isn&#x27;t great and the packaging leaves something to be desired, but overall I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Works great - just as described. I got it for a 5-year-old girly girl, and she loves it. It&#x27;s easy for her to use the jeweler to place the gems in her hair, and it&#x27;s easy for her to remove them and put them back in the jeweler for re-use.</li>
    <li> My daughter was so excited to get this after seeing a commercial.  The little charms got all tangled in her hair, lost easily and now sits in a bin in her room. :(</li>
    <li> What a cute idea to put jewels in girls&#x27; hair!  They stay in if you have the right amount of hair sectioned off.  And boy do they stay in!  You might pull a few strands out when trying to get them out of your hair.  Still, a great alternative to wearing to school when you can&#x27;t color your hair or wear feathers.  :-)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my granddaughter&#x27;s birthday. She hasn&#x27;t received it yet but my friend&#x27;s daughter saw this, has one, and said my DGD will love it and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
    <li> My five year old LOVES her hair jewles.</li>
    <li> Gems easily fall out if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
    <li> WOW! I can&#x27;t believe how great this thing is! It is so easy to use and the jewels are really nice! They look super cool in my daughters hair and come out easily. Even my 3 year old can use this with minimal hair pulling</li>
    <li> My 7 year old daughter got this for Christmas and it was the biggest hit at the party. She shared her gems with all the &#x27;ladies&#x27; that were happy to be bedazzled. They went on pretty easy and once we got the hang of taking them off, they came off easily too.  I can see that she will lose a couple along the way but now they sell replacements.</li>
    <li> The product does exactly as advertised.  It is easy to use and made my granddaughter happy.  Getting the jewels out of the hair is easily accomplished if patience is used and especially so if a third hand is available!</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loved it. I bought it for her Christmas present and she is 9 years old. So far so good.</li>
    <li> Great product, but beware that it is is not in retail box - if you want it for a gift, just a heads up.  Works great, is brand new, seller is great, but maybe not a best choice for a gift because of the packaging.</li>
    <li> The Hair Jeweler itself worked wonderfully on my daughter&#x27;s long (straight) hair!  The gems stay in well and slide out easier than I imagined possible since there is a tiny spring inside each gem.  I would have given the product 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t so hard to find replacement gems.  The gems ARE reusable but in time the spring will stretch and they won&#x27;t work anymore....or you&#x27;ll lost them 1 by 1...and before you know it you have a product that works GREAT but no gems to put in it.  Which is where we are now.....</li>
    <li> Pleased with purchase.</li>
    <li> Watch out for gems getting stuck when trying to get them out of your little girl&#x27;s hair.  While the gems go in nice and smoothly, getting them out can sometimes be a pain...literally.  There were a couple of times when I had to very gingerly work the gems out of my daughter&#x27;s hair, because if I wasn&#x27;t careful, I would have been pulling her hair out with the gems.  She seems to love it, though, and as I said, the gems go in very easily.  Just be careful when removing them!</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my grandaughter (She&#x27;s 8) This product was an absolute hit .It worked very well, was easy to understand and kept her imagination going. 5 Stars</li>
    <li> My 8 yo daughter just HAD to have this for Christmas, but I was really skeptical about how it would work.  Boy, was I pleasantly surprised!  The gems goes on easily, stay in the hair (she has almost waist length straight locks), and come out easily with no pulling when you&#x27;re done for the day.  And an added bonus is that it&#x27;s quick and easy to use, so we could even do it before school (on special days).  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My 7 yr old daughter got this for Christmas.  I was pleasantly surprised when this actually worked the way it shows!  It&#x27;s very simple, she does it without any help.  She can load, apply, and remove them.  They look very nice.  I wish it would come with a few more different style beads and maybe more.  The good thing is you can reuse them so they are not wasted after one use.  I would recommend this to anyone and would buy again!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 9 year old since the girls are really into temporary hair coloring, etc. so I thought she would enjoy it. She and her friends really like it.  It&#x27;s very simple to use and the gems are really easy to load and take out of the hair.  You need to put a decent amount of hair in the clip otherwise it will slide out but if it does, it doesn&#x27;t hurt.  She also uses it on her AG dolls so we&#x27;ve gotten some mileage out of it.</li>
    <li> File this under PRODUCTS THAT WORK!!!  And do what they say they will do.  I was skeptical when my daughter got this as a gift a few years ago, but pleasantly surprised.  Its easy. It stays in the hair.  It looks gorgeous in the hair. Its fun. They have never gotten tangled in my daughters hair (I suppose it could happen, but I havent found it to be a problem).  When I have had a problem with using it - I just needed to put in fresh batteries to make it work better.  Also found it is best to use very very thin strips of hair.  I think this would make a great gift for girls.  Dont be afraid to give this one a try!!!</li>
    <li> This is just OK. the crystals are not secure in the hair and after a few hours of play they fall out of my 6 years hair. They are reusable, but only if you are very careful taking them out. Which my daughter is not.</li>
    <li> My 6 year old absolutely loves this!  It&#x27;s so easy to use and the gems are reusable.  Seems well made.</li>
    <li> We purchased this product for our daughters for Christmas and just tried it out today.  They love the look of the jewels in their hair and it is very easy to use.  Make sure you do not use too much hair, because the jewels cannot hold alot of hair.  The jewels come out of their hair easily too.  They can pull them out themselves.  We love it!</li>
    <li> This product is quick and easy to use. The gems stay in all day...under most circumstances. My daughter and her friends absolutely love it. I would recommend getting the refills so you have extra on hand for a girls party, play or dance rectial.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved this jeweler! It made our day brighter. It&#x27;s a real fun and it looks beautiful on hair.</li>
    <li> Easy to use so much fun and does exactly what it it&#x27;s suppose to. I would buy this for any little girl as a gift!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for Christmas for my 3 girls all under 10 years old.  They loved it and we have had a lot of fun decorating their hair.</li>
    <li> Very easy to operate, my girls love to fix each others hair.  Make sure you get extra beads, they will want to try it out on your hair also.</li>
    <li> This device is super cool, the girls love it. They feel amazing with all the gems in their hair. Two minor cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) Is a little uncomfortable when removing the gems.&lt;br /&gt;2) It brings only 30 gems (or so) so make sure you saved them! Are reusable!</li>
    <li> Bought two for granddaughters at Christmas and they love it.  They are 8 and 11 and having fun decorating their hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered them for my daughter. She loves these . Also we ordered another set for her friends birthday.  thanks</li>
    <li> This worked great.  Super easy and it was perfect for my 9 year old.  She loved it.  I like that the jewels can be reused too!</li>
    <li> I am so glad I ordered this for my 9 year old Granddaughter for Christmas.  This was a big hit, she loved it.  It&#x27;s very sturdy and I think will hold up.  Simple to operate. The jewels go onto the hair easily, my granddaughter very quickly was using it on her own hair and then, her Aunts hair and her big sisters hair😀.  The jewels stay in without falling out, yet when you want to take them out of your hair they come out easily, with no pulling or any hair damage.  What more could you ask?  They look nice in the hair too.&lt;br /&gt;It takes 2 AAA battery&#x27;s to operate and does not come with battery&#x27;s.  The jewels are very simple to load into the machine.  The price is reasonable.  The 9 year old got many other gifts Christmas Day, but the Conair HJ3BC Quick Gems Hair Jeweler was the big hit, with her.  I have been asked by the 9 year old to please order more gems for her, which thankfully Amazon carrys as well.  So I am happy to order some more.  I ordered this a bit late for Christmas, but happily it was shipped quickly and got to me in time for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, if any one is sitting on the sidelines wondering if this is a good item for a young girl, I would urge you to order one.  It&#x27;s good quality, easy to use , does not damage the hair at all, very easy to take out of the hair, yet stays in well when applied and the price is reasonable.  I am so happy I got it for my Granddaughter and was so happy to see how much fun she had with it.  I know she is going to wear some &amp;#34;jewels &amp;#34;in her hair, the first day back to school after Christmas, and best of all, she will be telling her friends her Nona bought it for her😊</li>
    <li> I nearly didn&#x27;t buy this product because someone here on amazon stated &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34; that it was spring loaded and will pull hair out when removing. Well, my comment on that is BRUSH YOUR HAIR! If your hair is brushed you should have no issues removing this product. All you do is pull the gems apart and slowly pull to take them out. You can&#x27;t tell me you&#x27;ve never had a hair pin tug at your hair once in awhile when trying to remove, or even a hair tie at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this product is a bit annoying in the beginning. It doesn&#x27;t come with the batteries installed you will need your own batteries. The annoying part is the compartment to put the batteries in are closed with a screw. Which ok no biggie right? Wrong...the screw is sooooo tiny a regular Phillips will not do the job. You need a very thin tipped Philips to get the job done. If you do not have this handy you will not be able to use your product right away. This is why I take away 1 star. If it wasn&#x27;t for this I would&#x27;ve given it a 5 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you get past that part the product is very simple and easy to use. The jewels come preloaded, however the extra jewels does not come with a case so you will need something to put them in. All you do is take a small strand of hair and place it in the hook area. You need to hold your hair into the compartment and simply push the button and release once the jewel is in place. You don&#x27;t want to take the strand out till after you let go of the button and the thing that pushes the jewel into the hair goes back into place. I notice if you take the hair out before hand the jewel doesn&#x27;t really get pushed into place properly.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this was helpful!</li>
    <li> So Flipping cute! She is going to love it! ITs a christmas gift. She has long hair which is perfect</li>
    <li> My niece really loved her hair jewler,,,she uses it daily</li>
    <li> we did not know how to use it</li>
    <li> Got for a tween granddaughter. I thought this was a better idea than other things - she of course wanted makeup. I thought this was cute more than mature and it is by Conair so I thought it would be made well. She liked it - not sure Dad did!</li>
    <li> It worked easily and the gems stayed in till my daughter removed them. They are reusable too so you don&#x27;t have to keep buying them if they don&#x27;t throw them out. Very cute and easy to use.</li>
    <li> My niece, 7, had trouble trying to use this on her own. Also, her hair, while thick, was too soft/smooth for the gems. They kept sliding out.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it! its very easy to use so easy i dont have to do it for her!! the reuseable jewels are great thank goodness or id have to buy new ones already shes used it so much!! the price was remarkable too,i price checked just about everywhere and i couldnt find it for a better price than this!!</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised! A fun product with re-usable &amp;#34;gems&amp;#34; that my 10 year old daughter can use herself!  Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this to play dress up.  She can use it without help and does not have any problem getting the beads out.</li>
    <li> You can do your hair the way you like and add gemstones to really set it off.it is fun and pretty for females of all ages I am so glad I ordered it.</li>
    <li> my seven year old got this for Christmas and loves it. Its easy to use and the gems are reusable...great price too</li>
    <li> My daughter got this for Christmas and I was a bit nervous since she has very long curly hair and I was afraid these jewels were going to get stuck in her hair.&lt;br /&gt;It very easily places the gems in her hair she can do it herself (she&#x27;s 8 yo), and her sisters loved it also.They stay in her hair well.  You can also remove them fairly easily by gently separating the spring in the jewel.  My only complaint is the gems are small and easily lost and the spring gets stretched out after several applications.  I am going to look for additional gems which would be worthwhile to buy if they sell them separately.</li>
    <li> My daughter got this for christmas. We gave it as a gift last year and the little girl we gave it to loved it!  And she has had it for a year and she still uses it!  My daughter got hers christmas of 2013 and she loves it!  She is 9,and has no problem using it!  I didn&#x27;t even have to show her how.  And she gets lots of compliments when she wears it to school!  It really does look pretty with the gems in it, and she has used the gems over ans over again so far!  Great item, great investment!</li>
    <li> Works even better than expected.  We love this product.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a young girl, she had a great time with it.</li>
    <li> So disappointing for my daughter to use it only once and then have it quit. The wheel stopped rotating. No motor sounds whatsoever. Changed out brand new batteries again. Still nothing. Plus it arrived with the screw for the battery area stripped so it was very difficult to install batteries in the first place. Nice idea.</li>
    <li> This works like a bomb, more jewels needed in package</li>
    <li> my package came open and some of the beads were out of the package!!!!!!!!!!! how am i suppose to gift this????</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really great toy and I&#x27;m 10 and i think it&#x27;s fun. You should buy it but don&#x27;t loose the beads or than the toy won&#x27;t be as fun but avaral it&#x27;s FANTASTIC!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 8 year old and she loves it!  The beads go in easy and just pull beads apart and slide hair out when you are ready for them to come out!  I have been really impressed with the simplicity of the item.  Its easy for little fingers to use and the beads are reusable.  Was a hit with her friends when she had her birthday party :)  Would definitely purchase extra beads for special occasions.</li>
    <li> only issue i had is the packaging was opened then stapled shut !!! so i hope all is there as this will be a gift for christmas!!</li>
    <li> My girls love it. easy and fun.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 6 year old daughter because she loves jewels!  We put some in her hair right away &amp; they looked real cute. Unfortunately due to her age, I think she didn&#x27;t like having something attached to her hair so we took them out.  It was very simple to use &amp; something &amp;#34;fun&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Works great. Exactly like the picture and description. I might purchase again as gifts for nieces or friends&#x27; birthday gifts.</li>
    <li> Great product, easy to use and stylish, but beware: Once you take the gems out, it&#x27;s a pain to put them back in the hair jeweler. Make sure to not leave any of the gems out, as they could be a choking hazard to small children. Apart from that, I love this product!</li>
    <li> Will be Xmas present, so hope it is what she expects.</li>
    <li> Th battery back is a little hard to get back on, but it was fun and easy to get these in my daughters hair.</li>
    <li> My 4 1/2 daughter is a girly girl &amp; loves this product. I was a little leery about getting it after seeing some of the reviews but am very glad I ordered it. The price really isn&#x27;t that bad considering you can reuse the gems over &amp; over. At the end of the day she wants the gems out and can slide them out of her hair all by herself. Once in a while a few strands of hair come out too but she doesn&#x27;t seem to care (maybe because it&#x27;s straight). It&#x27;s a fun product that adds a few sparkles to her hair &amp; is a lot of fun.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as a gift for my daughter. Although she loves using it on her hair and her dolls, I don&#x27;t think the gems clip into your hair that well. Then you have to manually reload it. All in all it wasn&#x27;t too expensive and my daughter likes it.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loves this thing. I need to get more &#x27;jewels&#x27; for it.</li>
    <li> We really like this but wish the replacement jewels were less costly....it&#x27;s fun for a little while...until the jewels are gone, which does not take long.</li>
    <li> I bought this to carry to the beach for my nieces to use. I unpacked around 10 pm the night we arrived. When I gave it to them they had a fit(just the reaction I wanted). The fit of joy turned into disappointment when we discovered it wouldn&#x27;t work without batteries, would have been nice to know before hand. We had to go buy a screwdriver set and batteries at 11pm on the beach. They did have a ball after that though. They even dazzelled the baby dolls hair:)</li>
    <li> bought this for our 2 girls ages 8 &amp; 5 and they absolutely love it. It is very easy to use and also very easy to take out of hair. The gems look absolutely adorable in their hair. We are very pleased.</li>
    <li> Dis thing make my hair so pretty. i love it. if you want yer hair prettay like meee, get dis thign.. it werks! I did it tew mah dog too, she love her fur to get prettay and jewelryed out like hannah montana@! if u likehanna montana u can try to message me shje is sooooooooo cewl! gimme a ring k?</li>
    <li> My daughter HAD to have this, but is hard to do yourself.  Make sure there is someone around that feels confident in hairstyling because it is still a bit tricky to get it to look cute.  Very fun though.  Gems stay in if you get just the right amount of hair.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. I wish there were more gems that come along with it. Also, it does pull hair during removal.</li>
    <li> My 6 year old loves this and can use it by herself. The sparkly gems go in easily and come out without ripping her hair out. Very cute. Buy the extra pack of gems. You&#x27;ll want/need more.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the young at heart</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for two granddaughters who have enjoyed the creativity.</li>
    <li> i could not open it to put batteries in because the screw was stripped when we opened it like somone tried to open it alreadyy.  dont know if i can dend back because we bought it around christmas for my daughter</li>
    <li> Received it yesterday. Thank you! Works very well.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as my niece&#x27;s birthday gift.  She loved it and had fun playing with her little sister having girly time together.  It&#x27;s easy and fun.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these and they are a good time killer while playing dress up or make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t seem to stay in the hair too well, but I think it&#x27;s because they are meant to be easily removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> This is as I expected. Really good!!</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both used this on our hair. Her hair is really thick and the gems stayed pretty well but really take a chunk out when you try to take them out. You have to be really careful and slowly glide them down towards the end of your hair and even then you might have a few casualties. It was a little better on my hair since its not as thick.</li>
    <li> Package was already opened upon arrival.  Some of gems missing - appears to have&lt;br /&gt;been a return - but sent out to fulfil my order.  Am very disappointed since&lt;br /&gt;this was on my grandaughters Christmas List.&lt;br /&gt;**Footnote to this purchase - owner of company emailed me and offered to send another Hair Jeweler. Package again opened about 3/4 but product intact - He sent at no charge b/c of initial problem.  Appreciate the good Customer Service from this vendor. Item a little difficult to use.**</li>
    <li> Exactly as described and other reviewers are correct about needing a small portion of hair in order for it to work properly. My daughter seemed to like it. Replacement jewels are expensive though.</li>
    <li> This was for my granddaughter and she gave it the 5 star rating for value and ease of use.  It was fun.</li>
    <li> Tends to pull hair when putting the gems in, which is not favorable for kids.  They liked it, but quickly lost interest in it because it was not as easy as you would think and would pull their hair too hard.</li>
    <li> Gave it to my grandchild. She liked it.</li>
    <li> Broke immediately.  Piece of junk.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!!!!!!!! Works wonderfully, came quickly. not much else to say!&lt;br /&gt;I hate how the prices almost doubled though! I bought it for around $9, and came back to buy another, but it was $15!!!</li>
    <li> great item for daughter to play with.  she loves it and that makes me like it more too.  great job.</li>
    <li> I got this for my niece, and I guess she really loved it. Worked well enough and served its purpose.</li>
    <li> My neice loves to be in the spotlight and all things glamorous and glitzy get her attention immediately. This was a Christmas gift for her.She had jeweled her hair with no help from her mom by New Year&#x27;s Day with no difficulty. It&#x27;s easy to use and any little glamor princess will love it.</li>
    <li> I remember having the Bead Blast Barbie set as a young girl. It&#x27;s pretty much the same idea but stringing the gems/beads onto the hair was far more complicated than using this. This is definitely faster and the gems really do stay in place. My daughter and I both love playing with it in each other&#x27;s hair, or her dolls&#x27;  hair. Sometimes we use it on our Shit Ze Mallows and it looks just as nice on her!!!</li>
    <li> Very simple to use, my 4 year old daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> works well and my daughter loves it</li>
    <li> Kids loved this for Christmas.  Great gift, easy to use.</li>
    <li> Does not work will not hold the jewels in the hair. I am very disatisfied with this product. thank  you</li>
