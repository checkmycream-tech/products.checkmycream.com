      <li>She has fine curly hair.</li>
      <li>I got lucky because I didn&#x27;t end up having to search endlessly for a perfect hair product for my son.</li>
      <li>The coconut in it is very hydrating and as my hair dries, the curls come out and look nice all day and night.</li>
      <li>It also has just a light coconut scent, and it&#x27;s not tested on animals.    </li>
      <li>Tried everything else and went back to this!  Smells wonderful and after leaving in 5 minutes makes combing through knots much easier.  </li>
      <li>The only thing I haven&#x27;t found is a good holding gel/pomade that will keep her curls from frizzing or shrinking in the south Florida humidity.</li>

      <li>This conditioner keeps my daughter&#x27;s curly hair nice and soft.</li>

      <li>Smells more like red velvet cake than coconut.</li>
      <li>thanks!</li>
      <li>We have been using Curly Q&#x27;s since our son had his first hair cut, and it continues to work quite well.</li>
      <li>We get stopped wherever we go because people want to \\&quot;sprong\\&quot; my daughter&#x27;s hair or compliment us on how gorgeous her curls are - and they certainly didn&#x27;t want to do that before we started using this product line - when her hair was frizzy and dried out.  </li>
      <li>We love this product and will be using it for a long time to come!</li>
      <li>Appearance of dry hair is 100% better.</li>
      <li>Amazing product for my daughters tight curls.</li>
      <li>His blond hair is fine and tangles easily, especially after naps and over night.</li>
      <li>and he&#x27;s ready to go.</li>
      <li>It did absolutely nothing but made our hair dry(er)...</li>
      <li>but I really didnt want to beleive it was faliing out).</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something to REALLY make the knots just slip away, I would recommend the weekly conditioner that comes with a box of Clairol Herbal Essence hair dye.</li>
      <li>Not so much the case now.</li>
      <li>but once the curly hair drys it becomes very frizzy and it does not elongate the curl...</li>
      <li>She has very curly hair</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy and seems to leave his hair nice and moisturized.</li>
      <li>Great for all hair types, including coarse, dry, damaged, and chemically treated kinky, medium or coarse curly hair.\\&quot;...  </li>
      <li>I have straight hair and it works for me, it does make my hair soft and very shiny</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>It defintley brings out the natural curl in my hair and moisturizes it very well.  </li>
      <li>I brought this product a few months ago because in the description it says \\&quot;Guaranteed to soften the kinkiest curl, moisturize the driest lock, and detangle the most unruly tresses.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product if you want your natural curls to come out.</li>
      <li>However, this product can be very helpful, especially for mothers like myself who does not really have any experience with this kind of hair (extremaly dry and curly).</li>
      <li>leaves my girls&#x27; hair silky and soft!</li>
      <li>They are so soft and hydrated.</li>
      <li>She is now 2 years old</li>
      <li>It washes out completely and leaves her hair so silky and bouncy.</li>
      <li>I wanted something natural for her.</li>
      <li>My Daughters hair is i would say 3b-3c and this product does bring moister but on the second day it becomes very frizzy and the hair is not defined at all.</li>
      <li>It makes her hair incredibly soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended for African hair.</li>
      <li>No matter how much of this conditioner I use out how long I leave it on</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells exactly like Butter Rum Lifesavers.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s sickeningly sweet and very thick</li>
      <li>I have a daughter of Ethiopian heritage and this conditioner goes on really heavy in the bath, so that it protects her hair and helps me loosen any knots, but it doesn&#x27;t weigh her precious curls down during the day.</li>
      <li>the products looked ok when the hair was wet, but as soon as it dried, the hair was dry, course, frizzy.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It did absolutely nothing for my curls, if anything it made them curl less</li>
      <li>I spray a little bit of this into his tangles and gently ease the knots out with my fingers</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This conditioner smells delicious. I hate using heavy, chemical smelling products on my kids&#x27; hair. However, this conditioner smells wonderful. I mix it with water and use it as a leave-in as well. My daughter&#x27;s hair looks great when I use this mixture to style her hair.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is great!!! I use it on my daughters hair and it makes her hair soft and manageable, leaving her with great shiny curls. It also has a wonderful scent.</li>
    <li> Just the best conditioner for curly hair, for any age! Instantly makes any damage invisible! Smells amazing. I love it!</li>
    <li> it smells so good and it works great!  leaves my girls&#x27; hair silky and soft!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It defintley brings out the natural curl in my hair and moisturizes it very well.  I would highly recommend this product if you want your natural curls to come out.</li>
    <li> I have a daughter of Ethiopian heritage and this conditioner goes on really heavy in the bath, so that it protects her hair and helps me loosen any knots, but it doesn&#x27;t weigh her precious curls down during the day. It also has just a light coconut scent, and it&#x27;s not tested on animals.    We apply it every time we get in the bath (we only wash hair once a week, though), let it stay on for a few minutes, then just barely rinse it off with maybe a cupful of water.     If you&#x27;re looking for something to REALLY make the knots just slip away, I would recommend the weekly conditioner that comes with a box of Clairol Herbal Essence hair dye. I know that sounds so random, but it&#x27;s a miracle for us.  I buy boxes of the hair dye just to get the conditioner out.</li>
    <li> I brought this product a few months ago because in the description it says \\&quot;Guaranteed to soften the kinkiest curl, moisturize the driest lock, and detangle the most unruly tresses. Great for all hair types, including coarse, dry, damaged, and chemically treated kinky, medium or coarse curly hair.\\&quot;...  I&#x27;m sorry, but I don&#x27;t know what type of black person this product was made for, but it certainly wasn&#x27;t made for me or my nieces. This stuff is so weak, it was as if I just put nothing but coconut water in my hair. It did absolutely nothing but made our hair dry(er)...Me and my nieces have different hair textures. My curls are a bit looser and my hair is very coarse and dry. My nieces curls are a lot tighter but their have is softer than mine (cottony). According to the claims it should have worked for at least one of us. The only thing I like about this product is the scent. They say it&#x27;s coconut, but to me it smells more like butterscotch. If you have SILKY curly hair, this product was probably made for you, but not for people with porous kinky hair unfortunately.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It is a must for \\&quot;mixed hair\\&quot;. Have been using it on my daughter curly hair and it smells great and leave her hair very moisturized. Unfortunately, the effect last only for few hours after washing the hair and because I always wash it in the evening she has a dry affro in the morning. However, this product can be very helpful, especially for mothers like myself who does not really have any experience with this kind of hair (extremaly dry and curly).</li>
    <li> I have researched for conditioners all over the internet and i thought by the reviews that this was it, boy was i WRONG!&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner does offer shine and softness to the hair but once the curly hair drys it becomes very frizzy and it does not elongate the curl... it makes it shorter than before. My Daughters hair is i would say 3b-3c and this product does bring moister but on the second day it becomes very frizzy and the hair is not defined at all. I would not be buying this product again. I have straight hair and it works for me, it does make my hair soft and very shiny but im afraid for long  curly hair, this is not the product.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner, it smells nice and keeps my sons curls in ringlets after using it at bath time and makes his hair very shiny too. I&#x27;ve also been using the Curly Q&#x27;s Moist Curls Detangler/daily Curl Moisturizer as well and I love that product too. I can use that when we&#x27;re on the go, even on dry hair. I got lucky because I didn&#x27;t end up having to search endlessly for a perfect hair product for my son. This was the first one I tried and it works fabulously. A lot of people may think this product would just be good for ethnic hair types but it&#x27;s for any type of curly hair. We love this product and will be using it for a long time to come!</li>
    <li> If I could give this product line zero stars I would. I am not sure which (or it could be all) of the curly q products made her hair fall out. I was using the detanger, the mimosa oil, the cleansin cutie shampoo and cocunut dream conditioner. None of them worked on her hair. She has fine curly hair. the products looked ok when the hair was wet, but as soon as it dried, the hair was dry, course, frizzy. And after about 4 months of using this products, her hair fell out (it started gradually but I really didnt want to beleive it was faliing out). Now my beautiful girl has no hair on the side or back of her head . She looks like the dude from kid and play.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as great as I hoped. My daughter is Caucasian with super curly and frizzy hair. No matter how much of this conditioner I use out how long I leave it on it doesn&#x27;t make a difference. Back to the drawing board...</li>
    <li> Amazing product for my daughters tight curls. They are so soft and hydrated. Appearance of dry hair is 100% better. Smells amazing too.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a 1-year old who is mixed with Hispanic and black. She has very curly hair and this is PERFECT for her. It allows you to easily detangle with your fingers or a wide-toothed comb. Her hair comes out nice, soft, and silky. She is now 2 years old and I came to purchase my second bottle. This bottle has surprisingly lasted a full year as Amazon indicates I purchased it in May of 2014. I was surprised because intially when I purchased it I thought it was too expensive, but since it lasted a year, it is well worth the price. Especially since it works. I also purchased their moisturizer. The only thing I haven&#x27;t found is a good holding gel/pomade that will keep her curls from frizzing or shrinking in the south Florida humidity.</li>
    <li> This made my hair very dull, it took away the shine on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It also made it fly-away and dry-feeling.&lt;br /&gt;It smells exactly like Butter Rum Lifesavers.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s sickeningly sweet and very thick like butter.&lt;br /&gt;It did absolutely nothing for my curls, if anything it made them curl less and I found my hair less manageable.&lt;br /&gt;No thanks!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my granddaughter&#x27;s very thick but length curly hair.  My daughter told me that it worked but she had to use a lot of the product.  I think it is a little costly.</li>
    <li> Smells really good. Feels a little thicker than I would have expected but works well.</li>
    <li> Love the scent &amp; does beautifully with my blonde curly headed 2.5 year old &amp; 4.5 year old girls hair.</li>
    <li> My 1 and a half year old girl has really rough 2c/3a hair, and this just smoothens and tangles it into dreamy waves. Love love it and I love the smell too. Oh and we are Indian.</li>
    <li> great for fine curls and great smell for little girl</li>
    <li> We use the Curly Q Coconut Dream Moisturizing Conditioner as a \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot;, and then we spray her with the Curly Qs Moist Curl DeTangler.  And in return, my four-year-old daughter has the most gorgeous platinum spiral curls down to the middle of her back - and she smells amazing.  All this out of two products.  She calls it her Princess shampoo and spray.    We get stopped wherever we go because people want to \\&quot;sprong\\&quot; my daughter&#x27;s hair or compliment us on how gorgeous her curls are - and they certainly didn&#x27;t want to do that before we started using this product line - when her hair was frizzy and dried out.  It&#x27;s hard to make blond hair moisturized - harder still to make it LOOK moist: shiny and glossy.  These products do both.</li>
    <li> Smells more like red velvet cake than coconut. Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s golden loose wavy curls can get a little dry with regular conditioners. I wanted something natural for her. I have previously used the Oidad curly kids and it was getting a little too thin for her hair as she has gotten older.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried this might be too heavy for her hair but it is awesome. It washes out completely and leaves her hair so silky and bouncy. No frizz or roughness. And her hair smells amazing! I feel like I&#x27;m on vacation when I sing her lullaby- and it&#x27;s a natural coconut scent, not cloying or fake smelling. Love this conditioner.</li>
    <li> My son is of African American and Irish descent. He has an incredible mass of thick, curly and unruly hair. Nothing short of half a bottle of conditioner will allow me to control it. And I&#x27;d still have to dedicate an hour to it. That is until I found this product. Curly Q was a God send! The first time I washed and conditioned his hair, it fell past his shoulders on it&#x27;s own. Before combing. Before brushing. That in it&#x27;s self was a miracle. On top of that the curls stayed shiny and beautiful for days! If your child has stubborn curls, you have arrived at the answer to your problems!</li>
    <li> We have been using Curly Q&#x27;s since our son had his first hair cut, and it continues to work quite well. Highly recommended for African hair.</li>
    <li> Overpriced and not detangling.</li>
    <li> Tried everything else and went back to this!  Smells wonderful and after leaving in 5 minutes makes combing through knots much easier.  Rinses away nicely.  I&#x27;ve been using it on my daughter for 5 years.</li>
    <li> This product is really wonderful for curly haired kids...really does a great job on my daughters hair</li>
    <li> I use this conditioner and it produces the best results! My hair is normally mostly curly with lots of frizz. Once I use this, the frizz is gone, and my curls lay nicely. The coconut in it is very hydrating and as my hair dries, the curls come out and look nice all day and night.</li>
    <li> This product works really great in my daughter&#x27;s hair and it smells so amazing!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best spray conditioners (leave in) that I&#x27;ve found for my son&#x27;s very curly hair. His blond hair is fine and tangles easily, especially after naps and over night. I spray a little bit of this into his tangles and gently ease the knots out with my fingers and he&#x27;s ready to go. It&#x27;s not too heavy and seems to leave his hair nice and moisturized. Smells nice too.</li>
    <li> Smells good and left my daughters hair really soft and easy to comb.</li>
    <li> My 2-year old&#x27;s curls are forming naturally and her hair is looking great. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Dry out my baby&#x27;s curls</li>
    <li> This conditioner keeps my daughter&#x27;s curly hair nice and soft. It makes her hair incredibly soft and manageable. Great for tight kinky curls!</li>
    <li> Used this product before when they produced the bigger bottle. Remember product being richer in consistency, making it truly scrumptious to use. Not so much the case now. Product seems lighter in consistancy and the size of the bottle has shrunk somewhat...interestingly the price hasn&#x27;t though!</li>
