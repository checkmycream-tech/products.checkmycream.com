### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This product is excellent.</li>
      <li>Happy birthday to me!</li>
      <li>Product is wonderful, however, expiration date is 2 months after delivery.</li>
      <li>Lamisil tablets are great too, but over time you can do damage to your kidneys or your liver with that I believe.  </li>
      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>I recommend this product to my clients that have toe nail fungus, works great.</li>
      <li>Great service great product</li>
      <li>Will update as it grows but am extremely happy.  </li>
      <li>I have about a quarter of an inch of healthy nail growing in!</li>
      <li>I thought this was going to be a nail fungus solution, and it is more of a athletes foot, and &amp;#34;moisture under the acrylics&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t write many reviews but for the many people that suffer from nail fungal infections, I want them to know there is a product that will help.  </li>
      <li>An ok product.  </li>
      <li>There are better products.</li>
      <li>You may have to go through more than one bottle to even begin to notice results, but you WILL if you stick with it.  </li>
      <li>I like this one better than the &amp;#34;herbal&amp;#34; products.</li>
      <li>am convinced that if your fungal-infected nail has been infected for many years, with nail-bed involvement, as some of mine have, THERE IS NO CURE out there at this time.  </li>
      <li>Like most, I have tried a lot of products, even paid $1,000 for laser treatment that did NOTHING.  </li>
      <li>I gave up for several years but ran across Barielle here at Amazon and remembered that their nail products are incredible, so I tried the fungus</li>
      <li>The calluses we easily peeled off.</li>
      <li>I have never met a Barielle product that I didn&#x27;t think was well worth the money.</li>
      <li>Did not clear up my toenail fungus after many months of use.</li>
      <li>This is inexpensive and works really well.  </li>
      <li>So Don&#x27;t know what to really say about this Product...</li>
      <li>Eliminated fungal infection of toe nail bed far more rapidly and completely than other products available on the market.</li>
      <li>This is significant, as I did not believe this was possible.  </li>
      <li>Better than other products I have tried.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I can watch the new nail growing out from the cuticle.</li>
      <li>However, Barielle Fungus Rx is the next best thing, because after using it for a while, I almost forget that I have this ugly, embarrassing disease.  </li>
      <li>Product may be good for athletes foot fungus but useless for nail fungus.</li>
      <li>I am so excited to update my review to report that a badly infected nail with major nail bed damage is growing a new, HEALTHY nail.</li>
      <li>I used this religiously - as directed - for over a month on my big toenail, and found absolutely zero improvement.  </li>
      <li>Not nearly long enough to deal with fungal problems.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It seemed to help some but it was a long time and I have gone the doctors route.</li>
    <li> my toe nails are getting thick and I was developing patches of callus-like skin on my heels and next to my big toe and the skin between my toes was corrording--sorry for the graphic description but this is to say that after two application there was a vast improvement. The calluses we easily peeled off. If I keep at it for a few months I toenail regrowth might approach normal? I ordered another tube.</li>
    <li> An ok product.  May or may not work for U. Prompt response from vendor.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband.  We are amazed that we are already seeing results after only two weeks of use.  I would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> This type of product takes a LONG time to work. You may have to go through more than one bottle to even begin to notice results, but you WILL if you stick with it.  I like this one better than the &amp;#34;herbal&amp;#34; products.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Eliminated fungal infection of toe nail bed far more rapidly and completely than other products available on the market.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent. Highly recommended. I have never met a Barielle product that I didn&#x27;t think was well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I thought this was going to be a nail fungus solution, and it is more of a athletes foot, and &amp;#34;moisture under the acrylics&amp;#34; fungus solution. I actually used it on my son, and one dose was all it took. I couldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was listed under the toenail/fingernail fungus remedy category here on Amazon. When it arrived and I read the directions it said it was not intended for and does not work on nails. My problem was with the nail so I can&#x27;t say if this product works for it&#x27;s intended purpose .</li>
    <li> Great service great product</li>
    <li> Product may be good for athletes foot fungus but useless for nail fungus. There are better products.</li>
    <li> Product is wonderful, however, expiration date is 2 months after delivery. Not nearly long enough to deal with fungal problems.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews but for the many people that suffer from nail fungal infections, I want them to know there is a product that will help.  Like most, I have tried a lot of products, even paid $1,000 for laser treatment that did NOTHING.  I used a prescription topical product for a year, also with no improvement.  I gave up for several years but ran across Barielle here at Amazon and remembered that their nail products are incredible, so I tried the fungus Rx last summer.  After using it for about 9 months, it has cured 3 lesser-infected nails and improved the appearance of the other nails (bad nail-bed infection) 300%.  The skin around the nails has smoothed out and the nails themselves have smoothed and improved to the point that I can apply nail polish and \\&quot;hide\\&quot; the infection (I have infection of both feet and fingernails.)  I use this product as directed, am on my third bottle, and will purchase this product as long as they keep making it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am convinced that if your fungal-infected nail has been infected for many years, with nail-bed involvement, as some of mine have, THERE IS NO CURE out there at this time.  However, Barielle Fungus Rx is the next best thing, because after using it for a while, I almost forget that I have this ugly, embarrassing disease.  Use it faithfully as directed, you will see improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:. I am so excited to update my review to report that a badly infected nail with major nail bed damage is growing a new, HEALTHY nail. It can only be due to my continued use of this product. This is significant, as I did not believe this was possible.  I have about a quarter of an inch of healthy nail growing in! Will update as it grows but am extremely happy.  Happy birthday to me!</li>
    <li> I recommend this product to my clients that have toe nail fungus, works great.</li>
    <li> Been struggling with toe nail fungus for about 6 years.  This product helps.  Can&#x27;t say it cures the problem but it does allow me to wear sandals in the summer.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Totally works.  Lamisil tablets are great too, but over time you can do damage to your kidneys or your liver with that I believe.  This is inexpensive and works really well.  It has totally kept any nail fungus at bay for me.</li>
    <li> Does not work. According to description,  this is for nails. However it&#x27;s stated on packaging that it is not for nails.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Husband and he has been using it everyday. But not seeing any change he said. So Don&#x27;t know what to really say about this Product...</li>
    <li> I used this religiously - as directed - for over a month on my big toenail, and found absolutely zero improvement.  I hate to give a negative review, but I can&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It works.  I can watch the new nail growing out from the cuticle. Better than other products I have tried.</li>
    <li> Did not clear up my toenail fungus after many months of use.</li>
    <li> Number one fugal solution. Will try no other, I use to loose my big toes nail every winter  since I have been using this I kept my nails two years in a row.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot.  It may take another month or so of use to see the final results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ony been using this lotion for a week and already I see a difference. Other products I have tried were a failure.</li>
