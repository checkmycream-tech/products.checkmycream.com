      <li>Love this stuff...</li>
      <li>I chose this product because of all the healthy ingredients listed.</li>
      <li>so maybe it will take more like 10-12 weeks to see improvement.  </li>
      <li>I had hoped for better results.</li>
      <li>Love love Eminence Products.</li>
      <li>could have done a better job for the money.  </li>
      <li>Love Eminence, though this won&#x27;t be the eye serum for me.</li>

      <li>My eyes look much more refreshed and the skin looks firmer and softer.</li>
      <li>I am really enjoying this cream.  </li>
      <li>Priced better than you find in salons.&lt;br /&gt;Product performs as advertised.</li>
      <li>I have started to use this serum and really love it.  </li>
      <li>Eye shadow also stays better when using this product before make-up.  </li>
      <li>This eye cream has all the lifting effects and line smoothing effects of retinol, I think better, with better results and no reactions.</li>
      <li>I used Lancome for  years and was completely satisfied with my skin using  their products.</li>
      <li>though I might try another product from MyChelle when I finish this bottle and see for myself which works better.</li>
      <li>I love this serum.  </li>
      <li>This product is perfect for daily use as it keeps the skin around the eye area and lids hydrated but not greasy.</li>
      <li>I had been using Eminence for more than 7 years now, and I like their products.</li>
      <li>Boo because I love this product line.</li>
      <li>Very light and easy to apply, not greasy.  </li>
      <li>Age 63 and helps evens ur face color and has SPF which is great since I live in FL</li>
      <li>Keeps the fine lines from becoming more than that.</li>
      <li>:) my skin around eyes looks better and I notice that my wrikles are much smoother !!</li>
      <li>It does not burn eye area and has a very mild fragrance.  </li>
      <li>noticed some fine lines returning when I switched to this product.</li>
      <li>It tightens and reduces the appearance of fine and expression lines when applied.  </li>
      <li>It seems that apple stem cells (one of the main ingredietns of this product) are working because my esthetician says that I barely have any under eye lines (which makes me very happy).  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and the results are great!</li>
      <li>The cream is light, yet creamy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a light consistence so you can use all the time.</li>
      <li>It applies smoothly</li>
      <li>It has an interesting and earthy smell, but well worth it in its effects.</li>
      <li>It took about a month for my skin to adjust to the new regime but I am more than satisfied with all of the Eminence products.</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly and helps with fine lines.</li>
      <li>That said, this serum has significantly softened the crepeing that&#x27;s beginning to creep in under my eyelids to the point that it&#x27;s almost gone.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Goes on nice and smells good, but it&#x27;s not going to replace my Replenix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed some fine lines returning when I switched to this product. I think I&#x27;m going to combine it with my other eye cream from now on. I still have yet to find a good organic product that truly reduces lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update my review if my feelings change.</li>
    <li> It was great for puffy eyes but my fine lines are still there. not happy with that for the price should have gave me a lift for the price.</li>
    <li> If you want to go organic on your skin, then the Eminence line is what you want. I used Lancome for  years and was completely satisfied with my skin using  their products. A few years ago I realized how many chemicals are in skin products that have very nasty side affects with long term use and decided to go organic. It took about a month for my skin to adjust to the new regime but I am more than satisfied with all of the Eminence products. Would highly recommend them to anyone who wants to stop polluting their bodies with chemicals.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;m in my early 30s and have started developing fine lines around my eyes. I noticed improvement in the appearance after only a couple days. You only need to use a tiny amount; one small pump is plenty for the skin around my eyes. It absorbs really quickly so it&#x27;s perfect for under a moisturizer. I put this on each night and morning and lasts the entire time. One thing I will mention is that the packaging was pretty banged up when I received it, but the extra space inside the product box kept the bottle from getting damaged.</li>
    <li> I had hoped for better results.</li>
    <li> Almost immediate soothing response. I&#x27;ve thrown away or discontinued usage of almost all my eye products. I&#x27;ve always used quality prepatory eye treatments of various kinds, high end, organic, you name it. This Neroli age creamy product gave me an instant soothing response. The I followed up with some eye concealer and it applied very well. My eye area is soft, supple &amp; nourished feeling. The skin around the eye doesn&#x27;t look taught, irritated or wrinkled as I was experiencing beforehand. This had such good results, I know the ingredients are the trick. Eminence believes in quality &amp; so do I.</li>
    <li> Hands down my favorite eye cream! I can use this at night time or in the morning before makeup application and it absorbs beautifully into the skin and creates a perfectly smooth base for undereye concealer. I have seen a noticeable difference in fine lines and uneven texture around my eyes with this stuff.</li>
    <li> Love this eye serum!  It won&#x27;t perform miracles, of course, but it does help to firm up undereye skin a bit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product from a local spa for years but for $20 more than the price I paid on Amazon. The product is awesome! I get the same results as I would with an eye cream containing retinol but without my skin getting dry. I&#x27;m 39, and people regularly think I&#x27;m in my late 20s/early 30s; I think this eye serum plays a big part in that. I started using it on my 39-year-old boyfriend who used to smoke like a chimney and has never used sunscreen. I can already see a difference in his crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t live life without it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using eminence products for 2 years now and this is another quality product from them.  It smells good and keeps my eyes hydrated.  I use it throughout the day for extra hydration.</li>
    <li> Very gentle and moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Love this eye cream!! This my second time purchasing it! It last a long time....I got my first one in December last year!</li>
    <li> Received the wrong product&lt;br /&gt;Never tried it</li>
    <li> This is okay, but did not really do anything to help my puffy eyes or discoloration.  I will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is the second time that I purchase, I like this product. the skin under my eyes start to get lose and after one minute that you apply this cream you start to feel your skin a little firmer. It&#x27;s a light consistence so you can use all the time.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. You only need a little bit and it lasts a long time. Not greasy, but super moisturizing. I was starting to get crows feet and this helped diminish them I use eminence vitamin c serum before applying this and together, they make my skin look super fresh and line free</li>
    <li> I was introduced to Eminence skin care line almost two years ago.  My personal preference is their Probiotic Moisture cream but I have been trying their other products as well (they keep coming with new formulas).  Before using Neroli Age Corrective Eye cream I also used their Lavander Eye cream.  What arrtacted me to Neroli is that this particular line is meant to be age defining line.  It seems that apple stem cells (one of the main ingredietns of this product) are working because my esthetician says that I barely have any under eye lines (which makes me very happy).  Crow feet lines are non-existent.  It took me a while to get used to exotic scent of Neroli which is type of oil used in India.  My personal preference is Lavender scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this eye cream in the morning and at night.  It gets absorbed quickly, but like other Eminence products is has protective film which one can feel when washing face.  This protective film stays over night - even pillow does not take it off - and throughout the entire day).  I am totaly devoted to this skin care line.  My next product I will try from this line is Monoi Age Corrective Night Cream for Face and Neck and Neroli Mist (spritzing toner).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you never used this line before you must try it.  It will not disappoint you at all.</li>
    <li> First eye product I&#x27;ve used that isn&#x27;t oily.  Priced better than you find in salons.&lt;br /&gt;Product performs as advertised. Will order again</li>
    <li> I have started to use this serum and really love it.  i have used it twice and already seeing a difference.</li>
    <li> Great.  Can see a difference.  I have reordered it.</li>
    <li> I use this along with MyChelle G2 Instant Firming Serum and a couple of other items from MyChelle and the huge bags under my eyes have considerably gotten less.  I recommend it... though I might try another product from MyChelle when I finish this bottle and see for myself which works better. A bit, to say the least, expensive.. but what are ya going to do? Get surgery? hum... next best thing and organic which I believe in only using since there are so many toxins in the beauty industry - they are not regulated by the government.  Then again are we all watching and seeing what these huge corporations are getting away with in the food industry?!!!  I can not stress the importance of buying organic.  I believe there are over 100 ingredients that are used in the United States that are just not allowed in hundreds of countries! HELLO!!!</li>
    <li> I was first given this product at a fancy spa in a facial.  I purchased it and found that it reduced the wrinkles on my eye lids so it is easier to applyt eye liner.</li>
    <li> I was looking for good eye serum or cream.&lt;br /&gt;I read so many positive reviews on this, that&#x27;s why I bought.  Yes, this became one of my favorite too !</li>
    <li> Love love Eminence Products. Have been using now about  year. Age 63 and helps evens ur face color and has SPF which is great since I live in FL</li>
    <li> Love Eminence, though this won&#x27;t be the eye serum for me. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference, so I&#x27;ll be trying another flavor.</li>
    <li> Great eye treatment.  As time goes on I&#x27;m not getting anymore wrinkles and everyone compliments my eyes and I&#x27;m a senior.  Love this product line.</li>
    <li> Great product !! I&#x27;m so happy I ordered it :) my skin around eyes looks better and I notice that my wrikles are much smoother !!</li>
    <li> A 5 star rating was chosen because I like the product.  It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.  After a few days I could see a difference. Only a small amount is used which means the bottle will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this time, I can&#x27;t think of any cons.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for maybe a month now and I&#x27;m not sure what its really doing.  It&#x27;s not bad or anything.  I use it everyday and night.  Maybe its me, maybe I am hoping for something more dramatic.  I have bought several eye products and so far the only one I really likes was from the perricone line.  I will use it till its gone but then after I might try something else.  It does not burn eye area and has a very mild fragrance.  When it arrive some of it has escaped the bottle and was on the packaging.  Maybe from a pressure change?  Not sure.</li>
    <li> Love this company &amp; this product! C.</li>
    <li> I have thin fine lines, I read the reviews before buying this serum and there were very good reviews about the results. I had been using Eminence for more than 7 years now, and I like their products. With this serum I have not noticed any difference on using it, it been only 2 months, hope to see difference with time.</li>
    <li> Love all eminence products. I have an especially sensitive eye area. This product works well.</li>
    <li> The cream is light, yet creamy. It&#x27;s soothing. The scent of neroli is light and wonderful. Best eye cream I&#x27;ve used!</li>
    <li> Keeps the fine lines from becoming more than that.</li>
    <li> I mix it in with my Wild Plum moisturizer. I have not really seen any noticeable difference in the dark circles, which is why I originally purchased this product. However, I will use it to the end - because It just feels nice to use as an extra eye moisture cream.</li>
    <li> I use this with the Eminence Herbal Eye Contour Cream. My eyes look much more refreshed and the skin looks firmer and softer. I really like it, just wish it smelled nice like the other Eminence products I use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, found it!  This not only firms, but also depuffs, and helps with circles.  So nice to find something that doesn&#x27;t break out my eyes in either those irritating little bumps, or painful styes.  Shouldn&#x27;t because it&#x27;s all natural and handmade.  I was recently told I had too much estrogen in my system, and it&#x27;s because I started getting caught up in the hype of everything firming and working miracles.  I went back to natural and organic and my estrogen has gone down.  Be careful some of these cosmetic and skin care stuff has very many harmful ingredients for you.</li>
    <li> Age happens, but this serum is helpful for the effects.</li>
    <li> This is one of those rare products that actually works!  I use this morning and night.  It has an exotic smell, a lovely texture and is organic.  A must have in my beauty routine.  Sometimes I put a heavier eye cream on top of it at night for an extra wow effect.</li>
    <li> My skin loves this!  I have dry/oily combination skin that I never realized needed additional moisturizing until I tried this. It has an interesting and earthy smell, but well worth it in its effects.</li>
    <li> i have used Eminence for 4 months now. I recently added this one to my products. Have not used it long enough to describe any effect, but I feel like it is doing something. I used another of their serums and didn&#x27;t think it did anything, until about 3 months had passed, then suddenly i realized all my redness was gone. So i am being patient and will continue using this as i did the other one, and will come back and update after a couple of months</li>
    <li> Great price, compared to the store I usually purchase Eminence products.</li>
    <li> LOVE! I will be using this for the rest of my life!! It tightens and protects my tender under eye skin! (I&#x27;m 38 with out a wrinkle. Don&#x27;t hate me, I&#x27;m an Eminence lover!) I use a tiny bit of this and gently PAT it into my skin with a cold ring finger after washing my face (use luke warm, almost cold water to wash your face people!) and then after this is absorbed (think brush teeth time, or go get dressed) I dab (pat pat pat) a tiny tiny bit of the Wild Plum eye cream on and I am good to go all day!!! Looks great under make up when I wear it, but I don&#x27;t feel like I need make up after more than a year of being converted to Eminence!! I use the Sweet Red Rose Cleaner, the Monoi Age scrub wash stuff every other day, the two eye creams I mentioned, the sweet red rose toner, the cuporose C serum (at night) , sweet red rose moisturizer (at night), Carrot and Vitamin masque (great for evening skin tone!!) a few times a week (you can sleep in it!! just  apply it with water to make a thin cream), and I&#x27;m trying out the red currant moisturizer with SPF during the day.  I like it alone- not so much with make up.  I have oily/combination HYPER sensitive skin, just a fyi.</li>
    <li> You can actually feel the serum working. This is the best eye cream that I have ever used. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my late 60s and have no intention of looking 22 again.  That said, this serum has significantly softened the crepeing that&#x27;s beginning to creep in under my eyelids to the point that it&#x27;s almost gone.  The serum is made from all organic ingredients so it&#x27;s clean and pure.  I especially love that it&#x27;s never tested on animals.  With consistent use, this serum brings incredible results -- at least it has for me,</li>
    <li> I love Eminence products, but have not been overly impressed by this item. I would not purchase it again. The smell is awful and I do not notice much difference in my eye area. I think coconut oil does a better job and is much cheaper, more natural.</li>
    <li> I love this serum.  It is not greasy feeling, very moisturizing and doesnt burn my eyes!&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> it makes the skin around my eyes break out, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to help much with the crows feet. Boo because I love this product line. It does smell wonderful.</li>
    <li> I received a facial in Hawaii at the Hyatt and was introduced[[ASIN:B007S649QU Eminence Organics Neroli Age Corrective Eye Serum 1 oz]] to this line of procucts. I waited until I got home and researched them and found a lot of positve feedback. I ordered the eye serum along with many of the other face produts. I really love all of them! I can definately see a change in my face - it looks dewy and soft. I also bought the Clarisonic to use with them and I believe that also helps. I would definately recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have used it for 3 weeks and ... .can see resuts already</li>
    <li> Delightful neroli scent. It feels fresh and tightening around the eye.</li>
    <li> Love this line! Natural, organic!</li>
    <li> I have used and do no notice a difference.</li>
    <li> Love how it keeps the skin under eyes youthful</li>
    <li> Wife loves it and will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Nothing like how it was advertised. A complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> It seems to be really working and has reduced the under-eye sagginess and fine lines in the corners.  Just a word of caution: It is an oily substance and requires time to seep into the skin.  Something to keep in mind if your morning routine is rushed.</li>
    <li> Cant get enough of this product! Combined with the Monoli and coconut creams, my face has never felt better!</li>
    <li> Feels good, am expecting no miracles...jury is still out...have used for 2 weeks now.</li>
    <li> Love! Love! Love this eye cream! A little goes a long way. I only use half a pump so I know this will last me for 6-8 months. I&#x27;ve been using Eminence for 3 years and their products work. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff...whole line is Amazing!!</li>
    <li> I am 55 and no one would believe it. I tried many eye creams, and never could use retinol, my eyes peeled and looked worse than before. This eye cream has all the lifting effects and line smoothing effects of retinol, I think better, with better results and no reactions. I also put what is left on my finger around my lips; I have no lip lines. A VERY LITTLE goes a long way, thin, spreads easily, don&#x27;t use much.</li>
    <li> I chose this product because of all the healthy ingredients listed. I was a little skeptical of the Retinol alternative, but I figured why not give it a try? I have to say, it really hasn&#x27;t done much for my eye area so far at all. I&#x27;m a little bit disappointed, but at the same time I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks. Maybe it just takes a longer to kick in?</li>
    <li> Wonderful eye serum.  Feels great on the eyes.</li>
    <li> Love this product!! Really does help w your crows feet and eye skin brightness! Would definitely recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I first this purchased at my local spa.  It is cheaper through Amazon.  You can also use it with good results on other problem areas of your face.</li>
    <li> I just started using this eye care product but so far I&#x27;m liking the results. It is very light and I do notice a slight plumping around my eyes. Great product</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t recommend this product and this skin care line enough.  You only thought you knew what good eye serum was until you try this one.  Use a very little bit and it goes a long way to tightening, lightening and enriching your eye area without being greasy, smelly or demanding to use.  Love your eyes?  Then, try Eminence Organics Neroli Age Corrective Eye Serum.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice serum in a little pump bottle, which keeps the product totally clean.  It applies smoothly and I love the fact that it&#x27;s natural.  The high price &amp;#34;department store brands&amp;#34; have harsh chemicals with a high price.  This beats any of them in every way.</li>
    <li> So soothing and nice.</li>
    <li> ...but this eye serum is a disappointment.  I use it morning and night but just cannot see any change at all.  I have been using it close to 4 weeks so maybe it will take more like 10-12 weeks to see improvement.  It was pricey and I felt like a drugstore eye serum could have done a better job for the money.  The other Eminence products I have are amazing so those I will continue to use but wouldn&#x27;t be repurchasing this serum :(</li>
    <li> I like the smoothness of my skin after using the Serum and the results so far are great!  Thank you! Thank You!</li>
    <li> SO HAPPY!!! This eye serum makes the eye area look so smooth and bright! I use it with a Vitamin C eye gel, it&#x27;s a one-two punch! I read about it in a magazine with rave reviews and decided I had to see for myself. Love!</li>
    <li> I use this on my eyes which are very sensitive. I have a patch of dry skin on one eyebrow and this is the only product that keeps it smooth and soft during the winter months.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried anything by Eminence Organics that I haven&#x27;t liked. This eye cream is incredibly moisturizing and smells great.  It lasts along time as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve great results with this serum. My fine lines around my eyes have essentially vanished! The pricing on here is great as well. I&#x27;ll definitely be trying out some other products from Eminence.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and the results are great! I love that it&#x27;s all organic.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for about a year and really like it.  It absorbs quickly and helps with fine lines.</li>
    <li> I recently went to a get a facial and the lady recommend this serum.  I like the fact that the ingredients are all natural.</li>
    <li> Overall I like this eye serum.  It tightens and reduces the appearance of fine and expression lines when applied.  I&#x27;m 35 and have pretty minimal fine lines and wrinkles (just the start of them), but I&#x27;ve been using this for just over a month and I have seen improvement in the depth of expression lines. I find this product tightens when used. It&#x27;s great to wear under makeup so makeup doesn&#x27;t settle in lines and creases and it eliminates puffiness.  Eye shadow also stays better when using this product before make-up.  This is my first eye care product and so far it&#x27;s improving the look and condition of skin around my eyes, but for something stronger and more systemic (to get to help reverse lines/wrinkles), I might try the Lavendar Age Corrective Night cream.  This product is perfect for daily use as it keeps the skin around the eye area and lids hydrated but not greasy.</li>
    <li> I used this product for 2 months, and ended up not using the whole bottle. After two months my wrinkles around my eyes became deeper, I got more of them now and the texture of my skin become worse. The only thing this product did for me was make me look older.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by a dermatologist.  It is very soothing to the eye and does appear to reduce lines and wrinkles.  I have been using it for about 4 weeks.  Product was new and sealed and delivered earlier than noted on the order.</li>
    <li> ... that you actually can feel working.  The fragrance isn&#x27;t over powering; actually has a nice earthy sent.  Have been utilizing for nine (9) days now and very pleased.  When applying to the eye area (following cleansing with ARCONA Raspberry Clarifying Bar [[ASIN:B000Z63V96 ARCONA Raspberry Clarifying Bar 4oz]]), the skin immediately starts to feel tight.  The best part is, the amount needed is so minimal; smaller than the size of a pea (I barely have to push down on the pump).  Looking forward to the continual usage results.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brand of products for a few months now and so far I really love Eminence. The cost on Amazon is much lower than at the salon.</li>
    <li> Refreshing for the eyes!</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying this cream.  Very light and easy to apply, not greasy.  Penetrates the skin quickly.  Crows feet seem to be not as deep.  I has been a week only.  I would recommend this cream and will definitely buy it again without hesitation. Good retinol alternative. If this does the same job, I am going for this one.</li>
    <li> An expensive product but I love Eminence Organics and this is no exception -- it rocks! I have been using an Obagi eye gel and I must admit this product is by far the better product.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed much with this product. Haven&#x27;t had for too long so maybe I need to use for longer period of time. I recommend the firm skin acai serum booster before this one.</li>
    <li> Makes your eyes feel like you just got a facial..  I will definitely buy it again and again.  Totally impressed!</li>
    <li> Eminence makes great skin products and I am never disappointed.  This corrective eye serum really&lt;br /&gt;keeps my under eyes moist and I can really see a small difference in my skin texture.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
