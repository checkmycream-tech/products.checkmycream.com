      <li>I usually love L&#x27;Oreal products, but this one, nope!</li>
      <li>Rather spread it thoroughly through each lock from bottom to top (not the roots!)    </li>
      <li>I would think that it should cost more!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s incredibly hydrating, smells great, leaves hair soft and manageable....</li>
      <li>it will lose it&#x27;s amazing effect on my hair</li>
      <li>I do have to switch it out every month or so to ensure that it stays effective.</li>

      <li>I use this hair product every week and my hair looks shiny, easy to manage and healthy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve dyed my hair every shade of the rainbow..and it always keeps it healthy and strong.</li>
      <li>This is a great conditioner that leaves my hair feeling soft.  </li>
      <li>Huge jar.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;After years of switching between conditioners and happily finding some suitable for my semi-thick medium straight hair this is the only one that stuck for the longest time.</li>
      <li>Great conditioner for dry curly hair!</li>
      <li>After trying many other products this one  gave good results.</li>
      <li>.Doesnt give much shine to hair but repairs frizz and dryness for sure.</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m pretty cheap and stick to drugstore prices).</li>
      <li>it really works.we have been using this long time.we are still happy with result.</li>
      <li>In winter, I need to use it more frequently, but in summer, it is a once a week</li>
      <li>but so worth it when your hair needs all the hydration it can</li>
      <li>Worth trying.</li>
      <li>My hair is sooooo soft and so clean, that when I use a straight iron, my hair looks extremely healthy and shiny.</li>
      <li>and it makes my hair so soft and smooth, so worth it</li>
      <li>Great one although not the same as it use to be, item is not the same as pictured, they have couple versions of the same product and the one pictured works slightly better.</li>
      <li>throw every other conditioner in the garbage - you wont find better than this!</li>
      <li>I tried many different inexpensive conditioners and achieved unsatisfactory results and that&#x27;s when I decided to give this one</li>
      <li>Found it at a better price at a local beauty store though</li>
      <li>This product is fantastic if you have colored hair and want your hair to look shiny and soft.</li>
      <li>I use different shampoos, one for dry hair, one that is Paul Mitchell, and Suave Tropical Coconut Shampoo (which I buy at the dollar store).. and this conditioner still manages to make my hair smell so great.</li>
      <li>Fast forward 3 months</li>
      <li>This is my fav conditioner, i have very curly hair</li>
      <li>the combo really works for my hair.</li>
      <li>It smells straight up like apples.</li>
      <li>It works very well to my hair.</li>
      <li>you put too much on</li>
      <li>this deep conditioner smells so amazing and makes even my dry brittle hair feel super soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s normal state!</li>
      <li>and my hair is touchably soft, super shiny, and generally straight (as is it&#x27;s natural</li>
      <li>Next month or the month after I will switch back to this baby :)</li>
      <li>works better than any other deep conditioner....</li>
      <li>it will definitely benefit you .Fragnance is ok unlike other hair masks and L&#x27;oreal products</li>
      <li>You can get in the shower without brushing your hair and it will get all the tangles undone and it leaves your hair so shiny and soft.</li>
      <li>I also recommend it for any type of hair natural or relaxed etc</li>
      <li>/&gt;With time and gentle care your hair can spring back to life with this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Manageable, shiny, and decently soft.</li>
      <li>When you use it, you will realize the potential of softness your hair is actually capable of not matter what shampoo you use.</li>
      <li>The tub is large so it lasts forever, even for someone like me who has long hair.  </li>
      <li>This works real well especially on dry brittle hair.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend, especially if you dye your hair or have hair that&#x27;s dry and damaged.</li>
      <li>i only wish they sold it in more places because i have only found it on amazon or at a very small local privately owned beauty supply store.</li>
      <li>The first time I tried this conditioner was about 5 years ago, the only reason why I stopped using it was because it became a little pricy for me</li>
      <li>The only mask works for dry ends, makes them soft and shiny!</li>

<li> Try to wash every other day, it will let your natural oils build up and allow your hair to   heal.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this conditioner and have been using it religiously for the past year and for how good it works</li>
<li> I swear after one use my hair was instantly dowsed in moisture and the softest it&#x27;s been in so long.</li>
<li> It keeps my oh-so-color-treated hair soft and supple without weighing it down.  </li>
<li> i have dry, bleach blonde hair, also with keratin treatment, and heat styling 2-3x a week.</li>
<li> The reason why I went back to it is because I bleached my hair from dark black to near white multiple times!</li>
<li> Try to wash every other day, it will let your natural oils build up and allow your hair to&lt;br /&gt;heal.your hair  in half or quarters and working your way from the front to the back of each section.</li>
<li> I have long heat styled and highlighted hair.  </li>
<li> but effect is long</li>
<li> This technique prevents dry spells-</li>
<li> It gave smoothness to my dry hair.</li>
<li> A final though.. a little goes a long way with this product.</li>
<li> so I recommend parting your hair  in half or quarters and working your way from the front to the back of each section.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s an everyday conditioner as well a deep conditioner if you want to leave it on for 30 minutes.  </li>
<li> But after using it for months - it can be heavy on fine hair and cause it to look limp and dowdy.</li>
<li> *Rinse with cold water for super shiny hair (seals the cuticles)    </li>
<li> My hair was breaking, falling out and as dry as dead grass.</li>
<li> with cold water for super shiny hair (seals the cuticles)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Do</li>
<li> The air is so dry in Colorado that an ordinary conditioner is just not sufficient.  </li>
<li> if it&#x27;s a little murky</li>
<li> A little makes all the difference so don&#x27;t slather it on like butter.</li>
<li> A little makes all the difference so don&#x27;t slather it on like butter.</li>

<li> wash your hair everyday!</li>
<li> *Don&#x27;t wash your hair everyday!</li>
<li> I was desperate to find a deep conditioner that worked and repaired.</li>
<li> /&gt;I was desperate after coloring my hair silly and walked into Sally&#x27;s with my hair in a nest.</li>
<li> When I finished the previous jar and changed to another conditioner my hair was awful</li>
<li> Highly obsessed!</li>
<li> i have cycled through every conditiner from very expensive to drugstore brand, everything on the market.</li>
<li> A bit boring after a while</li>
<li> I am very disappointed!</li>

    <li> This product is amaaaaaazzzzzing. Been using it for years. I&#x27;ve dyed my hair every shade of the rainbow..and it always keeps it healthy and strong. Highly recommend, especially if you dye your hair or have hair that&#x27;s dry and damaged. Love it!!</li>
    <li> works better than any other deep conditioner....my hairdresser uses it too! But after using it for months - it can be heavy on fine hair and cause it to look limp and dowdy.</li>
    <li> This stuff was recommended to me by my hair stylist.  It&#x27;s incredibly hydrating, smells great, leaves hair soft and manageable.... I recommend it!</li>
    <li> EDIT: FEB 11 2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So even though I love this conditioner and it&#x27;s a staple in my beauty cabinet I do have to switch it out every month or so to ensure that it stays effective. I&#x27;ve noticed if I don&#x27;t switch it out then it will lose it&#x27;s amazing effect on my hair so I recommend to have 2 favorites to alternate between. I use Hydralicious Berry Crush and add avocado oil to it- the combo really works for my hair. Next month or the month after I will switch back to this baby :) This technique prevents dry spells- and I also recommend you do this with your shampoo. Just two though! or you may lose track of what works for your hair and what doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;______________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of switching between conditioners and happily finding some suitable for my semi-thick medium straight hair this is the only one that stuck for the longest time. Biolage hydration mask has helped but stops helping after about 2-3 weeks of solid use. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 months and have not had to switch (until recently).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was desperate after coloring my hair silly and walked into Sally&#x27;s with my hair in a nest. After reading the reviews on this I figured why not and took the $10 plunge (it was on sale)&lt;br /&gt;After about 3 different washes my hair was back to it&#x27;s normal state! Manageable, shiny, and decently soft. Fast forward 3 months and my hair is touchably soft, super shiny, and generally straight (as is it&#x27;s natural state).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mind you I have stopped using heat about 2 years ago, and I only color my hair once every 3-4mo now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With time and gentle care your hair can spring back to life with this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a creamy texture, and you can tell it has oil in it because if you let it rest for a while a tiny bit of oil separation is visible. It smells straight up like apples. A bit boring after a while but so worth it when your hair needs all the hydration it can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you put too much on you&#x27;re likely to end up with greasy hair so I recommend parting your hair  in half or quarters and working your way from the front to the back of each section. A little makes all the difference so don&#x27;t slather it on like butter. Rather spread it thoroughly through each lock from bottom to top (not the roots!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: This is one of only 2 conditioners for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;*Rinse with cold water for super shiny hair (seals the cuticles)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Do NOT rinse until your hair is squeaky! Rinse until your hair is slippery but not slimy&lt;br /&gt;(you can check this by squeezing some water out of your hair into your palm- if it&#x27;s a little murky then you&#x27;re done!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Don&#x27;t wash your hair everyday!

    <li> Very good detangler and moisturizer for hair. Just wanted the made in USA version and this one is made in Canada.</li>
    <li> it is an excellent product</li>
    <li> This hair conditioner does wonders for my hair.  When I finished the previous jar and changed to another conditioner my hair was awful</li>
    <li> I have long heat styled and highlighted hair.  This is a great conditioner that leaves my hair feeling soft.

    <li> Huge jar.  If you&#x27;re into quantity rather than quality.  Did not work well for me at all.  Ended up throwing away.  I usually love L&#x27;Oreal products, but this one, nope!</li>
    <li> I think the product is great.  I have think hair and needed something to soften it up. This I your product!</li>
    <li> This is my fav conditioner, i have very curly hair and it makes my hair so soft and smooth, so worth it</li>
    <li> I have been using it for years! The only mask works for dry ends, makes them soft and shiny!</li>

I was desperate to find a deep conditioner that worked and repaired.

You can get in the shower without brushing your hair and it will get all the tangles undone and it leaves your hair so shiny and soft. I&#x27;m obsessed with this conditioner and have been using it religiously for the past year and for how good it works I would think that it should cost more!</li>
    <li> It works very well to my hair. Even though the item which I got has different looks. But it still works.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using this deep conditioner for years and years.  It keeps my oh-so-color-treated hair soft and supple without weighing it down.  In winter, I need to use it more frequently, but in summer, it is a once a week or once every two weeks treatment.</li>
    <li> i have dry, bleach blonde hair, also with keratin treatment, and heat styling 2-3x a week. i have cycled through every conditiner from very expensive to drugstore brand, everything on the market. this deep conditioner smells so amazing and makes even my dry brittle hair feel super soft and shiny. its truly a miracle cream! i only wish they sold it in more places because i have only found it on amazon or at a very small local privately owned beauty supply store. throw every other conditioner in the garbage - you wont find better than this!</li>
    <li> excellent product for hair conditioning and detangling</li>
    <li> This works real well especially on dry brittle hair. I also recommend it for any type of hair natural or relaxed etc</li>
    <li> Great one although not the same as it use to be, item is not the same as pictured, they have couple versions of the same product and the one pictured works slightly better. Order elsewhere if you want the pictured item!</li>
    <li> I use this hair product every week and my hair looks shiny, easy to manage and healthy. Found it at a better price at a local beauty store though but the product itself is wonderful</li>
    <li> Best conditioner there is!</li>
    <li> This creme is excellent.  The air is so dry in Colorado that an ordinary conditioner is just not sufficient.  My hair is much more manageable now.</li>
    <li> Great conditioner for dry curly hair! It&#x27;s all I use now.</li>
    <li> Good hair mask creme from L&#x27;oreal.It gave smoothness to my dry hair.After trying many other products this one  gave good results.Though you see difference after 2-3 wash but effect is long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have color hair it will definitely benefit you .Fragnance is ok unlike other hair masks and L&#x27;oreal products .Doesnt give much shine to hair but repairs frizz and dryness for sure.Worth trying.</li>

    <li> Item received not as pictured.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic if you have colored hair and want your hair to look shiny and soft. It lasts forever too.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes even damaged hair</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner. Highly obsessed!</li>
    <li> This is a product that I have been buying for over 7 years at Sally&#x27;s.  It smells like heaven. When you use it, you will realize the potential of softness your hair is actually capable of not matter what shampoo you use. I use different shampoos, one for dry hair, one that is Paul Mitchell, and Suave Tropical Coconut Shampoo (which I buy at the dollar store).. and this conditioner still manages to make my hair smell so great. My hair is sooooo soft and so clean, that when I use a straight iron, my hair looks extremely healthy and shiny. A final though.. a little goes a long way with this product. One container lasts me about a month and I have medium length hair. Best beauty item to ever buy.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed!</li>
