<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this for me and my mother.  She talked me into it.  I was skeptical, but it really does work.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product as well. I gave a review of some of the other products I have purchased and this one is no exception. I really can not say enough about how much I like this cream. My face feels cool and soft. Really hard to keep my skin moisturized and I am loving this product. Customer service is exceptional! Try this product. You will love it.</li>
    <li> Started using after a TCA peel in combination with Super Vitamin C Serum 20% vitamin c and my skin looks fantastic. I have received so many compliments on how great my skin looks.</li>
    <li> This cream make my face very dirt  is now 4 weeks and I don&#x27;t see any results.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I&#x27;m a guy and this is a great night cream. No adverse effects.  Helping with my wrinkles and firmness. Also skin tone is better after only about 3 weeks.  Will buy again! BUT can usually find new cheaper on that  &amp;#34;auction&amp;#34; site.</li>
    <li> Average cream - I don&#x27;t know why they say proven anti-wrinkle cream because it did not reduce my wrinkles.  It is a nice cream but with the dry skin that I have, it did not moisturize enough</li>
    <li> Ok... so I&#x27;m a guy. I&#x27;m also early 30&#x27;s, and now more than ever, I am noticing things happening to my skin that have never happened before. Deepening of wrinkles, bags under the eyes, all that good stuff ;) I&#x27;m also not afraid to say that I am constantly looking for products that help rejuvenate my skin, and help maintain my youth. Its important to look and feel your best, and the Skin Refinery face cream has really helped me do that. Really. It has a beautiful non-greasy feel, feels light and most importantly, even after a week, I can see a difference. Reduction in the lines around my eyes and a tightening and strengthening of my skin. Its products like these that honestly make me excited to see how they go after a month or so. Can&#x27;t wait...</li>
    <li> reading instructions you need at least 30 days for really reviewing something of this nature.  So knowing this product is very clean feeling, great moisture would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used this cream now for 2 days, my face is already  feeling softer.&lt;br /&gt;So far I am really liking it but will have to to use a little longer to see more results.&lt;br /&gt;Love the pump on this item so easy.&lt;br /&gt;Try it looks to have great potential.</li>
    <li> love it, great under makeup!</li>
    <li> My mom and I have been using this for a week.  I will give you her review and mine. I am 27, using it as a preemtive attempt to stop wrinkles.  I have noticed my skin is glowing and my complection is clearing and firming in the deep wrinkled areas (forehead and corners of eyes). My mom is 57 and on the second day she was in love!  She noticed that her crows feet were starting to diminish, the lines around her mouth were disappearing, and her skin was overall firm!  She has also been applying it to her neck, and where countless other products have not satisfied her, this one has made a big difference, and the major one is that she is happy with the results!  UPDATE::I had to stop using this cream after a couple days because it made my skin extremly sensitive.  My face started breaking out in a rash around my temples and the apples of my cheeks. My skin got very dry, and it was very painful. I couldn&#x27;t even use sensitive cleanser on my face.  I discontinued use, and after a week and a half my skin returned to normal. (After heavy exfoliating at the end of the week)</li>
    <li> This facial cream with all the natural ingredients, has taken away wrinkles that others weren&#x27;t touching! I was surprised to say the least. I highly recommend it! I know you&#x27;ll be surprised too. I&#x27;ve tried A LOT of products out there, so when I get one that works, I&#x27;m a lifetime believer. I think you will too! I received this product in exchange to try for review purchases. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This product is great for three very good reasons. First is the dispenser, you press down the top and it comes out in a controlled amount.  You don&#x27;t have to stick your fingers in a jar, get it under your fingernails and waste product.  Second is the texture of the product - it is light and absorbs quickly.  It seems to me the older you get the heavier the cream tends to be, but not in this case.  I used to have to wait several minutes for other products to absorb before putting makeup on, but not anymore. And the third and final reason this product is great is because is works!  I used to use a face cream, eye cream and neck cream and now I just use this in the morning.  The look and feel of my skin has improved since I started using just 3 weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.  It really works, the company that sells it has great customer service, and they don&#x27;t test on animals - can&#x27;t ask for much more than that.</li>
    <li> Excellent skin care.  Improved my wrinkles and made my skin feel soft.  The ingredients are just what is recommended to be what will hep aging skin.  I used the products for over five months before reordering. A small amount  daily goes a long way  I would would give it a 10!</li>
    <li> I am dissatisfied with this product, and did not feel it is worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Keeps your skin looking flawless.</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful! Bravo to the person that created such a waste free way to distribute the cream. When the lid is removed you gently push on the top of the jar and presto the cream comes out. This system allows you to use sparingly so that the product will last longer. This cream is not heavily perfumed, not greasy, and when applied absorbs immediately into your skin. I  love the way my skin feels after use. Please wait a few in minutes before applying your makeup...this gives this great face cream time to absorb. I will be using it daily...so check back with me at a later date and I will let you know how it works on wrinkles. 55 yr. old female</li>
    <li> I bought this face cream because I was sick of paying for a brand name and not really getting good value for money.&lt;br /&gt;This cream is everything I need and more. Feels really nice on the skin, not oily and really makes me happy knowing I&#x27;ve got a good quality face cream on.</li>
    <li> My mother and I both tried Skin Refinery&#x27;s under eye cream. We were both really pleased with the results. I used it for my under-eye tired lines. It worked, and my mom began looking into other products. So I&#x27;m writing this review on her behalf. I&#x27;m a little younger than she is (obviously) and I&#x27;m not quite to the point I need to use this product. But she&#x27;s a bit older, and although she&#x27;s beautiful, feels she could use some &#x27;touching up&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother is very patient when it comes to beauty products. She knows that none will work over night. There&#x27;s no such thing as a &#x27;magic cream&#x27;. But having a regimine to heal your skin never hurt anyone, so she used this product for a good three months before deciding to review it. We actually talked on the phone about it, so I&#x27;m going to just say generally what she told me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing she noticed is that this product felt the same way  a tea tree mask feels. It&#x27;s an odd combination between moisturizing and tightening. It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, but you certainly feel it hugging your face. If you&#x27;ve ever had a facial at a spa, this compares to that. And I guess that&#x27;s a good thing- because spa facials are notorious for helping fight aging. So naturally, this product was mimicing that effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which brings us to \\&quot;Did it work?\\&quot;. Well- yes. It worked. According to my mother. She obviously knows her face better than anyone else. I&#x27;ve never seen her as anything but youthful, but she thinks otherwise. She pointed out how it kind of tightened the skin on her chin, and made her cheeks a bit more prominent. She also said it helped combat her smile lines and made her feel a lot more confident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother is already beautiful (as I&#x27;m sure everyone reading this review is!), but it never hurt to have a small confidence boost. That is exactly what this product did. Made a few small changes on her that didn&#x27;t look drastic or bo-tox-y. But just gave her a more youthful appearance. And at the end of the day, I think that&#x27;s something that every woman could feel good about. So I&#x27;m honestly happy she took the chance to try this one out.he day, I think that&#x27;s something that every woman could feel good about. So I&#x27;m honestly happy she took the chance to try this one out.</li>
    <li> Love the moisturizer!!! I use it daily - morning and night. A little goes a long way, skin feels so silky and smooth, and it doesn&#x27;t have a heavy feel to it either. Moisturizes completely. Will be a definite loyal consumer.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and after looking at the reviews took a chance...yeah! best face cream ever in my book, not greasy, easy to apply, great smell...my skin is saying thank you!</li>
    <li> this product is amazing..  the first time I used it I knew I was hooked. this makes my face feel so smooth.. my makeup worked well with it.. ladies even gents if you want smooth skin and fewer lines definitely buy this product.. you will see results right away        \\&quot;I received this product as part of promotion in exchange for giving an honest review.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! The product design is fantastic. I love that I just have to press down for the cream instead of having to dig out the cream with my fingers. The product to me is fragrance free and that is a plus as I hate putting on lotion with fragrance on my face. So far I&#x27;ve had no dry or tight skin like I usually have during winter. I feel as though the texture of my skin is smoothing out too! I&#x27;m looking forward to the end of the month to see the overall change it will have on my skin!!</li>
    <li> I really love the dispenser and I think it is a great moisturizer.  I pump alittle and then add my Vitamin C Serum and sunscreen and mix and then apply.</li>
    <li> First I would like to say the box this product came in was perfect! There was even bubble wrap in it! Next i wanted to say that i love how its a different design bottle. The lotion comes out from the top and with with to pushes its enough for my whole face. I also love the texture and feel. its not too greasy but you can tell its quality. I will be buying it again! Thank you! *i received this with a promotional discount*</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for a couple of weeks now. I have notice the wrinkles around my eyes are smoothing.&lt;br /&gt;Also my face feels softer and moisturized. Love the dispenser too, just push down the top to get the amount you need.</li>
    <li> I have been using Skin Refinery Ulta Effects Daily Moistutizer for a couple of weeks and have already notices a transformation in my  skins texture and eveness. I use it on my face, neck and chest - the serum dies not clog my pores - and my skin is very very dry. At night I use it again and also dan an extra amount under my eyes as an eye cream. This potion does it all - and I&#x27;ve used everything from Le Mer to La Praire! This is a great product -&lt;br /&gt;Ps. I love the pump dispenser which dispenses the perfect amount -</li>
    <li> I really like using this product. I&#x27;m about 4 weeks in now and have noticed definite improvements in my skin. Will continue purchasing as I&#x27;ve used a few duds before but this one seems like a keeper.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product.  I wear it as a base both under my daytime and night creams.  The softness is amazing.  I find myself just sort of petting my face!  It feels wonderful.</li>
    <li> So far I absolutely love this product.  I ordered five jars to get in on the special price. Have been using it for a week and love the way my skin feels.  Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see results on wrinkles, but am sure it will help in that department as well.</li>
    <li> My skin feels soft and renewed!!! Thank you!!! It&#x27;s the difference between night and day! Happy skin!!</li>
    <li> FRAGRANCE FREE! Sinks in fast, I have been using it for several days and I already see my forehead lines and crows feet dimishing! I love the air free pump depensing jar as well. Totally worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This cream leaves my face feeling soft and velvety..I use this cream in the morning and before I go to sleep....of course after I wash my face ..making sure my makeup is removed completely and then I moisturize.  I gave a four star review, since I have only used this product for less then a month.</li>
    <li> I recently had the chance to review this anti aging cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First impressions the jar was nice and professional looking. The pump built into the jar so no dipping required is my new best friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening the jar and pumping my first application it was just enough for one use on each pump. Right away I noticed the smell. If you are fond of Origins brand and their earthy smells it&#x27;s like that. It&#x27;s a bit off setting at first when you apply it to your face, but the smell goes away after it soaks into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as anti aging effects I&#x27;ve used it on my face and neck. I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference yet as I&#x27;m still trialing for the full 28 days. The cream doesn&#x27;t make your skin tight or greasy. It&#x27;s almost like a white gel base that your skin just soaks up. Very hydrating. I&#x27;ve only used this after showers before bed, and haven&#x27;t noticed any breakouts at all as my skin is very sensitive and acne prone to many chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overal, I&#x27;m happy with it. It does a great job. I&#x27;d recommend it. 4 stars only because the smell threw me off at first.</li>
    <li> I got this cream through I love to review. And  I love it. Not crazy about the smell. But it seems  to work.</li>
    <li> did not like it at all sorry</li>
    <li> I LOVE this cream. I use it EVERY day. and mix it with my foundation. It is a MUST have for me in my every day life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product in return of my HONEST review.</li>
    <li> Nice and smooth I love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for a few weeks now, and I can start to see the effects.  It smells wonderful and softens the sking.  I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many different creams, and I absolutely love this.  Great texture, and nice results.  I love the container which keeps the product fresh.  I have ordered twice now and received the package promptly and in good condition.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, I have extremely sensitive eyes and this product causes no reaction at all! None. Also, It leaves my face feeling so soft and rehydrated...I&#x27;ve even been using it as a night cream with really pleasant results. I would recommend this product to anyone sensitive eyes or not.</li>
    <li> I like how quickly I received the item. I like how it goes on and how my makeup goes on after using it. I haven&#x27;t however seen a lot of difference in my skin as I read in the other reviews before I bought it. But I am pleased with what it does for me as far as not being greasy and goes on very smoothly, and as I said how my make goes on after using it.</li>
    <li> Product was free to review. I noted that some of the very fine lines seemed to disappear after about 7days. The deeper lines took on a finner look. My skin was very soft with a sort of sheen</li>
    <li> Have just lately discovered Dr. OZ  and his recommendations for anti ageing of the face.  I started to use Serum C and this Moisturizer with Matrixyl&lt;br /&gt;a Derma Wand and what a difference in my face.  Dark spots, age damage  had literately gone. Puffy eyes gone. Firmness and even bags are packing to leave.  Recommend to Google Dr. Oz and his skin recommends and try his finding.</li>
    <li> Wonderful !. A noticeable difference in only one week. My skin holds moisture and that&#x27;s exactly what I Needed. Skin is glowing, fresh lifted. Thank You, Marie Gwizdala</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not saying this cream is bad, just NOT for me....caused Acne, so I stopped using it. I&#x27;m late 40&#x27;s, have an oily T-Zone, and normal skin everywhere else on my face.  I have always been prone to Acne, so if you are too, then this MAY not be the right choice for you.  I think it may be a little to rich for my skin.</li>
    <li> I am ok with it&lt;br /&gt;Going to try for longer period of time&lt;br /&gt;Make up goes on fine on top</li>
    <li> Ultra Effects Serum – My husband purchased this product for me and I’m really quite impressed. I haven’t used a serum in the past so it was a nice surprise. This is my second jar and I’m already seeing benefits. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t look 5 years younger, but my skin does seemed to have improved so I will keep purchasing and keep you posted. It’s in a pump jar also which I thought was pretty clever! Anna B</li>
    <li> I had never heard of this product but thought since it was on sale I would give it a try.  It arrived very quickly and I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5 days now and LOVE it!  It has a different feel to it than other facial moisturizers and I have tried (and I have tried many) and a little goes a long way.  It literally makes my face feel like baby&#x27;s skin.  I would highly suggest trying this product!!</li>
    <li> Hey  again people,&lt;br /&gt;I love using the Skin Refinery also.  I have extremely dry skin, so before using Skin Refinery,  I had to add Petroleum Jelly, better known as Vaseline.  I even had to add  Vaseline to my old night cream.  But with Skin Refinery I use it night and day without having to use anything mixed with it, and it works perfectly under my makeup.  Thanks again, it really makes one feel and look better.  God Bless</li>
    <li> Love how it makes my skin feel without feeling loaded down with oil crap..only been using a week so far great..post more in a few weeks</li>
    <li> The face cream is awesome!  First of all the way it dispenses is incredibly unique.  You have to see it to under stand, but you pump the top down and it surfaces up - you can grab it with your entire palm!  The lotion is smooth and fragrance free.  For me this is the biggest plus.  I cannot stand fragranced face creams.  I have extremely sensitive skin and have not had any breakouts.  I just recently turned 31 and want to take better care of my skin.  This cream is the way to go.  I can already notice that my face is smoother and more hydrated.  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> When I put this on my face and neck, my skin immediately felt renewed. My skin soaked it up. I have used it twice a day since I got it and I will continue to use it. I can tell a difference in my skin. Its like it has a glow to it. Try it-you will be glad you did. (I received this product in exchange for my honest review)</li>
    <li> Love this cream.  It comes out of a neat little pump jar in measured doses.  It&#x27;s a great day cream that moisturizes but doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy.  Make-up glides on easily over it. No greasy look or feel during the day.  Really love this cream!</li>
    <li> Love this product. The pump container is easy to use.  Have only been using for a couple of weeks so no great skin improvements to report yet.  Still would recommend for the packaging and price.</li>
    <li> I am using that cream only for a week. So far, I experience only positive sensation with it. I have a problematic skin: sensitive, breakdowns, fine lines. After putting skin refinery face cream, my skin feels nourished, light, and refined. In a month, I will write an update about my further experience. FYN, I usually use Shisedo,  Cristian Dior, and Lancome creams for my face.</li>
    <li> I AM SATISFIED WITH THIS CREAM HOWEVER IT IS A LITTLE GREASIER RHAN I LIKE.</li>
