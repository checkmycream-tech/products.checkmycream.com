      <li>But truth be told, they are really good blades.  </li>
      <li>Got a good deal on this pack</li>
      <li>These for me cut nearly as good as the feathers without any of the &amp;#34;harshness&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how anyone can write a good review for these.</li>
      <li>and I was very pleased with the result.  </li>
      <li>Nice shave.</li>
      <li>Best shave so far!!</li>
      <li>To understand if something is a good fit for your needs someone recommended going out and trying a lot of competitors.</li>
      <li>The Bic blade is far and away the best razor blade I&#x27;ve tried to date.</li>
      <li>But I really liked the Feathers more.</li>
      <li>I purchased a sampler back of razors and this is what seemed to work with my face the best.</li>
      <li>I ordered these for my Merkur razor, the blades are great all around and very forgiving for beginners.  </li>
      <li>so I could try more of them.</li>
      <li>Love these razor blades.</li>
      <li>For me, these blades are now my favorite.</li>
      <li>If the money is inconsequential, then I would recommend paying a bit more for the slightly better quality.</li>
      <li>and I could get them cheaper and in greater quantity.</li>
      <li>I switched to these from the Astra&#x27;s, and i like these a bit more.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t love them</li>
      <li>My favorite were the feather blades, but they are a bit pricey.</li>
      <li>I know a lot of shavers love them</li>
      <li>Gonna wait for a better price.</li>
      <li>I like them, and am glad for the purchase.</li>
      <li>I also purchased a variety pack of blades along with several packs off the store shelves,  And out of all of them these blades work the best for me in my adjustable Merkur razor.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used about 20 different types of DE blades and these have been the best.</li>
      <li>this is my favorite razor .</li>
      <li>Honestly, that&#x27;s my biggest take away, they are cheap and comfortable to use.</li>
      <li>I would suggest finding a mixed pack first if you don&#x27;t know which kind works best for you.</li>
      <li>Excellent for shaving my head, shaving every other day.</li>
      <li>I like the price and am glad to have more than a years worth of blades.  </li>
      <li>I ran out, it was an easy choice to reorder these.</li>
      <li>I prefer Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock yellows and greens, but Bic Chrome Platinum is a fine blade.</li>
      <li>I have to say that when I saw the Bic Chromes I thought, \\&quot;great....blades from the guys who make cheap lighters.\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>I was looking for a blade that would shave smooth, but this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
      <li>smooth close shaves with no nicks.</li>
      <li>It will take a bit more time to shave in the morning, but it is worth the savings.</li>
      <li>But, if you have more than a day&#x27;s worth of stubble, these will pull.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t get a smooth shave and cut my face a lot.</li>
      <li>But as of right now they seem to be way over priced compared to Personna and many others.</li>
      <li>I first tried them from a sample pack and feel in love with them.</li>
      <li>I chose the Bic because they are a great value, and are sharp enough to give a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I had initially bought one of those trial packs to find the brand I liked the most</li>
      <li>Super cheap and get the job done well.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s going to take something really special , as it stands now, to beat out Bic as my go to blade when my testing is all done.</li>
      <li>I got a good shave and only a couple nicks.  </li>
      <li>Husband has been shaving with double edged razor for a bit over a year...ordered these based on good reviews.  </li>
      <li>This is as opposed to the Feathers that tested a full 40% sharper.</li>
      <li>Like i said the reviews came up BIC being the 3rd best blade out there, and the second sharpest but for my skin, the way and frequency I have to shave it works perfect for without wearing down fast.</li>
      <li>These are extremely sharp and they are priced great.  </li>
      <li>The against the grain pass did a decent job and didn’t lead to any more</li>
      <li>If I come up with a good edge durability test I may be back because I&#x27;m just having to much fun with all this testing.</li>
      <li>shave got me one nick and razor burn (these things start out super duper</li>
      <li>These three blades have virtually identical width dimensions but the Bic blade is 0.0065&amp;#34; narrower and as a result you won&#x27;t get a close shave in a MILD razor.</li>
      <li>For under $30.00 I have a full year worth the razor blades.</li>
      <li>me these rank far below Feathers (best premium price blade), Astra (best bargin price blade), Personna, and Derby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They won&#x27;t have enough exposed blade edge in MILD razors, i.e., EJ DE89L, Merkur 180/23C, Merkur 34C, Merkur 38C to give you a DFS; they should work fine in more aggressive razors.</li>
      <li>The criteria I use for a good safety razor (in no particular order) cost, utility value, sharpness/durability, and packaging.</li>
      <li>Very good blades, these are sharp but forgiving for new safety blade users.</li>
      <li>This blade gave very close, comfortable shaves.</li>
      <li>The company that sells the sharpness tester (my instrument is the one designed to test straight edge razors) says that they are going to make additional test media available on Amazon</li>
      <li>I was also able to stretch their use out and get a few uses out of them and they still provided a nice shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My adventures have learned me an understanding that the straight razor is good for folks whom have the coarse beards and need something that can effortlessly remove it with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin I could see using this and being OK with them.  </li>
      <li>I admit I have just started shaving with a safety razor, so the shave not being smooth is most likely me and my technique and no error of the razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re just as good as I expected</li>
      <li>they hold an amazing edge and give an extremely close smooth shave.</li>
      <li>These are sharp, but don&#x27;t knick when used properly in a good DE razor.</li>
      <li>this is so that you don&#x27;t cut yourself often and your using the right blade for your type of skin.</li>
      <li>I will revise this if they do right...</li>
      <li>As is always the case, I had to shop around for the right blade for my face.</li>
      <li>I researched a lot when looking for the right blades at the right price.</li>
      <li>I was using in the Weishi (my usual razor) and got a great shave.</li>
      <li>I read that these were good blades to I tried some; I discovered that the blades were entirely acceptable, but that I don&#x27;t get as many shaves with them as I have with other blades.  </li>
      <li>YMMV, try a few different types to see which one your face likes best.</li>
      <li>These guys are a mild shave, really forgiving.</li>
      <li>They work exactly as they should.</li>
      <li>I can tell a blade that won&#x27;t work for me after the first 2 shaving strokes.</li>
      <li>After trying 30 different blades, these were my favorite ones.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I ordered these for my Merkur razor, the blades are great all around and very forgiving for beginners.  For under $30.00 I have a full year worth the razor blades.</li>
    <li> Ok.  But I really liked the Feathers more.</li>
    <li> Love these razor blades. I first tried them from a sample pack and feel in love with them. smooth close shaves with no nicks. I use these blades in edwin jagger de89 razor.</li>
    <li> Very good blades. I use them in my 1940 ball end tech razor. I shave my head with these and Wilkinson sword shaving soap stick with no razor burn.</li>
    <li> Excellent for shaving my head, shaving every other day. The shave is really close with no irritation.</li>
    <li> Blades are OK, but not as sharp as often advertised. Price is reasonable, and they last quite long, but don&#x27;t expect this blade to give you the bast possible shave.</li>
    <li> Nice shave. I have thick hair and this blades passes right through.  It&#x27;s gentle on the skin.</li>
    <li> He uses these daily.  They work exactly as they should.</li>
    <li> I had read so much about how &amp;#34;Feather like&amp;#34; sharp these were, and they are most definitely not. Twice now I foolishly bought 100 blades at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid if you have a tough beard.</li>
    <li> Package arrived on time and intact.  For whatever reason this brand of DE razor works best for me. YMMV, try a few different types to see which one your face likes best.</li>
    <li> These babies are so much sharper than my old blades that I had to change the way that I shave. I do not have to press as hard. I get such a close shave that my afternoon stubble is now my evening stubble. I like them a lot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used probably two-dozen different brands of DE blades in the last few years, and these are the worst I&#x27;ve ever tried -- by far. I nearly cried out in pain with the first swipe because it pulled and tugged so hard without cutting any hairs. Thinking it was just a manufacturing flaw, I tried two other blades in the same pack, but they were all the same. I even tried switching razors, using with my Gillette NEW, my Gillette Tech, and my Merkur 34C. Awful all around; I never made it through one pass on one cheek. I&#x27;m not kidding, I actually retrieved from the trash a Gillette Silver Blue blade which I&#x27;d used for four previous shaves and used it instead of these. Then I disposed of the whole pack of Bic Chrome Platinums.</li>
    <li> I bought these previously and had used all 100 blades. They were sharp and nice at a decent price. I was also able to stretch their use out and get a few uses out of them and they still provided a nice shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I ran out, it was an easy choice to reorder these. Unfortunately, when I received the second batch the first one was dull. I tried everything I could think of: tried a new blade from a different pack (multiple), tried a different shaving cream, tried to use a hot towel to soften the hair, checked that my safety razor was set up correctly... Nothing helped. I finally realized that the blades must be dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read 2 or 3 similar reviews that they experienced the same thing: dull blades, lots of dragging, uncomfortable shave. Very disappointing as now I have 90+ blades I have no desire to use and need to start again to find a new brand.</li>
    <li> Not much to say here. I purchased a sampler back of razors and this is what seemed to work with my face the best. I have only used one so far and its what I expected. I would suggest doing as I had done and purchasing the sampler on here as well as this product may not work for you as it does for me.</li>
    <li> Best shave so far!! The Bic blade is far and away the best razor blade I&#x27;ve tried to date. I&#x27;ve several other brands yet to go but it&#x27;s going to take something really special , as it stands now, to beat out Bic as my go to blade when my testing is all done.</li>
    <li> The reason these blades seem dull is that when they were measured with a micrometer they came up narrower (across the edges) by 0.0065&amp;#34; as compared to the Feather, Merkur and Crystal blades I had on hand. These three blades have virtually identical width dimensions but the Bic blade is 0.0065&amp;#34; narrower and as a result you won&#x27;t get a close shave in a MILD razor. They won&#x27;t have enough exposed blade edge in MILD razors, i.e., EJ DE89L, Merkur 180/23C, Merkur 34C, Merkur 38C to give you a DFS; they should work fine in more aggressive razors.</li>
    <li> I found the BIC sharp, however, could only get 3 shaves from one blade. The Derby Extra lasts longer, sharp as well but good for 5 shaves.</li>
    <li> These blades are nice and sharp.  They work great for me in my razor.  Very consistent from one blade to the next.  I&#x27;ve yet to get a bad bic blade.  Give them a try, you may like them too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note blades act differently with different razor handles and your beard type.  No one blade will work for everybody.  Buy a sampler, find a blade that works for you, then buy a 100 pack and be set for a long while.</li>
    <li> Well I guess I&#x27;m just having a blast. I tested the sharpness level of and reviewed  Feather double edge razor blades last week and then turned around and ordered Dorcos,  Derbies, Sharks, Personnas and Gillette Silver Blues.  I already had Astras and Wilkinson Swords on hand so didn&#x27;t need to order them again. I tested again with the same edge sharpness instrument that I had used to test the Feathers. The company that sells the sharpness tester (my instrument is the one designed to test straight edge razors) says that they are going to make additional test media available on Amazon and I may need it if I keep this up. I could describe the test procedure I used and make this review long and drawn out but won&#x27;t bore you with the details.  In a nut shell ;  while there appears to be some very small differences between these  various brands  in initial sharpness levels there isn&#x27;t enough to write about. This is as opposed to the Feathers that tested a full 40% sharper. Please don&#x27;t shoot the messenger!  I am not a Feather salesman. In fact, the somewhat anecdotal  preliminary tests I have conducted indicate that the superior edge on a Feather goes away very rapidly and much more rapidly than that of the less expensive brands but don&#x27;t chisel that in stone just yet.  Please keep in mind also that I tested only one product of each brand so it is possible that other models within the same brand might be sharper (or duller). If I come up with a good edge durability test I may be back because I&#x27;m just having to much fun with all this testing.</li>
    <li> I read that these were good blades to I tried some; I discovered that the blades were entirely acceptable, but that I don&#x27;t get as many shaves with them as I have with other blades.  They&#x27;re quite inexpensive though, so I&#x27;m not very bothered.  If you&#x27;ve been spoiled by using feather hi-stainless blades ... you might not be happy, but these blades are only about half the cost of the feather blades.</li>
    <li> I had tried these blades from a variety pack before and they were amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally got around to using these blades that I ordered out of the 100ct and completely disappointed. They must be a bad batch. Lots of pulling and it&#x27;s as if the blades are dull. I ordered them Mid Nov. 2013.</li>
    <li> I bought these despite the mixed reviews.  I suppose you can put me in the glowingly positive camp.  I got these and shaved my 1/2 inch long beard DRY.  No pulling at all.  Even better wet.  These are extremely sharp and they are priced great.  I happen to have skin that never cuts so not sure what it is like for people with more sensitive skin but I do have a very thick beard that these cut through with no problem at all.</li>
    <li> Husband has been shaving with double edged razor for a bit over a year...ordered these based on good reviews.  He said he tried two of these blades and it was like they weren&#x27;t sharp at all...did nothing.  We arranged to have them shipped back...it wound up that Amazon charged me a fee to have them picked up.  I suppose I should be arguing with customer service...but we have had a bit of a rough time lately and I just haven&#x27;t done it.  I will revise this if they do right...</li>
    <li> I found these Bic blades to almost as sharp as Feathers, but without the dragging. Since receiving them, I switch between the Bics and the Feathers depending on beard length.</li>
    <li> I just took up shaving with a safety razor about 6 months ago, and I bought a blade sampler pack at that time.  I have a pretty tough and dark beard, so I need a blade that shaves close and is sharp enough to not tug at the beard.  Having gone through 10 varieties of blades, BIC worked the best for me.  Plus they&#x27;re cheap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re starting out with a safety razor and have a tough beard, get a sampler pack, but be sure to try the BICs out.</li>
    <li> I bought a variety back on amazon before.  These were one of the best blades I tried out of it.  Got a good deal on this pack and now I&#x27;ll have razors for a few years to come.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a way around the high cost of razors, this seems to be the answer.  It will take a bit more time to shave in the morning, but it is worth the savings.</li>
    <li> I switched to these from the Astra&#x27;s, and i like these a bit more. They&#x27;re a tad sharper, but i seem to be less prone to knicks the way that i was with the Astra&#x27;s. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> After trying 30 different blades, these were my favorite ones. Great shave, virtually no tugging and no cuts. Unfortunately, they cost more than double my second choice (Astra Platinum). If the money is inconsequential, then I would recommend paying a bit more for the slightly better quality.</li>
    <li> I had initially bought one of those trial packs to find the brand I liked the most and this was it! They&#x27;re just as good as I expected and I am getting great shaves. This was the cheapest option I could find that I trusted, and they worked great. I would suggest finding a mixed pack first if you don&#x27;t know which kind works best for you. Some of my friends find that different brands work better for them.</li>
    <li> Ouch! Neither very sharp, nor forgiving. Didn&#x27;t get a smooth shave and cut my face a lot.</li>
    <li> I bought a variety pack a while back and decided that these bic blades gave me the best shave with the least irritation. Bought this 100 ct and haven&#x27;t looked back since. These for me cut nearly as good as the feathers without any of the &amp;#34;harshness&amp;#34;. Everyone has different skin and hair so what works for someone doesn&#x27;t always work for you. I would recommend starting with a variety pack to find what you want before purchasing an entire 100 ct of blades. Nothing worse than wasting money.</li>
    <li> I first tried these in a sampler pack of different brands. My favorite were the feather blades, but they are a bit pricey. These were quite good and I could get them cheaper and in greater quantity. I&#x27;m happy with these and have started giving them away to friends because I have so many!</li>
    <li> Alright, so they aren&#x27;t the cheapest blades but they are decent. They are pretty sharp so I can&#x27;t really complain about that but they seem to drag pretty early on compared to some other blades. Your mileage may vary.</li>
    <li> I get six or seven very good shaves. No cuts, no tugging. A great value too.  For me, 100 blades is going to a nearly two year supply.</li>
    <li> I tried four of the blades.  Couldn&#x27;t get past the first pass on my face.  It felt like sandpaper and my face was irratated for a couple of days.</li>
    <li> Most uncomfortable shave I have ever had!! Serious waste of money!! Only giving one star because i can&#x27;t rate zero stars</li>
    <li> Used this out of a variety pack and it was by far the worst. Lots of pulling and barely shaved any hair.</li>
    <li> Not very sharp at all</li>
    <li> Received 5 of these blades in a sampler pack to try out.  They were great.  Sharp and relatively long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on that experience, ordered 100 blades.  Most are quite dull.  Lots of pulling.  Uncomfortable to use. Have to make multiple passes to get a decent shave. Even then it&#x27;s not a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably will throw them out. Don&#x27;t know why they vary much.</li>
    <li> To understand if something is a good fit for your needs someone recommended going out and trying a lot of competitors. If this razor is the one for you, you should find your way back. I started out with using the Bic single blade (yellow) razors. As a member of the armed forces I found this blade very reliable for serving its purpose overseas. It gave me the skin tight clean feel that is needed to represent United States. I came back home to the Gillette Mach 3 which was the standard during boot camp. The Gillette Mach 3 is a superior blade. If properly stropped the blade can be used for an entire year or more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What brings me back to the BIC? The brand appears taken for granted. As a daily shaver, I do not need to hack at any coarse beard. In fact, I only shave to complete the work day without the unnecessary stubble, residue of yesterday&#x27;s lackadaisical thoughts. My adventures have learned me an understanding that the straight razor is good for folks whom have the coarse beards and need something that can effortlessly remove it with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Merkur long handle and recommend all of the following safety razors. The criteria I use for a good safety razor (in no particular order) cost, utility value, sharpness/durability, and packaging. My rankings are as follows. The asterisk notes approximately 100 uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. BIC&lt;br /&gt;2. Dorco*&lt;br /&gt;3. Astra*&lt;br /&gt;4. Personna&lt;br /&gt;5. Merkur&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason why BIC ranks high is because their blades are strong, thick and don&#x27;t rust. With this blade the daily shaver knows exactly when his razor is dull and ready to be discarded. The packaging is clean reliable and shows me that it is the same traditional blade that has been used by many in the past. I&#x27;m not looking to change the industry, I am looking for something sharp to rely on, and I think the BIC is my favorite thus far.</li>
    <li> I have tried one of these blades in a variety pack before and I was very pleased with the result.  When I got this pack and tried a blade and there was a lot of pulling making it very uncomfortable.  I&#x27;ve had other brands where one blade may seem dull, so I swapped it with a new one from a different box.  Same results.  I even let a buddy of mine try it and he had the same issue.  I tried 5 different blades from various boxes out of the pack all with the same results.</li>
    <li> These go into the hall of shame for me.&lt;br /&gt;First shave got me one nick and razor burn (these things start out super duper sharp)&lt;br /&gt;Second shave...meh.&lt;br /&gt;Third shave another nick.&lt;br /&gt;Trash can!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Feathers, blue birds, derby, lord, etc, you name it......only the Lords and the Bics get promoted to the dumpster.</li>
    <li> I can tell a blade that won&#x27;t work for me after the first 2 shaving strokes. I immediately change the blade when that happens. This blade gave very close, comfortable shaves. I use it in my Gillette Fatboy dialed to 5. I prefer Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock yellows and greens, but Bic Chrome Platinum is a fine blade. It&#x27;s in my rotation.</li>
    <li> These are pretty expensive compared to other options and do not give me a comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> Felt like I was shaving with a pocket knife!  I was looking for a blade that would shave smooth, but this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> In the past I couldn&#x27;t help but notice that everything I have used from BIC has been high in quality and value. These blades are the exception. Maybe I have a tough beard.These were the worst double edged blades I have ever used. They don&#x27;t cut at all, just pull.. At first I thought I just got a bad blade. After trying six on different days I gave up. Now they are in the garbage, threw out 94. I don&#x27;t know how anyone can write a good review for these.</li>
    <li> Do not buy. The blades are the worst my husband has ever used and left his face still scruffy and he felt like it was ripping hair, no shaving.</li>
    <li> I got a sample pack of 20 or so blades from all over the world.  The BIC blades turned out to be the best for my face and my handle.  Feather was slicing me up pretty bad and the others didn&#x27;t cut very well.  For me, these blades are now my favorite.</li>
    <li> Great blades. Super cheap and get the job done well.</li>
    <li> Worst blade I have tried, so far. These were rough and caused what I would say was severe razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me these rank far below Feathers (best premium price blade), Astra (best bargin price blade), Personna, and Derby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried these blades in vintage Gillettes, Schick Krona, Merkur Slant, EJ89, and an ATT - and they were poor in every one of these razors.&lt;br /&gt;I think the horrible BIC disposable is even better.</li>
    <li> As is always the case, I had to shop around for the right blade for my face. I need sharp blades that cut without pulling, as I have coarse hair. The choice was between Bic Chrome Platinums and Feathers. I chose the Bic because they are a great value, and are sharp enough to give a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the new Safety Razor shaver:&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t go on reviews alone. Shaving is an art—you must find the individual combination of soap/lotion and blades that works for you. What works for me may not give you a great shave (or it may rip your face off!). We don&#x27;t do safety razors because we&#x27;re in a hurry...</li>
    <li> These blades seem to shave quite well for me.  Received them with a razor I bought.  But as of right now they seem to be way over priced compared to Personna and many others. Gonna wait for a better price.</li>
    <li> Thank you.. they are perfect</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used about 20 different types of DE blades and these have been the best. I have medium to fine facial hair and sensitive skin. These are sharp, but don&#x27;t knick when used properly in a good DE razor. No tug, cut smoothly and close with less discomfort than cartridges. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a little sharper than the sharks. I used it in a ReMei razor and got wicked razor burn and a bunch of nicks. I can’t tell if it was just my technique or if the blades are that bad. I tried the buffing technique with two days growth. It worked well but again gave me a bunch of nicks. The against the grain pass did a decent job and didn’t lead to any more nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put the blade I was using in the Weishi (my usual razor) and got a great shave. I did a 4 pass reduction and probably should have gone with 3 passes. I got a good shave and only a couple nicks.  The jury is still out on the quality. The buffing technique did well but left a couple nicks.</li>
    <li> If your looking for a very sharp blade, do yourself a favor and buy feathers instead. I found that these tugged a little too much. If you shave frequently, these shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. But, if you have more than a day&#x27;s worth of stubble, these will pull.</li>
    <li> I like the price and am glad to have more than a years worth of blades.  I like them, and am glad for the purchase.</li>
    <li> I started wet shaving a few months ago.  I bought a variety pack to see which razors work for me.  I have to say that when I saw the Bic Chromes I thought, \\&quot;great....blades from the guys who make cheap lighters.\\&quot;  But truth be told, they are really good blades.  VERY sharp.  Much sharper that Merkur, Astras, Chrystal, Personna, and Dorkos.  I&#x27;ve used all of those blades, and the Bics are way sharper.  They really felt to be on the same level of sharpness a Feathers, which are renown for their sharpness.  Very good blades!!</li>
    <li> Rec&#x27;d Bic Chrome in a sample variety pack.  This is the first blade I have ever used where I quit mid-shave.  I was using a Merkur 35.  Shows the value of sample packs!  Does not work for me.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite razor . I tried a lot of brands and this one works the best for me they hold an amazing edge and give an extremely close smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Read some reviews online about the quality, construction and materials.  Very good blades, these are sharp but forgiving for new safety blade users.</li>
    <li> Sharp at first then dull fast but I still like them</li>
    <li> I researched a lot when looking for the right blades at the right price. What I found was that BIC wasn&#x27;t the sharpest and wasn&#x27;t the most expensive either. When looking for a blade you have to take into consideration your shaving style, your skin and shaving needs. this is so that you don&#x27;t cut yourself often and your using the right blade for your type of skin. Like i said the reviews came up BIC being the 3rd best blade out there, and the second sharpest but for my skin, the way and frequency I have to shave it works perfect for without wearing down fast.</li>
    <li> I was a newbie to DE shaving, so I started out with a sampler set from Amazon.  After trying all of the other blades, these were the sharpest and lasted the longest.  Will definitely buy these again after I run out.</li>
    <li> Possibly the WORST blades ever!  I was getting cut and pulling hair instead of shaving.  Gave them to a friend of mine who also wet-shaves and he found out these were knock-off imposters.  I will never buy these again.  Sticking with Merkur from here on out.</li>
    <li> Pain!  I threw the package away and put in a used  Personna blade before I finished the first shave.  Extremely dull.</li>
    <li> Kind of thin and not that sharp.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and product as expected.</li>
    <li> I also purchased a variety pack of blades along with several packs off the store shelves,  And out of all of them these blades work the best for me in my adjustable Merkur razor. I have a pretty tough beard and these really give me a close comfortable shave and NO razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;By the way I did try out the notorious sharp Japanese made Feather blades,  And even though I had my Merker turned down to #4 and eased up on the pressure my face still ended up getting a few nicks, but I must say they give me a nice CLOSE shave. I know a lot of shavers love them but I suggest you only purchase a 5 pack to try out to see if they will work in your razor and your face, Because what works for some will not work for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an update to my above review, Well I have going through quite a few of these Bic blades and what I&#x27;m finding is there is no quality control at the plant where these are made, the majority of them have been nice and sharp and have giving me a great shave,  while a few and I mean few (5%) gave me results like they have been passed around a cell block and used by 20 prisoners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have returned to using the few Feather blades that I have left over and I&#x27;m starting to have second thoughts about them because I have found that if I back off the pressure and set my razor to 2.5 and use a good hot shave cream I only need to go over an area twice instead of the 3 to 4 times when I use the Bic Blades.</li>
    <li> These came in a variety pack and were without a doubt the most difficult blades to use.  I have a very heavy, tough beard  and these pulled more out whiskers  than they cut.  Afterwards my face was sensitive for 2 days.  If you have a similar type beard you might want to try a different brand.</li>
    <li> I got a 100 of them off of Amazon, after going to local drug store and them wanting half as much for some generic 10 pack . I can only compare these to (10)Wilkinson Swords and (20)Feathers in a &#x27;56 Gillette Red Tip. I have a heavy beard and sensitive neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used about three blades in a couple weeks, shaving every other day or so. These guys are a mild shave, really forgiving. Unlike a fresh Feather, which will mess you up quick if you don&#x27;t watch it. Honestly, that&#x27;s my biggest take away, they are cheap and comfortable to use. They aren&#x27;t really the sharpest, they dull down pretty quick, but they are a very comfortable shave and haven&#x27;t caused me any irritation. For the price I have no regrets.</li>
    <li> These blades don&#x27;t hold an edge and only give me one or two decent shaves before tearing up my face. I&#x27;ll be trying something else next time.</li>
    <li> I admit I have just started shaving with a safety razor, so the shave not being smooth is most likely me and my technique and no error of the razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I only get 2 shaves out these razors before they start tugging and I have to replace it. It also always tugs when going from the jawbone to the neck. I do not know if that is normal wear time, but my expectation was to get a 5 day shave out of razor.</li>
    <li> These work but I don&#x27;t like them as much as the Merkur.  These are much softer blades but don&#x27;t feel as sharp as the Merkur platinum I had.  If you have sensitive skin I could see using this and being OK with them.  I&#x27;ve used about three of them so I have a long long long time before I buy replacements.  I don&#x27;t love them but I&#x27;m using them since I purchased them.  I have a sensitive neck which is why I purchased these (and the price).  I&#x27;d call my beard a medium thickness - blades don&#x27;t have too much trouble cutting it down, just takes it a few more passes than the Merkur blades did.</li>
    <li> I really like these blades</li>
    <li> Tried them and they&#x27;re doing their job. I decided to trade with my friends for their blades so I could try more of them. These aren&#x27;t that sharp though. It&#x27;s tough to get all the scruff and get the smooth feel.</li>
    <li> I should have read some of the other reviews here. I ordered these based on the great shave I had with the sample pack I brought. Sample pack Bic blades were great, no nicks, no shave burn.&lt;br /&gt;BUT these are nothing like the same quality as the sample pack. They are soo blunt they wouldn&#x27;t even cut through my stubble without a lot if effort. Don&#x27;t know if they are made on a different line to the sample packs but they are not up to the sample quality. Very unhappy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I returned these. Did not complete the first shave. I went to the local beauty supply and purchased Personnas</li>
</ol>
