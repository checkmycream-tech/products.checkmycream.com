<li> I&#x27;m not entirely sure why there are such negative reviews, but it seems like a case of not knowing your skin well enough when using products.</li>
<li> was in Sephora looking to buy my usual primer (MUFE HD primer), and was approached by a too faced rep.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> The product Smells weird and seemed like it was used.</li>
<li> but I just couldn&#x27;t get passed that weird smell.</li>
<li> no joke, its sooooo bad</li>
<li> but it made me break out really bad!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s disgusting.</li>
<li> Horrible for combination oily skin.</li>
<li> than i broke out HORRIBLY with cystic acne all over my face!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Causes breakouts and doesnt help the makeup last longer. Horrible for combination oily skin. Return. Don&#x27;t both with this.</li>
    <li> Great product!! Keeps makeup set for hours!</li>
    <li> This product gets the job done but leaves my skin feeling so oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin leaning on the more oily side so while it temporarily removes the shine... the rest of the day my skin feels like I could grease a pan with my face. It also doesn&#x27;t last all day nor does it make any difference in holding onto my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have oily skin this product is not for you.</li>
    <li> I spreads nicely, makes my face feel soft, blends well with my foundation, and has a nice finish but I just couldn&#x27;t get passed that weird smell.</li>
    <li> This supposed to be for sensitive skin and it smells like gasoline. It&#x27;s disgusting. I won&#x27;t use it I threw it away.</li>
    <li> This primer is an excellent compliment to your beauty routine! I start off with Too Faced Hangover RX moisturizer and then use this. My makeup stays on all day and looks great. Definitely will buy again!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It goes on smoothly and really does make your skin look flawless. I have very sensitive skin, so I can&#x27;t use some cosmetics because I break out in a rash, but this stuff I have no problem with. Also there&#x27;s no smell, which is nice.</li>
    <li> this goes on so nice... makes the skin feel better after each use.  its clear, so no messing with your foundation color.</li>
    <li> Got this thinking that this works the same as the other well-known brand to disguise pores. unfortunately did not live up to expectation, cannot cover pores much at all. package box was dented/wrinkled during shipment as well.</li>
    <li> Perfect primer before makeup application.</li>
    <li> Its funny how it says for \\&quot;Sensitive skin\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely sensitive skin...&lt;br /&gt;I was in Sephora looking to buy my usual primer (MUFE HD primer), and was approached by a too faced rep.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to receive a sample to try something new..well the primer was awesome!!! my make up looks really good..&lt;br /&gt;but than i broke out HORRIBLY with cystic acne all over my face!!! no joke, its sooooo bad im actually embarrassed.. and i honestly dont care about a pimple here there and over there.. but this is red inflamed and gross...&lt;br /&gt;so its a good primer but it just didn&#x27;t work well with my skin.</li>
    <li> I actually like the feel and look of it but it made me break out really bad!</li>
    <li> WOW! I bought this product recently, and I am already amazed by the results!&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely oily skin. If I wear any kind of makeup, my forehead will begin to drip oil. It is extremely embarrassing when I go to nice events and my makeup fades/streaks within a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several drugstore primers, but none compare to this one (obviously this one is a bit pricier).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, I put my makeup on at about noon. I went out in 100+ degree weather, and up until I showered tonight at 9- my makeup was flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No oil, no faded makeup. I am so excited!</li>
    <li> This works somewhat but if you have an oily face this product really only works for a few hours. I am not sure it is worth the cost.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good primer for like a Clinique or a Mac foundation that leave your skin glowy it is clear with a cream to powder finish type of feel monistat chafing gel works EXACTLY the same for way way cheaper</li>
    <li> Not for oily skin, too greasy.</li>
    <li> This is my second tube of this product. Helps to absorb oil and make a nice base surface for makeup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not entirely sure why there are such negative reviews, but it seems like a case of not knowing your skin well enough when using products. I have incredibly oily and acne prone skin and this is the best primer I have ever used. It applies smoothly, does not clump, does not peel, does not run or cause breakouts. It works with all kinds of makeup-- I use Hourglass, Chanel, and Lancome. It&#x27;s great for a barrier between your skin and makeup and it really holds my makeup in place.</li>
    <li> I bought this primer by mistake. So it was entirely my fault.  I love the Pur Minerals Primer!  This one was a bit too oily on my face.</li>
    <li> This product is Great for Sensitive skin. Finally something for Sensitive skin that actually works. It makes your skin feel smooth and it does lessen your pores without breaking out. I have very sensitive skin and some products that say for sensitive skin doesn&#x27;t work, this actually does!</li>
    <li> i love this my face is so oily i tryed alot of things but this is really good when u put it on it feels oily but when u put your foundison on it looks mate even when u put on the too faced primer you dont look oily it just feels like it i have not got oily at all will get this again LOve this</li>
    <li> Actually, this is my first primer, I am so happy to purchase it, it makes my skin very smooth, love it~</li>
    <li> Great at disguising my under the eye wrinkles!</li>
    <li> I like it. It works for me. Smell nice, spread nicely and evenly. I don&#x27;t have too much pores I need to hide, so I am happy with the smooth result.</li>
    <li> I originally used the original Primed and Poreless, but wanted to try this less oily one. IMO they are basically the same, however, I think the original works better to smooth my look.</li>
    <li> The product Smells weird and seemed like it was used. It works ok to me.  Nothing special. It says oil free but it makes my skin oily.</li>
    <li> Great product! Does exactly what it advertises it will do !!!!  My make up looks great all day after using this product.</li>
    <li> Mother nature has blessed me with some &amp;#34;ice-pick&amp;#34; acne scars and large pores. I&#x27;ve gone through numerous products attempting to conceal my uneven skin tone. This is the only product that actually does what it says; it makes my skin look fairly even. It doesn&#x27;t make my skin get more oily or feel heavy/clogged. It will usually last me 4-5 hours before I do a quick touch-up. I&#x27;ve been committed to this product for almost 7 months now and it has yet to disappoint me!</li>
    <li> I love this primer.  It fills pores and leaves your face smooth and silky.  It absorbs well and does;t make your face feel cakey or like you have a mask on your face.  It&#x27;s light and it doesn&#x27;t break your skin out.  I have sensitive skin and it worked nicely and did not dry out my skin.</li>
    <li> Love this brand to smooth over adult acne.  I would recommend it. I use it over the top of a mattifier.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t make a difference on my oily skin.</li>
