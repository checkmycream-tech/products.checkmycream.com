### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>And it works wonderful</li>
      <li>Its the best deodorant ive used aside from lavalin.</li>
      <li>This stuff was the best deodorant known to man</li>
      <li>I ESPECIALLY LOVE IT</li>
      <li>they used to be awesome.</li>
      <li>This is not quite a perfect deodorant, but I have found a couple of ways to overcome the down-sides so that it works just great for me.  </li>
      <li>I was so happy to find a non-aluminum anti-perspirant/depdorant that I was motivated to find solutions.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, it&#x27;s actually good for it.</li>
      <li>but now I&#x27;m used to it and am fairly ambivalent about the odor.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a man and find the scent to be a fairly gender-neutral talc-y smell.  </li>
      <li>I was using Lavalin for a while to good effect,</li>
      <li>This product works great, but has a very strong fragrance.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with NOW&#x27;s deodorant cream</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;ve noticed that that seems to shorten the effective period).  </li>
      <li>It would be nice if it came with some sort of applicator</li>
      <li>It has a very strong, flowery smell that does NOT go away.</li>
      <li>THEY PIN INTO YOUR GARMENTS AND WORK JUST FINE!</li>
      <li>It takes a while of use for it to work for many days in a row.</li>
      <li>Marigold are still used to make organic bactericides, and lavender was the top antiseptic (or concentrated and boric</li>
      <li>so that&#x27;s even more awesome.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a great product and much safer than antiperspirant.</li>
      <li>Instead of discontinuing it they should have charged more.  </li>
      <li>It depends on many factors in including that she had been using this longer than I have.    </li>
      <li>processing- and many soaps, deodorants/antiperspirants, cosmetics and moisturizers/lotions contain lanolin that are not labeled or go by the alternative names:</li>
      <li>The scent is nice and light.</li>
      <li>If it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it. :)</li>
      <li>I can go 3 days without needing to use more.</li>
      <li>I been using this stuff for many years.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately most of the time, even deodorants that claim to be organic would still irritate my skin.</li>
      <li>I am glad that it was cheap</li>
      <li>, that just doesn&#x27;t wash off easily.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s fine for me.  </li>
      <li>This is almost as good as the old formula of Lavilin...and believe me I know.</li>
      <li>So far it seems almost as good as Lavilin.  </li>
      <li>In my opinion it is an ideal deodorant, no skin irritation, good price and long lasting.</li>
      <li>Maybe if you&#x27;re a light sweater or senior citizen would this be true.</li>
      <li>Originally started on it</li>
      <li>One application lasts me about a week of no BO -- pretty fantastic!  </li>
      <li>I really have enjoyed this cream.</li>
      <li>and I was lucky to get a day&#x27;s worth of odor protection.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is worth a try.</li>
      <li>I have to apply it fresh every day.</li>
      <li>PERSONALLY, I DON&#x27;T CARE ABOUT RESIDUE BECAUSE IT WASHES OUT NICELY IN THE LAUNDRY.</li>
      <li>Sometimes it might be necessary to reply earlier that 5 to 6 days if you have a great deal of the bacterial that causes underarm odor, or if you sweated a great deal- like high summer in my area where 110 F temps for prolonged periods of time are possible.</li>
      <li>Ingredients are better for you than most of the other antiperspirants on the market.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I smell better when I use NOTHING, or just a little spritz or two of a fragranced body spray underneath my arms!</li>
      <li>It works so good you can put it on every other day.</li>
      <li>Right now I&#x27;m using it every 2-3 days.</li>
      <li>This stuff works remarkably well when it comes to smell, but I do still sweat a little with it on.</li>
      <li>This cream is so highly perfumed with some synthetic flowery stuff that it filled my bathroom and adjoining rooms with the scent as soon as opened the container.</li>
      <li>acid was the only disinfectant) used until the 1930&#x27;s when bleaches became more popular in surgery and the medical professionals as the newest wonder chemical.</li>
      <li>I think the fact that you don&#x27;t need to use very much of this product every day helps ward off the irritation.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also kept a more traditional deodorant product on hand to supplement this after the first 12 hours when I need to.</li>
      <li>Need a hot day to test which may not happen until next summer :)</li>
      <li>At first I didn&#x27;t care for it</li>
      <li>This really works!  </li>
      <li>I first purchased this Now brand of deodorant during an out of town trip.</li>
      <li>more likely they were reacting to contaminants that were not removed in</li>
      <li>It does not work for me in the hot summer months</li>
      <li>When I first used it, I made the mistake of not doing this</li>
      <li>AT FIRST, SO I JUST TAKE MY FINGER AND KEEP STIRRING IT AROUND ON THE TOP TO LET BODY HEAT SOFTEN THE PRODUCT ENOUGH TO TURN IT PASTY</li>
      <li>I first attempted a couple of these organic deodorants, which produced well inferior results.</li>
      <li>Usually only a problem when I am wearing a tank top or something sleeveless.</li>
      <li>I was so glad to find this product available on Amazon and for so much less money ($4)than the brand I used to use.</li>
      <li>I think I may try the actual Lavalin, but then again, maybe I&#x27;ll just stick with the body spray and my own natural, non-offensive scent!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t usually even HAVE much body odor to speak of, but I thought it would be great to have absolutely NONE, so I gave this stuff a try.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent product; lasts as long as the more expensive one; and I feel it is a safer deodorant than competitors.</li>
      <li>the reason i won&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that by the end of the day I do start to notice odor- which I guess is pretty good compared to other &#x27;natural&#x27; products.</li>
      <li>If I put it on before I go to bed, then the smell is pretty much gone when I wake up</li>
      <li>The fragrance of the deodorant itself was so strong and gross that it gave me a headache, and it took forever to get rid of, even after showering.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One might note that if you want this to truly be long lasting, make sure your armpits are trimmed or free of hair all together.</li>
      <li>While it keeps me fresh longer than most, I still have a slight funk at the end of the day.</li>
      <li>* gentle -</li>
      <li>The question is how much money does NOW FOODS save if I stop buying their product.</li>
      <li>, I just hope that it doesn&#x27;t stop working after too much exposure to my body...which sometimes things do.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s really reliable for 12 hours and becomes sketchy after that.</li>
      <li>We are also CrossFitters which means our workouts are intense.</li>
      <li>It does absolutely nothing.</li>
      <li>but I love it the other 9 months a year</li>
      <li>Apply once a week or every few days if you exercise a lot (of if you live on the Gulf Coast) and you will smell lovely!</li>
      <li>I have been using it a little more frequently just to be on the safe side, but will probably cut back to once or twice a week.</li>
      <li>Over time the cream works better and better as your underarms will have less and less of the odor causing bacteria present or available to make odors when you sweat.</li>
      <li>* keeps me odorless all day (maybe longer) - initially this wasn&#x27;t true.  </li>
      <li>Luckily, though, the deodorant is very effective, so I only use a small bit, about the size of a grain of rice, which means not very much smelly stuff is going on my underarm in the first place.  </li>
      <li>I guess it just didn&#x27;t mix well with MY particular body chemistry</li>
      <li>which was my main motivation for trying this product.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I have to reapply twice a week in the high desert summers, but</li>
      <li>I love this product, because it is long lasting just as stated on the product.</li>
      <li>I live in the Desert in Arizona, and this works just as effectively in high temperatures of summer.     </li>
      <li>It would be nice if they had a selection of different scents but the benefits outweigh what is only a minor grievance for me.</li>
      <li>I am yet another customer who started with Lavilin and noticed the change in the new formula, which does not work anything like as well as it used to do.</li>
      <li>My first complaint was that the frangrance is too strong</li>
      <li>It took several weeks of every other day application for me to be able to go for longer periods without using it.  </li>
      <li>I never though I was going to find something I could use without a negative reaction, but this stuff is gentle yet works better than anything I have ever used (except old formulation of Lavilin).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product fo the past 6 months and am fairly pleased with it.</li>
      <li>AND THEN I APPLY IT TO WET UNDERARMS TO HELP SPREAD IT FOR FULL PROTECTION.</li>
      <li>I understand from health care professionals in my family that we will be going back to using lavender oil (or a derivative) as it seems to be incredibly effective against MERSA and other similar things.</li>
      <li>So far it hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin at all</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So I have insanely sensitive skin and I try to avoid deodorant all together, but obviously you can&#x27;t. This stuff works remarkably well when it comes to smell, but I do still sweat a little with it on. I also hate the texture because it is a very thick powdery cream that irritates my skin sometimes, especially after I have just shaved. I like it a lot, and would definitely continue to buy it, I just hope that it doesn&#x27;t stop working after too much exposure to my body...which sometimes things do.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve never used long lasting deodorant, here&#x27;s how it works:  Wash your armpits (or feet) and apply a thin layer of deodorant gently wiping to spread evenly. Then just wash as you normally would but don&#x27;t apply any other type of deodorant (I&#x27;ve noticed that that seems to shorten the effective period).  You will notice that you don&#x27;t smell for up to two weeks especially after you&#x27;ve been using it for awhile.  I had used another long lasting deordorant before but it was so expensive ($12) I eventually stopped buying it. I first purchased this Now brand of deodorant during an out of town trip. That jar lasted a year! Because I&#x27;d never seen this brand in a local store, when I ran out, I figured that was it. I was so glad to find this product available on Amazon and for so much less money ($4)than the brand I used to use. I even bought some for a friend of mine to try.  This is a great product and much safer than antiperspirant. Try it!</li>
    <li> This deodorant has the same ingredients, in apparently the same proportions with the same efficacy as Lavilin, which I had been using for the past few years and it has the added benefit of costing a fraction of the price!  It&#x27;s faint scent is even better!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product fo the past 6 months and am fairly pleased with it. I used to use Hlavlin-which is similar but they changed their formulation and are completely worthless now. they used to be awesome. anyhow- this is the closest i&#x27;ve found to the old Hlavlin product. the reason i won&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that by the end of the day I do start to notice odor- which I guess is pretty good compared to other &#x27;natural&#x27; products. also works well for feet.</li>
    <li> This really works!  I&#x27;ve had this jar for a year.  Just like previous customers write, after a while you might or might not need it.  However, it has minimal antiperspirant properties.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on multiple reviews and comparisons to the namebrand \\&quot;Lavalin\\&quot; deodorant that is so highly acclaimed, yet more expensive. Apparently, you get what you pay for, because this stuff is HORRIBLE!! It has a very strong, flowery smell that does NOT go away. I don&#x27;t usually even HAVE much body odor to speak of, but I thought it would be great to have absolutely NONE, so I gave this stuff a try. Honestly, I smell better when I use NOTHING, or just a little spritz or two of a fragranced body spray underneath my arms! This stuff made me smell like I have never smelled before. It actually made me STINK! The fragrance of the deodorant itself was so strong and gross that it gave me a headache, and it took forever to get rid of, even after showering. I guess it just didn&#x27;t mix well with MY particular body chemistry, I don&#x27;t know, but I am throwing it OUT! I think I may try the actual Lavalin, but then again, maybe I&#x27;ll just stick with the body spray and my own natural, non-offensive scent! If it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it. :)</li>
    <li> If you have a problem with perfumes, avoid this product. This cream is so highly perfumed with some synthetic flowery stuff that it filled my bathroom and adjoining rooms with the scent as soon as opened the container. I had to throw it out. Since I found the perfume so overpowering and noxious, I never applied the product, so I can&#x27;t tell you whether or not it works.     NOW foods makes another long-lasting deodorant, a stick that is faintly scented with pure lavender oil, that keeps me deodorized for days and is virtually scent-free once it&#x27;s on.</li>
    <li> This stuff was the best deodorant known to man but NOW doesn&#x27;t make it anymore, which totally sucks. I had one jar last almost three years! Instead of discontinuing it they should have charged more.  I switched over to Lavilin but it&#x27;s just not the same.</li>
    <li> As a long time sufferer of allergic reactions to synthetic deodorants, I have not used regular ones for at least a year now. Unfortunately most of the time, even deodorants that claim to be organic would still irritate my skin. I first attempted a couple of these organic deodorants, which produced well inferior results. I&#x27;d have to apply these \\&quot;organics\\&quot; anywhere from 2-5 times per day to prevent odor, not to mention they were pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After which, I discovered Lavilin (R) which is very similar to this product. It is a cream as opposed to a stick or spray on deodorant and claims to be long lasting. It truly is a long lasting deodorant (I&#x27;ve heard claims of 2 weeks with one application), but runs at least $10 for less than half an ounce. I can say that the NOW deodorant cream worked nearly as well for me as the Lavilin and is less than half the price. This product will work for me on average about four days sometimes longer. It continues to block odor even after showering. I am very pleased with NOW&#x27;s deodorant cream and I&#x27;ll never go back to stick deodorant again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One might note that if you want this to truly be long lasting, make sure your armpits are trimmed or free of hair all together. When I first used it, I made the mistake of not doing this and I was lucky to get a day&#x27;s worth of odor protection. In my opinion it is an ideal deodorant, no skin irritation, good price and long lasting.</li>
    <li> i did not buy this.  how can i rate it if  do not have it.  so i can i put it on</li>
    <li> It takes a while of use for it to work for many days in a row. I have now been using this deodorant for 3 months and I can go 4-5 days before needing to reapply. It does not work for me in the hot summer months but I love it the other 9 months a year</li>
    <li> I COULD NO LONGER GET LAVILIN FROM MY LOCAL HEALTH FOOD STORES, SO WAS FORCED TO SHOP ONLINE FOR IT. WHEN I FOUND OUT NOW MAKES THIS PRODUCT, WITH DOUBLE THE AMOUNT FOR LESS PRICE, I DECIDED TO TRY IT. I LOVE IT! IT LASTS LONGER FOR ME THAN LAVILIN DID, SO AM USING IT SLOWER THAN I DID THE LAVILIN. IT IS STIFF TO START GETTING OUT OF THE JAR AT FIRST, SO I JUST TAKE MY FINGER AND KEEP STIRRING IT AROUND ON THE TOP TO LET BODY HEAT SOFTEN THE PRODUCT ENOUGH TO TURN IT PASTY AND THEN I APPLY IT TO WET UNDERARMS TO HELP SPREAD IT FOR FULL PROTECTION. IF YOU WORRY ABOUT WHITE STUFF ON YOUR CLOTHES, JUST USE UNDERARM DRESS SHIELDS TO PROTECT THE CLOTHES THEY PIN INTO YOUR GARMENTS AND WORK JUST FINE! PERSONALLY, I DON&#x27;T CARE ABOUT RESIDUE BECAUSE IT WASHES OUT NICELY IN THE LAUNDRY. I ESPECIALLY LOVE IT BECAUSE I GET THE ODOR CONTROL WITH NO ALUMINUM TO CAUSE BREAST/LYMPH CANCER TUMORS EITHER! SORRY ABOUT THE ALL-CAPS TYPING; I&#x27;M VISUALLY IMPAIRED!</li>
    <li> This is not quite a perfect deodorant, but I have found a couple of ways to overcome the down-sides so that it works just great for me.  I was so happy to find a non-aluminum anti-perspirant/depdorant that I was motivated to find solutions. I was using Lavalin for a while to good effect, although it has the same main problems as the Now deodorant, then switched to this because the cost is so much less.  My first complaint was that the frangrance is too strong and it is a blechy floral. Luckily, though, the deodorant is very effective, so I only use a small bit, about the size of a grain of rice, which means not very much smelly stuff is going on my underarm in the first place.  Once I am dressed, the smell is usually not too strong, and at least it is a \\&quot;clean\\&quot; sort of smell, versus BO.  I try to apply it at night so the fragrance can dissipate a bit by the time I go out.  One application lasts me about a week of no BO -- pretty fantastic!  My other complaint is that because it is a cream, the basic way to apply it is with a finger tip.  But then I would end up with floral-smelling dessicating  white cream stuck under my nails, that just doesn&#x27;t wash off easily.  So I started applying it with a home-made applicator (actually the back of a demi-tasse spoon) and that has done the trick for me.</li>
    <li> I am yet another customer who started with Lavilin and noticed the change in the new formula, which does not work anything like as well as it used to do. Lavilin is distributed by Now Foods in the US market, so to see them making a similar product caught my attention. This is almost as good as the old formula of Lavilin...and believe me I know. I live in the Desert in Arizona, and this works just as effectively in high temperatures of summer.     I think some of the reviewers who had problems do not either understand how to use the product or are expecting the effects of petrochemical and petroleum antiperspirants not a deodorant. For initial use, you need to skip using deodorant or antiperspirants for 2 weeks. Then take a shower and wash well under the arms (trimming hair or shaving improves effectiveness) and apply a small amount the size of a drop of water. The next morning you should wash off well under the arms and reapply. Never apply to broken or freshly shaved skin, just as you would not do any other underarm odor product. Sometimes it might be necessary to reply earlier that 5 to 6 days if you have a great deal of the bacterial that causes underarm odor, or if you sweated a great deal- like high summer in my area where 110 F temps for prolonged periods of time are possible. You only need to put the cream when hair would naturally grow in the armpit.     The calendula flower (marigold), grapefruit, and lavender in the product are naturally bactericides, antiseptics, and anti-inflammatory substances. Marigold are still used to make organic bactericides, and lavender was the top antiseptic (or concentrated and boric acid was the only disinfectant) used until the 1930&#x27;s when bleaches became more popular in surgery and the medical professionals as the newest wonder chemical. I understand from health care professionals in my family that we will be going back to using lavender oil (or a derivative) as it seems to be incredibly effective against MERSA and other similar things. They also do not know why but lavender seems to help ease the breathing of those with asthmatic and bronchitic spasms. If you do not know it, all three of these ingredients are non-toxic and are even edible and used, as seasonings in many places so do not be worried about any possible negative effects.    The only caution I might add is this contain lanolin, which is made from sheep- in case you are allergic to wool this might be a problems for a user. But few people are actually allergic to cleaned lanolin- more likely they were reacting to contaminants that were not removed in processing- and many soaps, deodorants/antiperspirants, cosmetics and moisturizers/lotions contain lanolin that are not labeled or go by the alternative names: Adeps Lanae, wool wax or wool grease.    This product will work if you give it enough time and use it properly. Over time the cream works better and better as your underarms will have less and less of the odor causing bacteria present or available to make odors when you sweat. I have to reapply twice a week in the high desert summers, but my 70+ year old mother can go 6 days to 2 weeks between uses. It depends on many factors in including that she had been using this longer than I have.    As someone with environmental illness, and chemical sensitivities I cannot do without this! I never though I was going to find something I could use without a negative reaction, but this stuff is gentle yet works better than anything I have ever used (except old formulation of Lavilin).</li>
    <li> This was a terrible product and absolutely didn&#x27;t work.  It actually made me smell worse!  I am glad that it was cheap or I would have been furious.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> I have been using this since 1994.  It used to last for 4 days.  They thought they would save money by replacing the zinc oxide with talc and now it does not last 2 days.  I am forced to buy Lavolin so I don&#x27;t have to use this every other day.  The question is how much money does NOW FOODS save if I stop buying their product.</li>
    <li> I have bad body odor and sweat on my underarms, so I purchased this hoping that it would help my issues and because it was cheaper than what I usually use. It does absolutely nothing. It&#x27;s white and a very thick cream. When I apply it the white still shows and gets on my clothes, so not to mention I can&#x27;t wear this when I wear clothing where my armpits can be seen. The only natural deodorant that works for me is SoapWallaKitchen sold on etsy. Needless to say I will not be purchasing this again and will stick with what works and have to deal with the costs.</li>
    <li> This product works great, but has a very strong fragrance. I contacted the company to find out what the &#x27;natural fragrance&#x27; in the product is and I am told by a company rep that it is a blend of natural and SYNTHETIC essential oils. I will not use the product anymore because of the chemical fragrance and I feel that the labeling is deceiving. I will also avoid Now Food brand due to their deceptive practices.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for about two weeks now.  So far it seems almost as good as Lavilin.  Harder to apply and has lots of Zinc Oxide which in the past caused a rash.  Need a hot day to test which may not happen until next summer :)</li>
    <li> I use this cream deodorant. I like that I can go 3 days without needing to use more. Originally started on it b/c no aluminum.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product; lasts as long as the more expensive one; and I feel it is a safer deodorant than competitors.</li>
    <li> I love this product, because it is long lasting just as stated on the product. It works so good you can put it on every other day. I would definitely purchase this product again &amp; again!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over two months.  It took several weeks of every other day application for me to be able to go for longer periods without using it.  I have tried every single other type of aluminum-free product and hated them--because they left me stinky!  I apply it about twice a week now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a learning curve about application.  The instructions are very vague.  My technique now is to scrape out a chunk on the back of my thumbnail--about the same size as the nail, plop that in the middle of my pit and work my way out in a spiral motion.  Both of my hands get coated in the process.</li>
    <li> This deodorant strangely stopped working for me, and they also quit making it. I recommend \\&quot;Kokomo Cream Deodorant - Handmade Creamy, Dreamy Tropical Deodorant\\&quot; by CrunchyBetty on Etsy. It&#x27;s all-natural and works 24+ hours.</li>
    <li> I have been using this same little container of deodorant cream for almost a year now and it&#x27;s fantastic, I&#x27;ve hardly made a dent! I have been using similar underarm cream for six years now and I&#x27;ll never go back to mainstream American deodorant. Apply once a week or every few days if you exercise a lot (of if you live on the Gulf Coast) and you will smell lovely! You can shower with it on, it only looks white for the first day and then absorbs in. No aluminum to worry about, it doesn&#x27;t clog your pores. You still sweat so your&#x27;re still getting rid of all those toxins. The main/active ingredient is the same as in sunblock (zinc oxide) - it just kills the bacteria that make you stinky. Try it!</li>
    <li> We have used this product for years. It works great, you only need to use a small amount, its effect lasts for a few days, and we only have to buy one or two per year.  THAT&#x27;S SAVINGS! Ingredients are better for you than most of the other antiperspirants on the market.</li>
    <li> I came to this product because I was wanting to find a \\&quot;cream\\&quot; deodorant that wouldn&#x27;t dry out and irritate my skin. Here are my opinions after using it for about 4 months:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt; * keeps me odorless all day (maybe longer) - initially this wasn&#x27;t true.  But after a couple of weeks of using it regularly, the odor-causing bacteria seem to have faded away.  Now I tend to do a \\&quot;full\\&quot; application every 2-3 days with a \\&quot;partial\\&quot; touch-up in between.  It only take a little dab every day to fill in the spots that have worn off and keep the odor away.&lt;br /&gt; * gentle - almost every other deodorant, even the natural ones, irritate my skin eventually.  I think the fact that you don&#x27;t need to use very much of this product every day helps ward off the irritation.  So far it hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin at all which was my main motivation for trying this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt; * sticky texture - Maybe they should call this a Deodorant Spackling because it has the consistency of wall spackling.  As a result, it tends to stick to your fingers on application.  This stickiness is probably a big reason for why it lasts so long since it wears away slowly.  But, as a man, it makes it annoying to apply to the hairy spots (I recommend doing a little trimming).  It would be nice if it came with some sort of applicator so you didn&#x27;t have to get it on your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral:&lt;br /&gt; * scent - Other reviewers have also complained about the smell being too flowery.  I&#x27;m a man and find the scent to be a fairly gender-neutral talc-y smell.  At first I didn&#x27;t care for it but now I&#x27;m used to it and am fairly ambivalent about the odor.  If I put it on before I go to bed, then the smell is pretty much gone when I wake up and I still get the protection all day, so it&#x27;s fine for me.  It would be nice if they had a selection of different scents but the benefits outweigh what is only a minor grievance for me.</li>
    <li> I been using this stuff for many years. Its the best deodorant ive used aside from lavalin. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> So far this seems to work as well as the Lavilin Foot Deodorant and it is less expensive. I have been using it a little more frequently just to be on the safe side, but will probably cut back to once or twice a week. Right now I&#x27;m using it every 2-3 days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over a year. Since leaving behind antiperspirant 4 years ago my husband and I have been on the search for reliable deodorants that keep us from smelling like people who only use deodorant. We are also CrossFitters which means our workouts are intense. And the gym has no AC in the summer so that&#x27;s even more awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. This product claims to work for days. Maybe if you&#x27;re a light sweater or senior citizen would this be true. I have to apply it fresh every day. While it keeps me fresh longer than most, I still have a slight funk at the end of the day. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s really reliable for 12 hours and becomes sketchy after that. But antiperspirant lasted just as long.&lt;br /&gt;2. Applying this stuff by hand is a bit annoying. It&#x27;s a thick paste and sticks to hair. So my husband has a rough time with this. I don&#x27;t because I shave.&lt;br /&gt;3. The scent is nice and light. I&#x27;ve had no allergic reactions and the scent is unisex.&lt;br /&gt;4. I&#x27;ve also never noticed and white marks on my clothes. Usually only a problem when I am wearing a tank top or something sleeveless. No problem with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is worth a try. I&#x27;ve also kept a more traditional deodorant product on hand to supplement this after the first 12 hours when I need to.</li>
    <li> I really have enjoyed this cream. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, it&#x27;s actually good for it. And it works wonderful</li>
