      <li>This is my first time using this brand</li>
      <li>Just they put another yellow sticker on the top of the MFD.</li>
      <li>the soap is wonderful, the company ships quickly, have been buying this item from same seller for quite a while.........my hopes,for future orders...that they take a bit of precaution so that boxes arrive without dents...and the individual boxes not have price tags(?) or any other stickers on them.</li>

      <li>Other reviews had stated that these particular items seem to be different than the normal medimix items, in that they don&#x27;t have the same fresh smell.</li>
      <li>The boxes that they come in have an old yellow tint to them.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This soap has a wonderful scent. I left some on my acne face overnight, by day two, gone! An all natural soap.</li>
    <li> Strong aroma. Love it. Will but again.</li>
    <li> This is is best soap I&#x27;ve ever used.  i used to stock up whenever I went to india.  It works best if you lather and leave the soap for a minute before rinsing.  Very soothing.</li>
    <li> Goof product for  your skin.</li>
    <li> Good soap if you like that kind of thing.</li>
    <li> EXPIRED! Don&#x27;t buy! These items are definitely expired.  I peeled back the stickers holding the 3 bars together and the expiration year was 2012.  These are almost 3 years past the expiration.  The boxes that they come in have an old yellow tint to them.  The soaps also don&#x27;t smell like the ones that you buy at the store in India.  They have an off smell to them.  Not a bad smell but it doesn&#x27;t smell like the original product that I bought in the store in Kerala. I would avoid it if I were you.</li>
    <li> my family like medimix. it good</li>
    <li> Smells not as usual.Afterfeeling is more allergy like compairing to the ones bought in store with fine expiration date.&lt;br /&gt;The expiration date on every soap box of the case arrived is glued out by a white stikcer affixing 3 boxes together.&lt;br /&gt;If sticker is removed,the expiration date info&#x27;s peeled out.There is no way to see it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s totaly unfair.Since this type of soap has an expiration date,it must be visible.It must not be hidden by any&lt;br /&gt;kind of sticker.The smell and the feeling experience with this sopa might be due to its expired nature,&lt;br /&gt;or it&#x27;s a very different batch from what I used to get in a number of on-site stores.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this soap as a recommendation because I get boils on my skin due to an autoimmune disease. I was hoping that it would help that but I haven&#x27;t seen much relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I can tell you is my husband absolutely loves this soap. It has reduced his acne on is back and shoulders and reduces odor and sweating. I love the fresh scent. Be careful as it does tend to dry out your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We buy a case about every 2 months. The shipper kiwi bazaar is always so prompt and we&#x27;ve never had an issue.</li>
    <li> I have tried others, but always return to this soap.  It covers all needs:  itch, deodorant, acne, and scent. It&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
    <li> I love this soap! It&#x27;s worth the extra cost, and does wonders for skin quality! I used to use it primarily for acne, but even after that&#x27;s all been gone for years, I still use it because it keeps oils down very well.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. From the past 10 years I am using this brand.Couple of weeks before, I bought 12 soaps. The soaps were delivered on time but all soaps are expired from the date of Manufacture. Just they put another yellow sticker on the top of the MFD. Its really unworthy to by this item</li>
    <li> I have been buying this soap for years and love its usual smell. For some reason, the last batch I got doesn&#x27;t have this exact same smell and I like it much less.</li>
    <li> Other reviews had stated that these particular items seem to be different than the normal medimix items, in that they don&#x27;t have the same fresh smell. Also referenced the fact that the dates were not available because that info was covered by labels. My take is that these items are definitely outdated.  But for the price, they are still worth buying. They don&#x27;t smell as nice as they usually do but they don&#x27;t have a bad smell.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using this brand and I&#x27;m really happy with this product and the price is right.  Thank you for making it available to those in need.  I love the smell and it seems to really being helping my skin quite a bit and I just starting using it.  ;)</li>
    <li> I love this soap. I keep a bar in each bathroom. It makes your hands and face so soft.</li>
    <li> Compared to what you&#x27;d pay in India, this stuff is extremely expensive no matter who you buy it from in the US.  But I love it.  My whole family loves it (dh &amp; teenage boys).  My order arrived quickly &amp; in perfect condition.  I can&#x27;t tell when the &amp;#34;use by&amp;#34; date is because there&#x27;s a sticker there on every box &amp; I can&#x27;t read the date.  But it doesn&#x27;t really matter because the soap works great - cleans well, great scent, gentle on skin (doesn&#x27;t dry us out) - without the use of a bunch of man-made chemicals, etc.</li>
    <li> Sometimes in the winter I have trouble with dry and itchy skin...this works great to minimize all of that.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery great product</li>
    <li> Have always lived this soap</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this soap! It smells fresh and clean. I use this mainly as a facial soap, however I plan to use it as a bath soap too. I like how clean my face feels. I even love how my washcloths smell!</li>
    <li> Good Deal! Fast Shipping!! Will buy again!!!</li>
    <li> This is best soap in case you have acne ,pimple issue and oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;it cause dryness , but you can use face cream to fix it.</li>
    <li> the soap is wonderful, the company ships quickly, have been buying this item from same seller for quite a while.........my hopes,for future orders...that they take a bit of precaution so that boxes arrive without dents...and the individual boxes not have price tags(?) or any other stickers on them. When people love the soap, as they always do, and we want to gift it to them, it looks tacky when the box is worn, has stickers on it or the box is torn because we pulled that stickers off. This includes the sticker that bundles 3 bars together. If it is for your own use the look of the box is of very little consequence...you will love this soap, you will smell fresh all day and it does not not dry your skin.</li>
