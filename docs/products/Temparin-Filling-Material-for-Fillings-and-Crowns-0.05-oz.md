      <li>LOL!</li>
      <li>LoL</li>
      <li>If your teeth don&#x27;t have many cavities, this is perfect to hold you until you can see a dentist.  </li>
      <li>2 more weeks till the dentist!</li>
      <li>Put it in as best you can on the first try</li>
      <li>Kind of chalky.</li>
      <li>Very easy to apply</li>
      <li>Okay if your seeing your dentist soon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I had to use this once on a trip to Greece and it worked OK,</li>
      <li>DenTek repairs last, at best, a day or two.</li>
      <li>and I was able to drink ad eat and</li>
      <li>OK GUYS</li>
      <li>I contacted the supplier and they gave me a refund right away which was good.</li>
      <li>This stuff is pretty good.  </li>
      <li>also the most important the pain stopped immediately.  </li>
      <li>Original Temparin would hold a filling for a month or more.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It removes easy or maybe I don&#x27;t know how to use</li>
      <li>These are great to keep on hand for before an international trip and the possibility of no dental office in the event of an emergency.</li>
      <li>The crown was temporarily corrected, we had a great weekend and the dentist corrected her crown the following week.</li>
      <li>I found out you must not talk or open your mouth for a good 2-3 hours once you put the paste in and put it in your mouth.</li>
      <li>that i put it in right.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Works for 12 hrs plus if you let it set the right way.</li>
      <li>It has to be the exact material dentist use,  because it stayed in place</li>
      <li>Followed the directions exactly and the crown falls out of your mouth in under 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>It did exactly what it claims to do.  </li>
      <li>My wife lost a crown on the first day of 3 day weekend.</li>
      <li>I thought I would experiment first before really needing it.</li>
      <li>Lenny noticed a large hole in one of his molars and he just happened to have a tube of Temparin in his car.  </li>
      <li>Herb Wilcox, a zoo attendant, accidentally swallowed a filling while chewing on a piece of ice.  </li>
      <li>Doesnt really hold.</li>
      <li>FYI, dont use a whole lot at once because it expands while its hardnening.</li>
      <li>I hope the new filling works as my tounge is getting sore!</li>
      <li>I hope American Wholesale does better in the future.</li>
      <li>i applied the temparin as directed, and was able to eat on the repair later that day, as i was in remote areas of nz</li>
      <li>This is the new type, not the same as the one pictured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Keep your mouth closed and shut tight for a few hours and its actually a good dental paste.</li>
      <li>Den-Tek has apparently acquired Temparin and imposed the DenTek recipe on the product.</li>
      <li>For those of us on fixed or no incomes without dental insurance, it&#x27;s sometimes necessary to do temporary tooth</li>

    <li> I followed the instructions well It didnt  work.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to have with me on hikes in case I need it to get to a dentist. I thought I would experiment first before really needing it. The product did not work. I tried using the material to temporarily cover the tooth and the stuff would not adhere to my teeth. The material just falls off?? I contacted the supplier and they gave me a refund right away which was good. So I am still looking for a product like this to have with me on hikes.</li>
    <li> I used this for my crown that popped out. Doesnt really hold. Perhaps for a few hours tops. Sometimes just talking or creating internal pressure in my mouth can loosen the crown. This is the new type, not the same as the one pictured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;Works for 12 hrs plus if you let it set the right way. I found out you must not talk or open your mouth for a good 2-3 hours once you put the paste in and put it in your mouth. What I was doing was sleeping with the crown, or putting it in the daytime and talking with it. Keep your mouth closed and shut tight for a few hours and its actually a good dental paste. Havent tried eating on it yet however, don&#x27;t want to test the limit.</li>
    <li> OK GUYS THIS IS THE I WANTED NOT THE OTHER ONE THAT DOES NOT HAVE PAIN MEDICATION IN IT SOO NOW TELL ME I AM WRONG</li>
    <li> It does the job temporary.  If your teeth don&#x27;t have many cavities, this is perfect to hold you until you can see a dentist.  It can last you for months.  It did for me.</li>
    <li> The product showed up almost a month late. I hope American Wholesale does better in the future. Hopefully I will not need to use this but I wanted it to be a part of my emergency supplies.</li>
    <li> My wife lost a crown on the first day of 3 day weekend. She was very much concerned and uncomfortable. She couldn&#x27;t believe I actually had this kit in my emergency bag. The crown was temporarily corrected, we had a great weekend and the dentist corrected her crown the following week. The product is simple to understand and apply. A must have for emergencies, you never know!!</li>
    <li> My cousin Lenny works as a veterinarian at the Morris G.  Fleirtzugger Memorial Zoo in Potemkinville, Oregon.  Herb Wilcox, a zoo attendant, accidentally swallowed a filling while chewing on a piece of ice.  Herb couldn&#x27;t afford to go to a dentist, so he asked Lenny if he could do something for his tooth.  Lenny noticed a large hole in one of his molars and he just happened to have a tube of Temparin in his car.  He patched the tooth and Herb stopped his habit of chewing on ice cubes.</li>
    <li> It comes with a plastic applicator and it did not go on as well as I hoped. It still feels like there is something stuck in between my teeth. 2 more weeks till the dentist! Yay! I hope the new filling works as my tounge is getting sore!</li>
    <li> This worked well for me.  It has to be the exact material dentist use,  because it stayed in place and I was able to drink ad eat and also the most important the pain stopped immediately.  Very easy to apply a very little serves a large area. It took me two weeks to get to dentist.  Remove it before I got to dentist, didn&#x27;t want to share that with him.LoL</li>
    <li> It did exactly what it claims to do.  I don&#x27;t have dental on my insurance and I needed to fix a minor chip.  This stuff worked like a champ.</li>
    <li> These are great to keep on hand for before an international trip and the possibility of no dental office in the event of an emergency.</li>
    <li> A different brand was sent. And did not work. I have used this item that was shown on the picture before and it last for weeks. No good👎</li>
    <li> For those of us on fixed or no incomes without dental insurance, it&#x27;s sometimes necessary to do temporary tooth repairs-- temporary meaning for days up to months. Original Temparin would hold a filling for a month or more. Den-Tek has apparently acquired Temparin and imposed the DenTek recipe on the product. DenTek repairs last, at best, a day or two. So I will no longer be buying \\&quot;Made in USA\\&quot;! Does anyone know of a Canadian or Taiwanese manufacturer of temp fillings? Please post their contact info here...!</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty good.  I had a broken tooth, and was filling in until I could get to the dentist.</li>
    <li> lasted for 2 days. I dont recommend it to any body, it is the worst deal ever. plz guys dont buy it.</li>
    <li> I had to use this once on a trip to Greece and it worked OK, so now I keep a few in my emergency kits.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve glued a crown with this for a month now and it&#x27;s still firm. But I think you can&#x27;t use it for holes, esp in the upper jaw.</li>
    <li> I rate this stuff at 75%. If you chew the wrong way or on the wrong food while its in your mouth, it will loosen up quickly,crack up in  your mouth and I always end up swallowing it. Watch out for white crumbs on your lips! LOL! Put it in as best you can on the first try and it will last longer or else you will experience the same.  FYI, dont use a whole lot at once because it expands while its hardnening. For me Its either a hit or miss that i put it in right.</li>
    <li> i am at present travelling in the southern hemisphere,nz and oz, before leaving scotland, i tried to think of all the essential travel items,temporary filling being one.&lt;BR&gt;and yes i did lose a filling on a rather chewy bit of toffee.&lt;BR&gt;i applied the temparin as directed, and was able to eat on the repair later that day, as i was in remote areas of nz, it was some 5 weeks before i could saee a dentist. the repair was still in place when the dentist inspected the tooth!!!!!!!&lt;BR&gt;thoroughly recommend to all travel kits!!</li>
    <li> For the &amp;#34;last days&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> The product does not work. Followed the directions exactly and the crown falls out of your mouth in under 5 minutes. Save your money.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work as I thought.&lt;br /&gt;It removes easy or maybe I don&#x27;t know how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you any way!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, does not work!</li>
    <li> Kind of chalky. Lasts 1 - 2 days only. Okay if your seeing your dentist soon.&lt;br /&gt;I expected a harder substance.</li>
