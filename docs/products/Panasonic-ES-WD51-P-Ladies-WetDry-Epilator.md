<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used it for 2 years. It is very nice now,  I like it.</li>
    <li> This Panasonic model is better than I expected and out performs the epilators I&#x27;ve used in the past.  This one is far superior, has more features, is easy to clean and there&#x27;s virtually NO PAIN!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE this product and would definitely recommend to all my friends and family!</li>
    <li> Lots of attachments for different uses and it&#x27;s lasted me longer than my old epilator already.  It does sting, but the cleanup is so much easier than waxing for a similar result.  I love that you can use it in the bath!  The parts come apart very easily making it easy to clean.  The bag is a lot better quality than I expected and makes the machine very easy to store. Would recommend for sure!</li>
    <li> This epilator has been a lifesaver! I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now and don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without it. It&#x27;s quick, easy to use, does a great job, and is so much cheaper than waxing. The first time I used it was a bit painful but I&#x27;ve been using it weekly ever since and I hardly notice it anymore. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Panasonic ES-WD51-P Epiglide Ladies Wet Dry Epilator, Pink one of the best epilators, I love it!&lt;br /&gt;Cool color, ... I like it!</li>
    <li> I love this Epilator. Although I don&#x27;t use it wet, it is the best and fastest tool to use for removing hair from the roots. For many years, I have used various products such as wax, etc. But this product is the easiest, cleanest, and fasted  way to use on my face to get those fuzzy unwanted hair - even after makeup. Being cordless and rechargeable makes it very convenient. Every woman should own one of them. It is the best gift she can give herself.</li>
    <li> I used to tweeze all my armpit hairs (I know this sounds absurd) every week and it took my a whole two hours for both arms. I didn&#x27;t want to shave my armpit hairs because my mom told me my armpit could turn darker. After watching xteeener&#x27;s demonstration on how to use an epilator (she&#x27;s a fantastic beauty guru youtuber), I decided to give this a try. Lo and behold, this works in removing my underarm hairs with minimum pain (the pain is EXTREMELY BEARABLE). Just to give some tips, make sure to pull your skin as tight as you could and place the epilator 90° towards your skin surface. No more two-hour hair removal, I could get it done maximum of thirty minutes with this :-) Good luck ladies.</li>
    <li> Finally an Epilator that take off hairs without having to pass it your skin over and over! I love it.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me. Returned it for a prompt and full refund from amazon. May be I could figure how to use? Which would explain the other 5star reviews.</li>
    <li> This is my second epilator.  The first one was from a different company and had lasted 15 years.&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic has a double row, but doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as my former single row epilator.&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is cordless.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been epilating for 20 years, I&#x27;ve had numerous brands, but this is the best! Don&#x27;t need a shaving attachment.. would prefer an attachment for the face. Just FYI the more you use an epilator, the less hair you will have. After a while the follicle dies. The first time hurts but after that it&#x27;s a breeze. With the gentle attachment I am now doing the underarm area without any pain. Also use on bikini area.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll be working at removing hair for a while and it has a really hard time pulling fine hair, but in general i like it.</li>
    <li> This is the first time to use this and i think it&#x27;s good enough for someone who find a new thing that useful and worth paying. That&#x27;s my feeling now. :)</li>
    <li> it claims it doesnt hurt and as far as epilators go, it really doesnt. i was amazed after using epilators for so many years i thought they all hurt like that but i was wrong. its a good investment worth the price and comfortable to use. its water proof so it cleans well and comes in a case so its perfect for travel. i am very happy with it. enjoy!</li>
    <li> I had the old version of this epilator and had to replace it when I left it on the floor for my boyfriend to step on. I tried to go back to shaving because I didn&#x27;t have the funds for a new one at the time. Big mistake. I decided to go with this one because my only complaint about my previous one was that it could not be used while plugged in, but I had loved everything else about it. This model is the same in that respect, but the battery life hasn&#x27;t been a problem at all for me (I&#x27;ve used it for 1-2 hours and didn&#x27;t have it die). This one comes with a beginner cap which I didn&#x27;t think I would use at all (epilating is never a great feeling but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it and a few minutes after starting I don&#x27;t even feel anything), but I decided to try it for my underarms which I had never done before. It made a big difference, it helped me adjust to the feeling and then after a few passes I switched to the regular head and finished. It does hurt but it is completely worth it to be able to wear a tank top or dress whenever I feel like it without having to plan and worry about shaving. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> It took me couple of months to try it out after I purchased. I am new to epilation and was afraid that its gonna hurt a lot.  But, to be frank it did not hurt much for my legs, but hurts a lot when used on thighs and underarms. I started with the beginners cap that came along with and chosen to use it wet.  But, soon after I realized that the pain is bearable, I switched to the advanced.  The area where I used with the beginners cap, the hair was not properly removed.  With the advanced level, though it was not so bad, but, the hair was not completely removed.  Hair was not removed from my legs, but, over my thighs every hair got removed perfectly.  This could be because it is the first time I am using this device, improper holding of the device could also be one of the reason.  What I hated the most with this device is that, the floor is all messed up with the hair.  The removed hair fell on the  floor and spread on the device also.  It would have been good if it could collect the hair as it removes.  I do not know how the other devices work.  The device cannot be used while charging.  This turned out to be little annoying in the beginning because, i had to recharge it after working on one leg.  Which means that, I had to wait till it gets charged and can be used only after that.  Hopefully when my speed picks up, I could complete everything before the charging goes out.</li>
    <li> I bought the Panasonic ES-WD51-P Epiglide Ladies Wet Dry Epilator on Amazon using my husband&#x27;s account because he has prime, but I wanted to review it on mine.&lt;br /&gt;I have been looking for an alternative to shaving for quite some time but had never found anything that got results. For reference I am in my 30&#x27;s and have very thick hair. In a word ITALIAN. I was an hour late to my own wedding because the hair stylist was not prepared for the thickness of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I had heard of epilators before, my mother would tell me horror stories of my aunt and the Epilady. So I had dismissed them early on. I tried Nair, and found despite horrible chemical burns the hair was still there. So I gave up..&lt;br /&gt;Then one day I was looking for a new car... Ha, How does this play in? Well they left me alone in a room with a TV that was playing \\&quot;The View\\&quot;, the kicker is that there were only guys working.. Anyway, they were featuring this thing I later found out has been out a while called the \\&quot;No, No\\&quot; I was very intrigued. So when I went home I looked it up, and it costs $250... Yikes... I did lots of research on it and it does seem like a good product but I do NOT have that kind of money to blow on hair removal. As I was watching videos and reading, girls were saying they used Epilation along side the \\&quot;No, No\\&quot;. That is when I started looking at Epilation.&lt;br /&gt;I researched what to look for and read reviews. I decided to go with a cordless wet/dry. Out of those the Panasonic ES-WD51-P Epiglide Ladies Wet Dry Epilator had the highest rating. So I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;Everything I have read has mixed reviews on how much it is going to hurt your first time using it. I have had multiple surgeries, I had a 8lb 9oz child with not anesthetic. I pluck, I tweeze, I have multiple tattoos and piercings. I am not a wuss. I have never had my legs waxed but heck, the pain lasts a few minutes and you&#x27;re good right? If you have had your legs waxed you will be much better prepared than the rest of us I guarantee. For those or you that haven&#x27;t I will warn you, all the pain you think is nothing does not prepare you for epilation... Your results may very of course but here is my account.&lt;br /&gt;I charged up the Panasonic ES-WD51-P Epiglide Ladies Wet Dry Epilator and then turned it on. It sounds like some horrible grinding weed whacker you are supposed to put on your legs!!??! Now you are tense and you know it is gonna hurt.&lt;br /&gt;TIP 1~ Start by placing it somewhere there is no hair then sneak up on a hairy spot. My hair was very short in my opinion, too short for waxing but PLENTY (read too long) for epilation. I read somewhere that you should shave and then start trying to epilate the next day. Skeptical me thought that would be ridiculous the hair would be much too short. Experienced me wishes I would have listened.&lt;br /&gt;TIP 2~ Shave the area the day before&lt;br /&gt;So I set the roaring epilator to my foot and sneak towards the hair on my ankle... And it rips the first few hairs from my leg. To those of you who have tattoos, the pain is similar, kind of like someone is raking a razor blade across your skin. Thousands of fine electrical shocks that will cause your leg to twitch. At this point I yelp and shut it off... And my husband begins laughing...&lt;br /&gt;TIP 3~ Only Epilate while ALONE... Having an audience just makes you more nervous.&lt;br /&gt;So my husband taunts me as I casually turn it on every once in a while and touch it to my leg. Finally I get up, take 3 ibuprofen, and wait for it to kick in.&lt;br /&gt;TIP 4~ If you have ibuprofen or something STRONGER, Take it..&lt;br /&gt;When I felt the medicine had taken effect I took my Panasonic ES-WD51-P Epiglide Ladies Wet Dry Epilator to my bath tub. I ran a pretty hot tub so my legs were covered and began to soak. I read another tip that said the hot water would soften the skin and open the pores making epilation easier. Not sure about all that but being in the hot bath made me feel more relaxed so it was easier.&lt;br /&gt;TIP 5~ Get intoa Hot Bath&lt;br /&gt;I decided I would show my husband and I was not coming out without smooth legs. I will not kid you if you go full tilt with long hair like I did it is going to HURT. A LOT. But, after a while it did get easier and has never hurt that bad since. That was the only time I took the Panasonic ES-WD51-P Epiglide Ladies Wet Dry Epilator into the bath or shower. I was able to use it for an hour before it died. I got one whole leg and below the knee on the other. Why one hour? Because I AM apparently a wuss, I tried to go mostly slow and get all the hair. Also it was quite a pain trying to keep a hold of that thing in the tub. The Panasonic ES-WD51-P Epiglide Ladies Wet Dry Epilator is egg shaped and made of smooth hard plastic. Add soap and you may as well trow it across the tub... I think this was a gross over site by the company. Is a little patch on Silicone rubber too much to ask on something that is going to be ripping your hair out and is made to go in the tub? My toothbrush has it for crying out loud.&lt;br /&gt;When I got out of the tub I wanted to continue, but this model will only function cordless. I wanted to plug it in and use it corded but even fully charged this unit will not turn on if the plug is in. Another Con. So with my mostly epilated legs, I went to bed.&lt;br /&gt;TIP 6~ Try to epilate at night, easier to go to bed and heal during the night.&lt;br /&gt;When I awoke I noticed I had an awful lot of stubble like the hairs were broken vs pulled. As I used the epilator I noticed I had a habit of going really fast when it really hurt. If you find yourself doing this.. Go ahead... Once you get that first time over (even if you think you broke more than plucked) it is a cake walk after that. When you do a new spot it will still hurt but you mind knows you can do it. Since that first day I have ran my Panasonic ES-WD51-P Epiglide Ladies Wet Dry Epilator almost every day. Did the first two, skipped one, did two, skipped one. I still have a \\&quot;stubbly\\&quot; feeling to my legs but no more so than shaving. There is a lot of bare patches I would not have with shaving. This feeling stays longer than if I had shaved as well.

    <li> I am the kind of person who shaves my legs every day because I can&#x27;t stand even the slightest stubble on them. This product didn&#x27;t work for me because when I wanted to use it, the hairs on my legs were too short to be able to pluck. For others that can allow their hair to grow longer on their legs, this product would probably work great...but I didn&#x27;t let my leg hair get to that point. I did use it on the area between my eyebrows where there are a bunch of little blonde hairs that are too numerous to pluck. It worked very well there. I would have liked to have kept the product to use for that, but it wasn&#x27;t worth it to have such a complex and expensive product to do the job that tweezers or wax can do. Other than for the OCD leg shaver like myself, I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I read all of the raving reviews and was so excited to purchase and use this!  I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times and it only gets the grown-out hair, the stubble is left behind.  I&#x27;m so bummed!!  I&#x27;m a female with the embarrassing and gross facial hair.  I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING!  I&#x27;ve even tried the items on the infommercials on TV!  I haven&#x27;t found anything that works better than the good ol&#x27; fashioned razor blade.  I hate using a razor as I have to use it daily and it&#x27;s hard to hide from my husband and family members.  I thought this would be the answer since it would get the hairs from the roots and I&#x27;d only have to shave once every couple of weeks.  NOT!!  It only gets the hairs that are longer in length.  Any female with facial hair knows... you do NOT want it to grow out whatsoever.  It left tons of stubble behind after going over the area several times.  Afterward my skin was so red and irritated and I got some ingrown hairs (yuck!).  I&#x27;m happy for the ones this works for, I wish so badly that it worked for me.  I&#x27;m going to keep it and try it on my legs since stubble isn&#x27;t as big of deal in those areas.  Oh, and no this epilator doesn&#x27;t hurt.  I&#x27;ve plucked for years and it took forever so I went to shaving with a razor.  Plucking did hurt until I got used to it, this really doesn&#x27;t hurt like I thought it would.</li>
    <li> So I guess I can&#x27;t complain about the epilator itself, because as promised, it pulls the hairs out just fine.  Used it on my legs and was impressed at it&#x27;s ability to make them smooth.  It wasn&#x27;t until a week or so later, when the hairs started growing back that I noticed a couple things that weren&#x27;t so positive.  First of all, there were lots of ingrown hairs that came in.  The weird thing was though that when the hairs hadn&#x27;t come through the skin quite yet, but were getting close, I had a few days of an uncomfortable, almost painful sensation when it was cold.  Basically experiencing \\&quot;goosebumps\\&quot; was really painful.  It felt like the hairs were standing up in their foillice under the skin, and it was definitely unpleasant.  That passed after a few days, then I got a bunch of bumps and ingrown hairs.  I have read from others that it gets better, and I sure hope so, or I may have to go back to shaving.</li>
    <li> Love it I use it on my legs and underarms and it lasts beautifully! it is painful until you get used to it which will happen after multiple uses. its worth it to not have to shave for weeks and the hair grows back so much thinner and it is easier to remove with each use.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item recently but with work and all I tried it without using the instructions what a mistake! The other day my husband found the instructions and told me I was using the shaver incorrectly. To my delight he was right I now use it every time I need an emergency shave. I love this product and will recommend it to every woman.</li>
    <li> Great quality, fits well.</li>
    <li> My sister came home from Australia with an epilator, (different brand), and after trying it, I had to have one. The one she had was way expensive, and this one came on a lightening deal, so I snagged it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time I used it, I did the wet option, and got about half my shin done before whimping out. Talk about pain! It&#x27;s not recommended, but I iced out the rest of my leg, and finished it. Icing shrinks your pores, and that makes pulling the root out harder. It may make it harder to feel, but trust me, NOT a good trade off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this on an ex-boyfriend who was way too furry, and way too willing to please, and he held out for about 1/4 of his back. Apparently it&#x27;s bad for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the pain, this leaves your skin hairless, smooth, and that way for a lot longer than shaving. I would be hesitant to ever use this near sensitive areas, like underarm. FORGET bikini. If you have a way you can numb your skin, or great pain tolerance, this is a great option to waxing or shaving. Make sure you keep your skin taunt just as you would with waxing, it does help with pain. Also, icing AFTER is wise and recommended... as is lotion.</li>
    <li> It broke after a few months ;-(</li>
    <li> HATED IT!!! So much pain as soon as I started with it. My tattoo hurt less, I had to return</li>
    <li> I love this product, I really recomment it to anybody, it is very soft with your skin I just can&#x27;t believe it!! I am very glad I finally found a good epilator.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been 4 years that I bought it, and still works perfectly! I love the epilator.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very complete.</li>
    <li> My mom, cousin, and aunt have been using epilators forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flash back: I tried them when the original \\&quot;epilady\\&quot; came out. I didn&#x27;t mind the pain (pinching) but it gave me terrible red bumps on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They told me they are better now, so I figured why not try again. I researched and read reviews and ended up with this one. Because it&#x27;s cordless, and it&#x27;s wet/dry. Plus the other attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time it did hurt some, but not unbearable. I did a little at a time (lower legs, then upper, then back of upper, then later closer to bikini area).  I have really thick coarse hair and fair skin so I can&#x27;t go more than one day without shaving, normally. It did give me a little bit of irritation in the beginning, but it went away quickly and wasn&#x27;t such that i couldn&#x27;t go out in public!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this!! I can get up and not worry that my stubble is showing through. I have had it a few weeks and use it about every other day, just for touching up. When you use it regularly it&#x27;s easier, and i can see needing to use it less and less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the other attachments too. I am very happy and would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> bought to replace my Braun Silk-Epil that is approx. 10yrs old. I&#x27;ve only used it dry, and there is only one speed... but it gets the job done. I&#x27;d give it a 3.5</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing!! This is my first, so I have no previous expirence to compare. But this thing is everything they said it would be. I got mine yesterday and already I&#x27;ve done my legs, underarms, mustache, and my whowho. (The whole thing!) My legs hurt worst of all. I thought that would be the easiest. just now I lathered it up and did my mustache it didn&#x27;t hurt one bit, it was easier than waxing. I love this thing. I just hope it last a while cuz this just seams to good to be true! Overall there is some pain but really its nothing like I expected. I love it. I just found my new best friend!!!!</li>
    <li> Still getting used to the epilator part since it&#x27;s been a while, and I&#x27;m a big baby, but it works amazingly. The shaver attachment is also incredible, and if I need to shave quickly this is definitely what i&#x27;m going to use.</li>
    <li> My hair grew back thicker since using this product! Waste of time and money. Please think twice before purchasing this.</li>
    <li> Having never used an epilator, I tried it briefly both wet and dry, and found it more painful than I was willing to tolerate.  My wife, who has used a similar device for years, was very glad to replace her Epilady with this well-constructed product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this epilator twice so far with no complaints.  I&#x27;ve waxed a lot of times, so the pain isn&#x27;t that big of a deal for me.  Plus I first do it while soaking in the bath (maybe relaxing in a warm and bubbly cacoon helps you igrore the fact that you&#x27;re ripping hair out).  It&#x27;s not *perfect* in the water, as others said your hair kind of sticks to your leg sometimes.  However, I like it as my first run, to get a bunch of the hairs now and a bunch more once I&#x27;m out of the bath.    I first tried the beginners attachment... eh, took too long so I immediately switched to the regular one.  Yea, you can feel it - little tiny pin pricks almost.  The second time was less painful than the first.  It&#x27;s really not a big deal once you get used to it.  I use it on my legs and underarms.  The latter is a bit more awkward because you have to pull the skin tight to get the hairs.  I kinda tried my bikini area, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s possible, I just didn&#x27;t want to sit there and figure it out.  I&#x27;m not that hairy to begin with, but having the hair grow even thinner is great.  I used to shave every other day, but started getting ingrowns, plus stubble is not pretty.  I liked waxing, but could only do it in the winter because you had to wait for the hair to be pretty long before you can do it.  Epilation is kinda of the happy medium for me.  I love that the hair grows in softer and thinner, even once it grows back it&#x27;s not as noticable.  I get barely any underarm hair growing in so even if what&#x27;s there gets longer, it&#x27;s not really visable unless you&#x27;re close.  Yay for genetics and epilation :P</li>
    <li> I have tried a few but none was smoth and eficient as this one. I used to feel a lot of pain and had to shave all the time, with this epilator I feel no pain at all and I get done very quick its amazing! I recomend it to all women, im even buying two more to my mom and my sister. Try it! Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I bought this thing when it was less than $70, so I&#x27;m actually shocked to see it at $122.00. That&#x27;s insane. I don&#x27;t think I would pay that much for it, but it was well worth my 70 bucks. It hurts when you first use it (or if you haven&#x27;t for a long time), but I like to just use it super quick every day before I go to bed to get little stray hairs on my arms. If I don&#x27;t use one of these my arms become gorilla-like with thick, dark hairs. I love this thing. It works very well and was, like I said, well worth my $70.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to think of not having to shave every day, but was extremely disappointed with this product.  While it did remove many hairs, it left a huge amount behind. I used is several days in a row, before a shower, during a shower, after a shower... still many hairs left on my legs. I would NOT recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I used to have an older model that I loved but finally burned out after many good years. I was really scared to try a new one.  But this one is reall y good! If you&#x27;ve never used this type of machine....well it hurts...don&#x27;t kid yourself..you are plucking hair out of your body...it&#x27;s no secret. But...you DO get used to it. For me, a seasoned pro, it only hurts in the areas where the the hair fine. But I don&#x27;t care because my hairs grow back softer and fewer. I Refuse to go back to shaving. I did once and it made my hair course. After two session with this machine they grew back softer. I highly recommend it.  I did try it wet and it doesn&#x27;t work as well. But I think it should be used dry anyway which is why I gave it five stars.</li>
    <li> Just got this one after studying all the different options. Love it so far!   The price is good comparing to other ones. Got my armpits shaved and it looks and feels just like when I wax it. Way easier than waxing though!</li>
    <li> The Panasonic ES-WD51-P epilator worked very well; I liked the fact that there is a cover for less epilating area and that a shaver comes with it; it is easy to clean and charge.  A few small negatives:  the charging scheme of a blinking light seems counter-intuitive because a solid light to indicate that it is fully charged seems more logical; also, the plastic can get slippery when wet and some rubber grippers on the outside would help prevent the epilator/shaver from slipping from my hands onto the bathroom floor.  All in all, though, a good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very lazy at leaving reviews, but I have to write a review about this epilator. I wish I knew about it years ago. Shaving was not good at all, it made my skin bumpy and itchy. But when I epilated, my hair grew out slower, about 1 or 2 weeks later :)     I thought it would hurt a lot, I was scared but when I tried it, it wasn&#x27;t that bad at all. In fact, waxing is MUCH more painful than epilating :)    It was very fast when epilating as well, my new best friend. It works when you take a shower as well, clean it up is SUPER easy.     Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  It works very well, and will definitely save you the hassle with shaving.  Worth it!</li>
    <li> I should start this by saying I am very new to the world of waxing and epilating.  I decided to try waxing one day to get some relief of the daily shaving of my lower legs.  It goes without saying how painful that was for me.  The problem I had afterward was that my leg hairs weren&#x27;t all the same length, so waxing missed a lot of them.  I didn&#x27;t want to wait another few days or even weeks for the hairs to get long enough...  I see my boyfriend every weekend and I don&#x27;t want him feeling my leg stubble!!  So I thought I&#x27;d try out an epilator.  I gotta say, the thought terrified me.  Looking at all those little tweezer/teeth just waiting to snag up my hairs one by one....  But I thought if I could suffer through waxing, I could probably suffer through this.  After reading up on several brands and models, namely Braun, Emjoi and Remington, I decided on this particular model.  Several reviewers mentioned the relative gentleness and overall effectiveness, and I was sold.  After charging it up, I decided to try it dry.  Several reviewers said it was more effective that way.  I&#x27;m not gonna lie---it hurt like the Dickens.  But it did pull out a lot of the hairs the wax missed.  Also, like mentioned previously, it did not get all of them.  But it did get most and that was enough.  I use this about once a week or so and haven&#x27;t waxed since that first time.  My hairs just don&#x27;t grow at the same time.  The epilator seems to make more sense for my situation.  I also haven&#x27;t used it anywhere else, so I can&#x27;t rate any of those pain levels.  Let&#x27;s just say that judging by the way it felt on my legs, I will probably most likely never ever attempt it in more sensitive parts.      However, it is sorta true that you kinda get used to the pain after a while.  It&#x27;s only been about a month or so since I purchased this, so I must&#x27;ve used it maybe 4 or 5 times, and each time it gets a little more tolerable.  And my leg hairs grow back softer and finer, so this was definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> Okay so I never write reviews but I just had to write one. I have gotten so tired of shaving because I always get razor burn and the hair just grows back so fast. I heard about epilators from a friend, this one sounded like a good buy so i went ahead and bought it. I didnt want anything to cheap or to expensive so this was a pretty good deal. At first I used to the gentle cap because i was scared but i feel like it is better if you dont have any cap on it, it grabs more hair. Anyways, i started on my leg first and let me tell you, it HURT!! I tried ice, i took some tylenol but it did nothing. it hurts the most by your ankles and your shin. well, i had to do it in sessions and it took me a whole hour and a half just for one leg. Then i decided to get brave and do my underarm. well, i couldnt do it alone cause i was going cross-eyed. So i had my husband do it for me, he used to pluck my underarms so i was already a little used to the pain...so i thought. The underarms are absolutely PAINFUL. it bled and ouch, it just hurt alot. after we finished i did my arm which wasnt so bad then I gave it a rest for the night. My leg were covered in red bumps so i exfoliated it and most of it was gone the next day. The next night i went for my other half of my body, i already knew how the pain was going to be so it wasnt so bad on my leg. my underarm, again was extremely painful. its still a little sore after 2 days and there are a few hairs that are growing in. i have gone over my legs everyday to catch stray hairs. All in all, I havent had it long enough to say whether the results are amazing or not. but so far it seems like the first time removing the hair is the worst and it does get better. Ive only had it for about a week and I just love it. I have never gotten waxed before because I just dont want to spend the money. I think this is a really good purchase so far and i highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> If somebody tells u it doesn&#x27;t hurt while using this depilator they LIE!!!   it hurts but it does the job..pulls all the hair with the precision battery last long and charges quick.. its small and pretty.  i love it and using it on my legs and arms.. would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I think I read every review of every hair plucking device on Amazon before making my purchase. Good entertainment, and very interesting how varied people&#x27;s experiences are. The one universal truth that seemed to emerge, and that I am happy to confirm, is that no matter what your experience, it gets easier after the first time. My theory is that going after any part of your body when it is at its hairiest is going to be the most difficult. Think about the difference of experience of say, plucking out one grey hair vs. someone taking a handful of your hair and trying to yank it out. So as you continue to use the epilator, your hairs are on all different cycles and you are not going after so many at a time with regular use. It doesn&#x27;t take long to run this over your main hairy parts, and doing it regularly will keep the pain levels manageable. I do agree though, that you will not get the silky smooth feeling of freshly shaved legs with this. However, I am able to get my underarms even smoother and better looking than a razor. I will now comment on the pain levels. For me it is 1)underarms - most painful and most worth it - brought a tear to my eye the first time. got used to it, but still I put it up there with waxing. love the smooth look when I am done and how long it lasts 2)bikini area - surprised me that it didn&#x27;t hurt even more. the fact that it is hard for me to see what is going on makes it more difficult and puts the fear factor higher. have had the little machine take a couple of chomps out of me down there, and trust me when that happens - game off until another day 3)legs - almost feels good to me. this is a good thing because it definitely takes the longest. no matter how many times I go over an area, never seem to get them all. Bottom line, you can have my razor.</li>
    <li> Great. Fast, no pain, no hair left behind. Also, it takes a long time for the hair to come out after epilating.  Exactely as advertised. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Wow, is all I can say.  This works so well, I am thrilled to have tried it.  The very first time I used it I let my hair grow to about a 1/4 to 1/2 an inch.  I used the Epiglide on my right leg and shaved my left leg with my normal razor.  Because it was the first time I used it on the second day I used the Epiglide on my right leg to make sure I got all of the hair.  On the third day my left leg had stubles, right leg nothing.  On the fourth day my hair on my left was long enough that I had to shave, still on my right leg nothing.  After the first 7 days I saw a few hairs starting to peek out on my right leg.  After 14 days, it was time to use the epiglide again.  So 2 weeks without hair was great.  My leg hair is medium coarse so it worked really well.  It only took 10 mins to do both legs.  It would have taken me that long just to drive somewhere to get it waxed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I like about this is it is cordless.  I travel for a living and end up with nothing really to do in the evenings so I will be taking this on the road with me to use while I am watching mind-numbing TV.</li>
    <li> I love it!!!! This one works fast and wonderful. I do have lots of hair on my arms and used it last night for  about 15 min and both of my arms are baby soft and hair free now. I am so so so happy. And yes , it does hurts.. we are talking about pulling hair out of skin, but I dont care, I got smooth arms and legs now and Im one happy girl today :)</li>
    <li> I only have previous experience with the Remington epilator through a friend, but I decided to go with this model because of the positive reviews.  The package comes with an option for electric shaving as well if epilation proves to be too painful.  With the Remington epilator, there were 2 speeds which this product does not have.  I think a two speed setting would have been more beneficial to women, especially since we all have different hair types.&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely sensitive skin but I prefer epilaton over waxing because it is less messy and seems to be quicker.  Epilators are going to be painful, (no different than waxing), but once you become accustomed to the level of intensity, it is fine.  My boyfriend tested it on himself and compared the feeling as getting a tattoo.  He said a tattoo needle is more concentrated, but it is fairly close.  How accurately everyone would agree, I don&#x27;t know, because I don&#x27;t have a tattoo.&lt;br /&gt;After I used the epilator, I have little red bumps all over my legs.  The biggest trick I have discovered in using the epilator, that the slower you go, the more accurate the hair removal.  As for ingrown hair, the best way to resolve the issue is to bathe in Epson Salts.  It is great for ingrown hairs and other skin issues! If I am taking a shower, I scoop up the Epson Salts in my hand and use it as an exfoliator like a body scrub.  Happy epilating!</li>
    <li> I have experimented off and on for the past 13 yrs with epilators, using them exclusively for the past 5.  This.Is.The.Best. Epilator. Evaaarrr!!!  It&#x27;s dry, it&#x27;s wet, it shaves, it epilates aaaaand - it&#x27;s cordless!!!  What else can a hirsute gal ask for?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using it is the least uncomfortable experience I&#x27;ve had.  I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s painless because let&#x27;s face it, we&#x27;re talking about pulling hairs out from the roots here. I used it the first time dry and the used it on my arms in the shower - why didn&#x27;t I do this sooner?!!? Gosh.  So easy and way more comfortable!  I haven&#x27;t used the shaver yet and honestly don&#x27;t plan to, really so I couldn&#x27;t tell you about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best epilator purchase ever.  :)</li>
    <li> my second, first is 10y.o but still worked</li>
    <li> I owned the earlier model of this product (can&#x27;t remember the model # at this time) for several years.  I loved it, but I traveled with it frequently and forgot to put the cap on it, so the little metal guides across the top of the epilator attachment were bent. That&#x27;s totally my fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this new model!  It seems to remove the hair from the root better than the older one.  And the on/off switch is much easier to use in the shower.  Instead of trying to slide the switch back and forth with soapy hands, this one is just a push-button.  Great improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t really speak to the pain factor, because I have been using products like these for years.  I&#x27;m pretty much immune to the pain.  But as far as ease of use, effectiveness, battery life, etc., this is a great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been an avid leg waxer for years. But the brand I liked went off the market, leaving me struggling to find a replacement. I&#x27;d tried the Epilady back in the day, and within moments had thrown it across the room in sheer pain from its tortuous spring action. A friend had an Eplilator last month and told me it was great, so I decided to give this one a try.  I&#x27;ll start by saying that for any first timer or someone who has not waxed in a while, this may be painful because you have so many active follicles. But the device has a couple options - one for beginners where some of the rotating hair suckers are shielded from your skin, and one level for advanced. I skipped right to advanced since I&#x27;ve been waxing and thus have less active hair. It only hurt in the more hairy spots. It takes a while, say 20 minutes, to get round your whole leg.  And it does NOT pull all the hairs as waxing would.  But it gets rid of most of them and the result is smooth legs with fewer follicles to create that sharp day two stubble! AND it comes with a nifty little shaver too for bikini areas etc.  Last plus: you can use it in the shower with soap as an option. Best of all, no more messy wax!</li>
    <li> This was my first experience with an epilator and must say it is a lot less messy and less painful that ripping the hair off using wax. I noticed less hair regrowth after the first use, so I like that. I can&#x27;t compare it to other epilators, but think I&#x27;ll stick with this method of hair removal. It&#x27;s great that it is cordless and can be used for 40 minutes at a time. That should be adequate time for a thorough job.</li>
    <li> Being endowed with very pale skin, and dark, quick growing leg hairs, I&#x27;ve never been satisfied with any of the hair removal products. Shaving would get my legs smooth, but only for about 12 hours, and that&#x27;s if I used a new razor for each leg. Otherwise, razor burn all over. Depilatory creams have a tendency to burn my hair follicles before the hair is ready to be wiped off. Waxing is so much pain over such a large area that I can&#x27;t handle it. I&#x27;ve lived my life in long pants/pantyhose.    At least I used to. While far from \\&quot;painless\\&quot;, the Epiglide is no more painful than dry shaving, and any irritation that I&#x27;ve experienced from it disappears within a day. After the first week, my legs were still mostly hair free, and the new hairs that had grown in were much lighter and much less painful when epilated.    I have not used this while wet. My hairs tend to lay flat when wet, so I figured that using it dry would catch more hairs.    I seriously never thought that I could have smooth, hair free legs for more than a day. It took about 2 hours the very first time I used this on my legs, and I didn&#x27;t touch them again for a week. The second time, it took less than an hour for both legs. I can finally wear shorts with confidence, something my husband is very happy about :)</li>
    <li> I wanted to use the Epiglide for 6 months before reviewing. It&#x27;s utterly fantastic and has exceeded my expectations in every way. I have HYPER sensitive skin, and thought I&#x27;d be returning this as soon as the familiar red bumps appeared - but they never appeared!! I mostly wanted it for the bikini area cause I&#x27;ve only shaved that area twice in 55 years. There&#x27;s a special attachment for that area, the epilator can be used on it, but you need a high pain threshhold (this also applies to the underarm area). But on the legs, the epilator is awesome! The hair really goes away for 2-3 weeks, and grows back much less thickly. Just be sure and go s-l-o-w-l-y. I love the size of it, the color, the shape, and it&#x27;s not too very noisy. It&#x27;s almost perfect. This is a wise investment. Epilators are a girl&#x27;s best friend!</li>
    <li> I used an emjoi before trying this and did not like it because it snags my skin. This panasonic is really good. It can be used wet or dry and can be cleaned with water for hygenic reasons. It can be used any where in the world, has dual voltage. It performs really well , hairs removed in the first sweep. I mainly use for my underarms and legs, have stopped waxing totally, since this is not messy like waxing. easy clean up too. Love it.</li>
    <li> One of a kind epilator. This is the only epilator that I&#x27;ve used that has pulled almost every single hair out of the root. Sometimes it&#x27;ll miss a hair or two but I am not complaining about that what so ever. The only reason I gave this product 4 stars is because it isnt as effective when the skin is wet and I totally understand why that is but when the skin and hair is dried, this product doesnt play! it rips the hairs straight out of the roots, leaving me with hair free smooth skin. I usually use this product once a month since it does a fantastic job.</li>
    <li> When I made my purchase it was out of stock,  but would be in stock in 2 days... I selected the free shipping from amazon.. and to my surprise as soon as it came back in stock they overnighted it.  I was pretty happy about that.  The first couple of times I used this,  it seemed to not work very well.  Just a warning to you all...  don&#x27;t plan on wearing shorts the next day... My legs were covered in little red bumps.. it looked like I had some kind of weird skin disease..  I also recommend maybe having a couple drinks before you epilate for the first time... it freaking hurts!  it feels like a little razor blade rolling around on your leg.  A few days later I noticed my legs looked hairy,  I was in a hurry and decided to just shave my legs... but when I came out of the shower my legs still looked hairy!  I took a closer look and my legs looked hairy,  but my razor wasn&#x27;t able to shave them off because the hair was growing underneath my skin.  After using it for awhile,  I still get those ingrown hairs,  but they aren&#x27;t as often...  still doesn&#x27;t seem to get ALL of the hairs..but it does get most of them....  I also used this wet,  It seems to work better for me wet,  but I don&#x27;t always have time to do that..  I noticed when I use it wet,  my legs get less irritation and I have less ingrown hairs.  I would say it works so so for the legs...  But I do love it for my armpits.  I have been shaving my armpits EVERY SINGLE DAY since junior high,  because of this my armpit hair is VERY dark and thick,  I have fair skin,  so even after I shave I look like I need to shave again....  It takes some time to get all the hairs out w/ the epillator... but I only have to do it once every two weeks....  the hair is coming in thinner.... I definitely recommend it for the armpit area lol</li>
    <li> I used it a few times haven&#x27;t tried it in the shower yet, but I love how it works.  It it not painful (my husband says it hurts like hell, but he is a big baby like most men) and it gets the job done.  I have light hair but still I had to shave my legs everyother day, now I just use it once or twice a week.  I love that you don&#x27;t have to let your hair grow out like with some other epilators.</li>
    <li> This is the second epilator I&#x27;ve tried and I must admit, this may be a little pricey but it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Pros:  can be used dry  works well enough to not return it  cons:  hurts at first but there is no getting around that  takes 2-4 passes before a clean patch is achieved  sometimes does not tear out the root  thoughts:  takes abit of getting used to but worth the effort if you really hate shaving  if shaving is not a huge hassle then this is an option but a somewhat uncomfortable option</li>
    <li> After reading some of the reviews I was only a little hesitant to buy the product. But I was sick of waxing, shaving, and depilatories. I have dark hair and fair skin, so it always looks like I have tiny little black dots on my legs. Yuck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seemed like a really good idea. Before buying it, I actually tried tweezing a few of my leg hairs. I figured if I could stand that, I could handle this. I was right. One thing I can say for sure is to NOT use this if your leg hair is too long. It really is better to shave and wait a couple of days for the hair to grow, but still be short. If you use the epilator and the hair is too long, it hurts like HELL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it primarily on my legs, and arms. I&#x27;ve used it under my arms as well, but I would recommend only doing that when you are using it wet. It doesn&#x27;t give you a completely shaved feeling right away, because the hairs grow at different rates. But it is great that I don&#x27;t have to shave everyday anymore. I spot a few hairs here and there and touch them up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I can emphasize one thing- A LOOFAH IS YOUR FRIEND. You MUST use one of these to avoid ingrown hairs. I couldn&#x27;t believe it the first time I had one on my leg. Owie! The bonus is that I am starting to have the smooth shiny skin on my legs that I have always admired on other women.</li>
    <li> Use this for my upper lip. Yes it hurts and the pain hasn&#x27;t got better for me but it is quick and easy and beats waxing which is messy.</li>
    <li> This is the first epiglide that I have ever used or brought.  To be honest, this is a miracle product!!  However, using this product for the first time is very painful.  Remember to take ibuprofen or have a drink beforehand to help eliminate some of the pain.  However, after the initial use the pain is less severe and it gets less painful each time you use it.  It is definitely worth the pain!!  I also think using it in the shower or immediately after a shower causes less painful.  I would highly recommend this product.  I wish I would have known about this product years ago!!</li>
    <li> I have been using an epilator for over 2 years and liked the reviews on this. I understand epilating hurts but this was obscene. I barely got through 2 minutes and I couldn&#x27;t take it. I ordered the other brand I have been using and have been fine since. this is getting returned. Good seller, fast shipping but bad product!</li>
    <li> Have used a different type and cheaper than this one and this one does not do the job no matter how many times you go over the area.</li>
    <li> Painfull as all heck, but thats the nature of the game. Took a few tries to get the hang of it. I am not the biggest fan and will continue to use other hair removal methods also. I am 50/50 on if I would buy this again....</li>
    <li> I have never bought an Epilator but I really like this product.  The pain is minimal, compared to the fact, that it does remove hair better than standard electric razors.  I use it dry.  I would recommend this product.  Plus it is a Panasonic.</li>
    <li> love this product. Had a smaller version of it before and I thought that one was great but this 1 is amazing.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t actually used the full epilator (because its pretty painful the little bit I did use it)&lt;br /&gt;But, it moves really well.&lt;br /&gt;Its dummy proof. Any idiot could figure it out.&lt;br /&gt;Instructions are easy.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a 2 year warranty.&lt;br /&gt;Its panasonic which is good.&lt;br /&gt;Its a lavender color which is shimmery.&lt;br /&gt;Button works well.&lt;br /&gt;And I just use it as a regular shaver with the other piece which works nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money and I don&#x27;t think I ordered it through amazon, I think it was a different seller through amazon but don&#x27;t remember what seller but I got it in a few days only so the delivery was fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend!</li>
    <li> Love this epilator.  After reading the mixed reviews I was worried it would be very painful but it really isn&#x27;t.  I like the versatility of having the epilator head and the razor head.  When first using the epilator, make sure the hair is not too long (maybe shave with a blade and a few days later run the epilator).  If the hair is long, it can be painful.&lt;br /&gt;This epilator is great little tool.</li>
    <li> Got this after my other Panasonic epilator retired. It is perfect. The dual heads make a more efficient epilation. I didn&#x27;t adapt well doing it at the shower, i felt that the foam didn&#x27;t help and the water actually made the hairs stuck on the skin. Outside however, it is all I&#x27;ve ever asked for. The shaving head has a little grooming comb that works wonders. Overall I&#x27;m suggesting this one to all my friends!</li>
    <li> First time user. Good product. I will never go back to shave. It really works for me. For girls who never use this before may fell little pain, but I don&#x27;t think so for after first time.</li>
    <li> I have a love/hate relationship with this epilator. I have very dark, course hair and I have never used an epilator and only waxed a couple of times about 6 years ago. I read the reviews and decided to give it a try. Other reviews aren&#x27;t lying about the pain. I DO NOT recommend this, or any epilator if you have a very low pain tolerance. I can only do this in very small amounts. So I HATE the pain, but I do love the results. This epilator does exactly what it&#x27;s meant to. It pulls the hair right out from the root and if you do it properly, get every hair and leaves very little stubble. So it works great, but feels very masochistic.</li>
    <li> I was a little worried about ordering this product because of the reviews of how painful it would be. I&#x27;ve never used an epilator before and had tried waxing at home a couple of times (unsuccessfully because of the pain), but really wanted something that I could do at home so that I didn&#x27;t have to shave all the time. I decided to get it and it works great!  Yes, you will feel some discomfort but it really isn&#x27;t that bad.  I imagine if you have longer or thicker hair it may hurt more. I decided not to do the recommendations (taking pain pill before, ice your skin, soak in the tub, etc) but it may be helpful for beginners until you get use to it or your hairs are finer.</li>
    <li> I was very excited when I ordered this product because I hate having to shave every day to every other day since my hair grows back so fast and my husband has been complaining that I don&#x27;t shave enough (I like to go long spans of time and get really fuzzy haha) so first my best friend let me borrow her emjoi soft caress epilator *technically you are suggested not to share your epilators* and it worked really great, I only do my legs right now because I&#x27;m not brave enough to my armpits or bikini line (or more) and it can get pretty painful on the legs, my left leg is especially sensitive to the epilator but I&#x27;m getting used to it. I do have a bit of a problem with the hairs growing just under the skin so you can see them and it makes your leg look hairy but they can&#x27;t be epilated or shaved off. I&#x27;ve been exfoliating before and after epilation to try and prevent this and it seems to be working nicely, the other hairs that just wont come out I use a sewing needle on and pop it right out and attack it with my epilator. I&#x27;ve used it wet and dry and I haven&#x27;t noticed a quality difference but I do get more red bumps after when I use it dry so I prefer wet use. I also adore the shaver attachment. I took care of my bikini area with no problems with the shaver head and it was allot easier then using a regular razor. Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with this product, the only reason I rated it at 4 stars is because it can&#x27;t be used while charging. I understand it&#x27;s for safety reasons because I&#x27;m sure there would be someone along the line to try and use it plugged in in the shower so people without common sense ruin it for the rest of us. I hope my review is helpful to any of you debating on an epilator, I know it took me hours and hours to finally decide on this one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s as good as it promises. The clue if you don&#x27;t want to feel as tortured when epilating: Maintenance. Use it frequently instead of waiting until ALL the hair is long. I epilate my underarms, for example, every two days, and by doing so I just remove a few hairs every time and I don&#x27;t suffer at all!</li>
    <li> Epiglide does not remove all hair and leave bumps, shaver does not shave close, and very small head take long time to shave, not impressed should have gone with triple head shaver which shaves alot closer and faster</li>
    <li> I expected a lot of pain since it is my first time using epilators but this one did not hurt at all! So far I have only used it for my underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how it is cordless and very easy to use. Only bad thing is cleaning it up but you have to do that with any epilator and this is so much cheaper than going out and getting professionally waxed.&lt;br /&gt;Def recommend buying.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom on her birthday and I tried it out.  It&#x27;s a little weird at first but it has a good learning curve.  I plan on getting one for myself soon.</li>
    <li> This epilator is the best beauty investment I have made on myself in a very long time. I hate shaving. I always get razor burn, ingrown hairs, ect, even if I exfoliate, use the most expensive razors, and shave gels.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hurts a little. I have a pretty high pain tolerance but here are some tips I found handy.&lt;br /&gt;1. Always exfoliate before you epilate and the days after/between to prevent ingrown hairs. I already did this daily (dry brushing)&lt;br /&gt;2. Pull skin taught and don&#x27;t try to epilate hair that is much longer than 3 day stubble.&lt;br /&gt;3. I apply baby powder to epilated areas after I am done. For some reason this just makes the area feel nice a smooth and eliminates some of the irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who hates shaving.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my granddaughter.  She was apprehensive about  pain from it, but she was pleasantly surprised to find it not as painful as she had feared.  She is also pleased with the results when she uses it.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0021AFWXC Panasonic ES-WD51-P Epiglide Ladies Wet Dry Epilator, Pink]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i just love this epilator.its a very good investment compared to spending on waxing/hair removal creams.i just wanted to try this as it cost is resonable and also has a trimmer though i did not use it yet as i have it only for 3wks now.it cannot be used while charging....but the 40mins is more than enough for me.i even used it underarms also.first time it was very painful but second time it decreased...or may be i got used to it...or bcos of lesser density of hair.the lesser the no.of hair the lesser the pain.so i recommend to use it every 2 to 3 weeks and not wait till all the hair grows back and longer......:)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product for about a month and am still making up my mind. So far, it works very well, pulling out most of the hair (some of it breaks off). The battery life is good, and I like the bag it comes with. One thing that I don&#x27;t like so far is the fact that the number of ingrown hairs has increased significantly for me since starting to use the product. I hope to try different measures (like exfoliation) to take care of this issue. In the meantime, I&#x27;m pretty pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I knew prior to buying this product that epilating would be &amp;#34;uncomfortable.&amp;#34; However, I was not prepared for the pain at all. I started using the epilator on my legs, beginning at my ankle. I pulled ONE hair out, and had to call it quits for the day. Luckily, this epilator has a wet/dry capability, so I was able to use it in the shower, which was much less painful. You do get used to the pain after maybe 5 or 6 uses, but only if you use it consistently. If you stop epilating for any extended period of time, it hurts almost as bad as the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also epilate my armpits, which did cause a little bit of bleeding; however, I prefer epilating over shaving because of dark underarm hair. It makes my armpit look hairless, as opposed to always having a &amp;#34;five o&#x27;clock shadow&amp;#34; in my pits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product, but only to those who have a high pain tolerance.</li>
    <li> Beats shaving and hairs takes couple weeks to start growing back</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this epilator, but after giving it a try for several months, I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s just kind of a dud.  I had the Braun Silk-épil Xelle, and it worked very effectively - just about nothing left in its wake when used properly - but once the head lost its oomph and I couldn&#x27;t find a replacement part, I decided to try the Panasonic. While the Braun did a great job, it was rather painful in sensitive areas, so I figured I would give this one a whirl.  Positive: it doesn&#x27;t hurt. It is surprisingly gentle, in fact, and as someone who used to cringe and occasionally whimper when epilating sensitive areas, I was pleasantly surprised how gentle this really is.  Negative: why is it gentle? It only pulls about ever 4th hair.  You have to go over, and over, and OVER ever spot again and again, and still, if you have any finer hairs (even longer ones), it just doesn&#x27;t grab them. It does a good job on the coarser stuff, but the rest barely gets touched.  That alone is enough to recommend that you try something else, BUT! Even worse - there is a TERRIBLE design flaw.  The epilator DOESN&#x27;T WORK WHEN IT IS PLUGGED IN! Meaning, it has to be fully charged for you to get anything accomplished here. How many people keep a product you shouldn&#x27;t have to use more than once every 10 days or so (or longer) fully charged? How often do you remember 4 hours beforehand to plug the darn thing in?  Overall, I would recommend you try another product.  This one just isn&#x27;t very effective.</li>
    <li> I think I bought this product in 2011 and it is now 2015 and it is still going strong.  It works just as well wet as it does dry.  It keeps a charge even after all these years.  Only issue I ever had was that you cannot use it while it is plugged in so if it dies while you are epilating you will have to let it charge at least 15 minutes to use it again.  Regardless, a product that has been used regularly in and out of the shower for 4 years, has been dropped a million times and is STILL going strong deserves 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Overall this is a good product! Although I don&#x27;t have any other epilator to Compare this to, I can say it works 100% better than a regular razor You don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting yourself but you still have to deal With the pain of plucking. It does hurt and it will continue to hurt but it&#x27;s a pain You can get used to.armpits hurt the least.it doesn&#x27;t work well wet though. I chose this product because others on the Market of comparable price came with fewer tweezers(36) and I liked that it comes with a rechargeable  Battery and a neat pouch to store everything and travel with . I like it and I would recommend it</li>
    <li> I love this epilator.  I would recommend this item to any one currently using the emjoy epilator.  This epilator is  painless in comparison.  The charge time is only an hour and ever though I use my epilator two-three times a week (in the summer 2-3 times, once a week in the winter) it only needs charged once a week.  If you have never use an epilator there will be some discomfort for the first few times, but this one is gentler than most.  It is a great product, I have had mine for over 2 yrs. and still love it!</li>
    <li> My emjoi broke so I had to look around. Reviews on this sold me on it and I&#x27;m glad it did! It&#x27;s perfect. I can handle the pain fine on my legs and pits but was never able to do bikini area with my other one. Started with the beginner cap and after 10 minutes, was doing with no attachments. Very excited! This product also comes with a regular shaver head. Even better for me as my husband&#x27;s shaver broke. He used this on his facial hair and it worked great. So I really got a steal buying this one product! I don&#x27;t have any reason to use the wet feature so I can&#x27;t say anything on that. This epilator is the most gentle I think an epilator can get!</li>
    <li> First time epilators: Note that if you are prone to getting ingrown hairs, an epilator might not be the best method of hair removal for you. I did not have this problem, but after trying it on my friend she began getting MANY bumps on her legs (mostly the backs of her thighs) as the hairs began to grow. She has much drier skin than me - my skin is slightly oily, so that may be a culprit for the ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the pain: YES IT HURTS. Think of it as waxing but MUCH slower. Instead of the pain being a quick second or two, using an epilator is having the pain being spread over every single hair.. you can actually hear as the hairs are being pulled. However, this epilator has more &#x27;tweezers&#x27; than previous models (48 compared to 36) so it is noticeably faster to finish an area than other epilators. If you&#x27;re taking the dive for the first time I would recommend taking a pain pill about an hour before to lessen the pain somewhat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having owned this epilator for over a year, I can definitely say that it works as well as it did the first day. This is a great model that still holds enough charge to do both entire legs in one session after more than 50 charges. I find myself using the epilator about once a week on my legs, although the bikini area lasts me around 3 weeks of no hair growth. I love how the red blinker below the power button reminds you when the epilator has full charge and can be disconnected. A steady red light means it is still charging, while a blinking light means it is full. The travel pouch is great for storing the epilator and all the attachment as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wet/dry feature sounds attractive, although I did not find myself using it in the shower since it takes more passes for the epilator to pick up little hairs that get stuck to your skin with water. Also, if you are considering buying this for the additional shaving head, you will be dissapointed. Even immediately after shaving you can still feel the stubble as youwould a day after shaving with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this if you want an epilator that will last you a long time and will get the job done, but don&#x27;t expect anything good from the additional shaver head.</li>
    <li> I have used regular Epilady for years and took a chance on this because it was on a Daily Deal.  I really like it.  The battery lasts well and it is great for taking on vacation.</li>
    <li> K i bought this so that i wouldn&#x27;t have to pluck each individual hair which takes f#$^%%^ forever. Anyways like all epilators this HUUUUURRRRRRTTTTTT I mean it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s not gonna hurt ya know. But only the first time, after that your nerves in your hair get used to it and slowly diminish leaving it fast and painless. BTW i&#x27;m a guy and i&#x27;m not a homo or fruit or whateva, but I do, do this because I bodybuild, like when your flexing your biceps, I don&#x27;t think the ladies appreciate all dat hair hanging out. But best part about this is that its waterproof :) can do ums in da showa bah! make uhm dat less painless. Only ting is dat when I tried plucking down their, damn that might take me a while cuz shiz man dat hurt like a bagillion times more than my legs, underarms, and happy trail. But yeah great product, hope this helps, oh and comes wit a shaver and a beginner head which is smaller which in my case either you go big or waster your time. Be a WOMAN or MAN in my case! I mean you woman give birth for crying out loud. Hope this helps. :)</li>
    <li> a great deal and the quality you expect from Panasonic.It does what it says it will do and a whole lot more.</li>
    <li> Epilation review by a guy, normally I use eletric shavers for my facial hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I use some of the best shavers out there on the market, but no matter how clean I try to&lt;br /&gt;shave.  Shaving always left my skin a lightly grayish look(cause shavers can&#x27;t get to hairs deep under my skin), making my skin tone unbalanced after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to try out epilation for the very first time.  Well the result is great, but the experience&lt;br /&gt;was very unpleasant to say the least.  But It is more painful to do a man&#x27;s facial hair than legs or arms for example, facial skin is more sensitive &amp; the facial hair became much thicker &amp; stronger from often shaving.  Besides I did it raw on my&lt;br /&gt;first time,(something I don&#x27;t recommend for first timers)  meaning I didn&#x27;t use any epilation cream or spray that loosens the hair from the root making&lt;br /&gt;things easier &amp; less painful.  The only reason I did it raw is because of false video reviews on youtube saying how epilation doesn&#x27;t hurt much,  by the time&lt;br /&gt;the pain kicked in I was like man I don&#x27;t want to wait another week for the epilation cream to be delivered. To give you an idea of the pain, just use a tweezer&lt;br /&gt;pull a single hair from the area you want to epilate &amp; just multiply that by 2 or 3.  Who knows the pain might not be as bad, since everyone have different hair types.&lt;br /&gt;It was painful for me because my facial hair stick to my skin so well, (just hope the same goes for the hair on my head so I don&#x27;t go bald in the near future) &amp; mainly&lt;br /&gt;because I didn&#x27;t use any epilation cream.  It&#x27;s been 4 days since my first epilation,  &amp; the hair still haven&#x27;t grow back yet.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is still cleaner than shaving which is great.  From what I know hair will grow back thinner after epilation if you have thick hair, making future epilation less&lt;br /&gt;painful &amp; much easier as your body get use to the pain.  4 stars for the Panasonic ES-WD51-P Epiglide, I mean the device itself does what it should, which is pull hairs&lt;br /&gt; out of your body.  It also comes with a shaver head for shaving legs &amp; arms,( which I don&#x27;t use ) don&#x27;t know how good that is.  About 1 hour of charge time for 1 hour of use.</li>
    <li> I have been very disappointed with this product.  First, I have never waxed my legs but decided that I would try this with the hopes my legs would be smoother for longer.  How wrong I was, they never were smooth all I had was a lot of bumps and ingrown hairs.  After about a month they are starting to look normal again. I am not sure if I used this wrong but it is not the product for my legs.  I used it on my arms too, and though I did not have the same problems as my legs, it still seem to just give me the same results as shaving.  I believe my hairs where being broken off rather than plucked out.      I didn&#x27;t find this product painful to use but I have a high pain tolerance so I am not a good judge for that.  Other people have given this positive reviews so I am thinking my problem is user error i.e., not holding it correctly.  I won&#x27;t give up but it may end up in the garbage.</li>
    <li> First, the shipment was very fast and everything arrived perfectly intact.  Second, there have been very few things in my life that have caused more pain, including a double-ruptured appendix and eight days of sepsis before seeing a doctor, and a tailbone pilonidal cyst.  I am a guy with coarse hair and I started removing hair on my left leg, left arm, and partial stomach to get a gauge on how it would turn out.  I typically shave all this stuff with a razor in the shower at least every other day.  I used the gentle attachment, which gives a small buffer between the skin and tweezers, but it did not help me much.  The pain was excruciating, particularly on my stomach, and I ended up trying the beginner attachment to get a three-inch section of my stomach clear before I had to stop.  I checked different websites for tips on first-time epilating and used ibuprofen, baby powder, scrub pads, pulling the skin taut, etc, but I don&#x27;t think there is much help for someone with my type of hair.  Anyway, I finished my leg, which ended up looking pretty nice, though with a variety of red follicle dots on my shin.  My arm has been rough with red dots everywhere and the skin painful to the touch. I finished the major removal two days ago, and then a second pass yesterday, and again this morning. Each time caught some of the re-growth and broken hairs and the redness is starting to fade, though it is still noticeable by someone looking at my arm from several feet away.  I have scrubbed the epilated areas with a green scotch pad each day and that has helped loosen the budding ingrown hairs.  This is not for the faint of heart, but even with the issues I&#x27;ve experienced, I still have hopes that this will end up being less work overall than shaving.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a way to not shave and have your hair not grow back as fast, I would recommend this, or a at home laser hair removal system. This product doesn&#x27;t get all the hair, and you will usually have to go over the same area twice. And for some parts of my body, this really really hurts (plucking hair out is always gonna hurt). I recommend you use this product along with shaving. If you can&#x27;t stand pain, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend you getting this, you are better off with a at home laser hair removal system or shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you&#x27;ve waxed before, you should probably get this. My hair usually takes 2-3 times longer to grow back compared to shaving.</li>
    <li> the machine doesn&#x27;t work fast enough, it takes me much longer to delete the hairs , than when I used   my cheep old depilator, the nice thing is that it can be used in shower, but it doesn&#x27;t help it.</li>
    <li> One of the main features that made me buy this product was the double row of tweezers. I assumed that it would make this annoying task of hair removal much faster, but that was not the case. I have to slide it at the same spot over and over again until I get ride of all the hair. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is the first epilator that I&#x27;ve had and was expecting more on first use.  It took several tries to get my legs  looking good and seems likes the next time I looked more stubble was showing!  After keeping after it for about two weeks, it seems to have slowed and I&#x27;ve just taken a quick run twice weekly. Hair does seem finer that&#x27;s showing up now.  Expected more discomfort than there was, not bad at all. Each time has been less.  Used on underarms too and  was good with minimal discomfort.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review, but this product is so great I had to. It&#x27;s gentler than ones I&#x27;ve used before (Epilady brand). I found that the Epilady one left red marks when I&#x27;d do my legs, but this epilator takes the hair out without leaving red marks. If you&#x27;re new to epilators, it may hurt for several uses, but once your skin gets used to it this one isn&#x27;t that painful. One big plus is the bikini trimmer. I was expecting pain, but I couldn&#x27;t feel anything at all. It is perfect for trimming up the bikini line and getting rid of any unwanted hair all over the body. The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t pick up really short hairs, but I think the epilator itself is limited with length of hair. This is definitely a buy that you won&#x27;t regret!</li>
    <li> Grat product great price.Gets the job done fast and the pain is not unbearable.Fast charging time and great battery life.Good 2 year replacement warranty, quiet operation.great feature to be able to use it wet and be able to clean it after use.Very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I like how it can be used wet or dry, although i haven&#x27;t tried using it in the shower yet. the instructions on the package are really simple with illustrations, when i tried it on my underarms, it didn&#x27;t hurt like i expected (seeing too many videos of epilating on youtube) and it did the job well. it&#x27;s a plus that it has other covers or heads for shaving your bikini area, legs and arms and it has a cover for beginners. i also like how it came with a brush to clean it and you can easily take out the head to clean the tweezer area of the epilator. i can&#x27;t compare it to other epilators since this is my first one. so far, i like it. And my hair on my underarms grew thinner and it took more than 2 weeks for them to grow back. Not going back to tweezing again! or shaving!</li>
    <li> This epilator was a waste of my money, I paid almost $100 at an Ulta store, and for such price I expected a superb product. It worked fine the first three months, but then the speed and strength began to slow down and would not even last 20 minutes after having it fully charged for one hour. The package claims, forty minutes of cordless use after having charged it for one hour, this is a LIE!!!   I am TRULY DISADPOINTED at this product; I have shipped this product back to Panasonic with a letter of complaint. It has now been one month, and no one has even emailed me giving me an update or the status of my returned item. IT IS RIDICULOUS!   DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS EPILATOR!!!</li>
    <li> This does exactly as promised. It does hurt a bit more than waxing, but the savings from buying this product versus waking every 3 months is much more wise. Buy it, and be happy for a long time.</li>
    <li> My 4 year old phillips satinelle died and the current prices are too high for a satinelle, so I opted for the panasonic after reading reviews.  I like that it can be used wire-free. The wet use is a nice feature but somewhat impractical on areas such as armpits, as the foam from the bath gel makes it impossible to see the hair. I used the trimmer and was happy with it. Ditto for shaving head.  Easy to clean the lodged hair. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the epilator is slow, you have to go over the same area again to get it all smooth.</li>
    <li> It hurts, but if you want your armpits to be clearn, it is the best choice. For the first time, I spent three days on it inorder to let my skin have a rest. I&#x27;ll recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> I was swayed by the whole \\&quot;two rows\\&quot; of \\&quot;48\\&quot; tweezers. However, my previous (and sadly lost) epilator, Braun 5180, was much better at actually pulling out hair. After epilating for awhile, my hair becomes thin and fine and no matter how many times I run this epilator over it, it will not pull the fine hairs out like the Braun would. Instead it just pulls on them painfully without actually removing them. Even thicker hair requires several passes making the job that much slower.  Also, this unit has a really small sweet spot in that the tweezers only tweeze at the very tip of the head, meaning you have to be holding it perfectly perpendicular to your body in order to pull hair.  I&#x27;m super disappointed and wish I had just replaced the Braun 5180 I&#x27;d lost!</li>
    <li> It was my first time buying an epilator. I have been shaving and waxing in the past. I was kind of hesitant in the beginning due to horrible reviews regarding pain (read below regarding pain). ! I was debating between Philips HP6576/60 Satin Perfect Epilator and Panasonic ES-WD51. I am glad I made the right choice (Panasonic). I will list the factors that drove me to purchase this one! It&#x27;s not in the order of my preference.  1. Panasonic is $20+ cheaper. Although I wanted to buy from Amazon.com, it didn&#x27;t ship to Hawaii. I ended up buying mine at Soap.com, which came out to $53 with a first-time buyer discount. However, because I had to pay shipping to Hawaii, the total price came out about the same as Amazon.com. If you live in the mainland, buying at Soap.com might be cheaper with the discount. However, Amazon.com has a great customer service!  2. Waterproof. I really wanted something I could use in the shower, which I couldn&#x27;t with the Philips HP6576/60. I generally love things that are waterproof. I haven&#x27;t used it in the shower, but I can be assured that it won&#x27;t break if it touches water. Also, it&#x27;s easier to clean because it is waterproof.  3. Shaver/Bikini Trimmer. If you wanted to have this with the Philips model, you would have to go with the Philips Satin Perfect Deluxe, which costs about $134.99 on Amazon.com.  4. Beginner and normal epilating cap. Go with the beginner if it is your first time. Less painful because it uses less tweezers. However, it will take longer.  5. Small size. Great for travel. Pearly pink! It looks better than the pink on the picture! &#x3D;) &lt;3  6. Battery lasts a long time. I had it for about 3 months. I only had to charge it once! It&#x27;s super quick to charge as well.  BAD NEWS: I cannot say that its pain free. First time I epilated my underarm, it really, really hurt. I had pretty thick hairs, because I have been shaving for years. It also bled a little bit.  GOOD NEWS: Only after one epilation, my hair grew out thinly and it was barely noticeable. It feels great to know that your hairs won&#x27;t grow thicker and darker. Also, my skin is left soft! Also, there is no need for your underarm to look like chicken skin. I have also tried it in on my legs. I have really thin hair on my legs but it also works well on both thin and thick hairs. It also works well on bikini areas.  It&#x27;s an investment, but it is well worth it! I don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to shaving. I barely have to epilate, perhaps only once in 3 weeks. Also, because my hair grows thinnly, it doesn&#x27;t take long to epilate. Less than a minute on my underarms! :D I have to warn you that it doesn&#x27;t take out all the hair on your first stroke. The main reason for this (my opinion) is because our hair grows in different directions. Usually, I have to do several strokes depending on the hair growth.  Buy this one and see for yourself!</li>
    <li> I had an epilady for years, and was NOT able to use anywhere,  but or my face, too painful.&lt;br /&gt;I used this epilator soon after getting it, on my legs, and it was easier than shaving! It took me less time to do both legs than if I&#x27;d shaved one!  : )&lt;br /&gt;I would strongly recommend this product to anyone who wants to get rid of hair quite painlessly! It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this epilator since November of 2011. I tried using it on my legs once or twice but I stopped because it took so long to get all of the hairs and it just hurt too much -- which is to be expected when you&#x27;re ripping your hairs out. It&#x27;s not more painful than waxing, but the pain is just so prolonged that it&#x27;s not worth it. I just use Veet on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I really love this for armpits. I have fair skin and dark hair which makes for a bad combination for wearing tank tops - even if you&#x27;ve just shaved, you can still see a \\&quot;shadow\\&quot;. Using an epilator is less expensive than going to the salon to get your hair waxed but also less messy than at-home waxing kits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;* Fast&lt;br /&gt;* Not Messy&lt;br /&gt;* Inexpensive over the long run&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;* Hurts too much and takes to long to justifiably use on legs routinely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENDATIONS&lt;br /&gt;* Use over SMALL body areas: upper lip, armpits, toes, etc.&lt;br /&gt;* Use after showering, to reduce pain&lt;br /&gt;* Use DRY, so the epilator will actually grab the hairs better and rip them out&lt;br /&gt;* Use it FREQUENTLY. Don&#x27;t wait for all of your hair to grow back in the spot you&#x27;re epilating, or it will just hurt worse and take longer each time you do it. I do mine every 4-7 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope my review has helped. :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. you have to charge it before using it.  It&#x27;s great for the legs, but no so much for the rest of the body. It includes one shaver.</li>
    <li> I loved using this epilator. The ability to use it wet or dry is awesome. However, it died after a year of use. And there were a couple periods of time when I didn&#x27;t use it for several weeks, so I don&#x27;t think it was overused or anything. Since I bought it from a seller on ebay, panasonic won&#x27;t honor the 2 year warranty. Boo.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT. I am no longer standing in front of my mirror and plucking hair with my tweezer one by one. I was able to remove my underarm hair less than 5 minutes without much hurt. Go try it girls!</li>
    <li> Takes forever to do my legs, but if I do it frequently (every 5-7 days), it isn&#x27;t so bad. Definitely better than shaving.</li>
    <li> This works as expected and its good esp when you are in a hurry to go out ! Its good!</li>
    <li> Had different epilators before, this one is the best so far! Works for legs, arms, bikini. Equally good in wet and dry use.</li>
    <li> Man it hurts but boy does it remove hair at the follicle! I just wanna save money on buying wax- and if your a waxer like me you can handle the eplilation. It gets easier too the more you get used to it so hang in there!</li>
    <li> This is a great epilator. If this is the first time you are using one then I have found it is one of the more painless ones.  It has extra attachments which are handy and with one charge I have used it 4 times so far and it is still ready for more use.</li>
    <li> i enjoyed the shaver very much. the instructions could be written with abit more detail, but other than that, I&#x27;m liking the epilator.</li>
    <li> This epilator is fantastic. I didn&#x27;t order it from amazon, but wish I did b/c I paid $65 for it at drugstore.com. To the reviews that gave it low ratings for being painful - duh! What did you expect? It&#x27;s an electric tweezer! Of course it hurts! But after the first 1-2 sessions it hurts less and less, just keep up with it every other week or so and you will barely notice. I can go for 2 whole weeks without seeing hair growth. I recommend using it dry as my hairs tend to break off instead of pull out when I use it in the shower. Also, I recommend putting baby powder on your under arms so it won&#x27;t pinch the skin there. As with all beauty products - there are ups and downs, but like my mom always said - It hurts to be beautiful.</li>
    <li> Great Product for removing hair, just make sure to shave first.  Use it on bikini area, legs, and arm.  Tried it on the back of my neck but it hurt too much there.  Good product.</li>
    <li> 3.5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beloved Braun Silkepil epilator that I have had for about 8 years was beginning to sound like it was going to give up the ghost, so I started looking about for a replacement. Although - can you call something you have a love-hate relationship with beloved? More of a necessary evil. Anyway - this one was on sale, and had good reviews, so I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used this in dry mode, so I can&#x27;t comment on the wet. Also, I haven&#x27;t worked with electric shavers before, so I have nothing to compare to. I tried the shaver once, and it worked well for me.  The epilator works well too - I have used it on arms, legs and underarms. It feels less effective than my Braun, and I feel like I have to spend about 1.5 times more time on each area than I have to with the Braun (which is whining but still chugging along). I use both products without the protective caps since that makes it faster, and I&#x27;m ok with the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it&#x27;s wireless, but I wish it would also work when plugged in. It doesn&#x27;t - it changes when plugged in, and works only when not.  The charge lasts 30-40 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For optimal results, start with clean dry skin, and hair about 1/4 inch long. If I do it once a week, only a fraction of the hair has grown back, and it isn&#x27;t very long, so it&#x27;s not too painful. If I let it go for 2.5 weeks or more, I&#x27;m up to full hairiness, and it hurts more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an aside on waxing vs shaving vs epilation - I hate shaving.  IMO, waxing produces the best immediate results, but the time-between-waxes means going hairy for longer periods of time. Epilation is a good compromise.  Yet it hurts a bit, but you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a nutshell, I like this product for the price and the multiple features, but I&#x27;ll probably go back to Braun at some point.</li>
    <li> It was too painful  to continue  using!</li>
    <li> My first epilator! Where do I start? Of course it hurt! But days after using it I have hardly thought about it! I used this mainly on my bikini area (said to be the most painful). I was very confused at how to use it or how close it was supposed to be to the skin. I admit that the first day I used it the pain was too much and I did have to stop. I continued the next day and covered more ground but I did take frequent breaks. I will definitely say that if you are looking for a fast process just stick to waxing. I did shave within the week of my first use so the hair was pretty short in length. This is important because if the hair is too long it will just tug, rip and not pull from the root, leaving stubble and more pain. Anyway I epilated over the course of 3-4 days. I did this because of the pain and the area had a lot more hair follicles than I had anticipated. Also it did leave my skin very irritated and I had a handful of bloody spots. Nothing too bad or messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did use [[ASIN:B005FFNC2I Tend Skin Skin Solution 16oz \\&quot;Free Shipping\\&quot;]] after every use since I normally use it twice a day anyway. Since I&#x27;m african american this helped a lot with bumps since I get them no matter what hair removal technique I try! Its been over a week since epiating, and although I can feel very slight stubble, the area still lookS very hairless. I learned very quickly that you can get as close up to your skin as you feel comfortable. Moving the epilator up, down, back and forth also helps get all the hairs. Pulling the skin tight helps get hair and also minimizes pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did use in the shower and it did get my hair pretty well despite other reviews but I preferred doing it outside of the shower since I like to take breaks! I did try my arms and legs and quickly gave up. My arm hair is super fine and thin and doesnt bother me so I didnt bother with it much. My legs would just simply take FOREVER. I dont get razor bumps there so its not a good trade off. My underarms just hurt and again I don&#x27;t get razor bumps there so I just didn&#x27;t feel like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite thing about this product is that even though it takes a while to remove the hair, it lasts for a very long time! Least favorite is not being able to use while charging! Overall I would recommend this to anyone who gets razor bumps anywhere! This product will not necessarily prevent them but it will keep you from having to remove hair from that area as much giving you more time to prevent/get rid of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Sidenote* Also if you don&#x27;t use this in the shower be prepared for that awkward moment where you try to hover over a trash can to catch the hair or just get the vacuum ready hahaha!</li>
    <li> I have had this just for a few days and it works great.  This is my first time having an epliator and I love it!</li>
    <li> I must admit that I had serious misgivings about this item when I ordered it.  But with Amazon&#x27;s return policy, I took a chance and ordered it anyway.  Now that my wife has used it, she is quite pleased (and, therefore, so am I).  The thing really works, and it works very well.  It is much better than plucking, easier than waxing, and more feminine than shaving - a good purchase!</li>
    <li> love this epilator.. arrived quickly, appears sturdy and durable and comes in a cute lilac color.. i regularly epilate so the sensation/pain doesn&#x27;t bother me.. if you wax you should have no problems with epilating.. i use this on my underarms, arms, legs and anywhere else except the genital area.. haven&#x27;t tried it wet but when dry it does the job.. go try it, it&#x27;s worth your money versus pricey waxing at salons..</li>
    <li> I first turned it on and the noise was terrible! It scared me a lot but over all wasnt that loud. I tried the beginner cap and I thought well wtf this isn&#x27;t even getting any hair? So I put the gentle cap on and it worked much much better and wasn&#x27;t painful at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I decided to get this was because I got bored one day and started tweezing my legs and honestly it wasnt even bad at all and then I read about epilators and thought well if I can tweeze my legs I can use one of these, but all the reviews are what really scared me off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know other peoples pain tolerances are different but I&#x27;m 16 and this did not hurt me at all and I do not consider myself to have a high pain tolerance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had trouble with the back of my legs cause the hair grows in a weird direction but I just shaved that off with the shaver. I really love this and would recommend it to anyone who was looking to buy one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a great deal on it and once you get past the scary noise and reviews you can see its actually ok. I&#x27;ve only used it on my legs so far and it was fine.</li>
    <li> It works really well. I love it!</li>
    <li> Used it for the first time today, my arms are red and in pain but I can happily say im highly impressed:) After many years of going through multiple hair removal trial and error im confident this will be my new go-to! it&#x27;s quick, easy to clean, and my skin feels genuinely smooth and hair free, plus no harmful chemicals are always a plus to me since I have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator an I have never expected it working so well!!!  I have used it couple times after i got it, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt under the wet mode. I love it!</li>
    <li> This works great when my skin is nice and dry. It hurt a lot when I&#x27;ve used it the first time, but now that my hair has been growing thinner I&#x27;ve had absolutely no problems with it. My skin is not irritated and feels great. It doesn&#x27;t work good when the skin is wet but I really don&#x27;t mind that. I will def buy a second one just to have it.</li>
    <li> I love this. It does the job. I bought this because NO NO has such bad reviews &amp; costs so much. CRAZY just buy this</li>
    <li> The bad: It hurts to use it, but you sort of get used to it after a while. Also, it takes a long time to finish each leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good: It keeps my legs smooth for many days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind the pain, time, and effort to use it, it is a good product.</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator and I am very pleased. The epilator is efficient and not very painful. It&#x27;s amazing to see how much hair it plucks out. It is very easy to use and it works! If I shave before the initial session, and keep up with epilating regularly, it barely hurts at all. It helps to take a pain killer beforehand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included electric razor is also very high-quality and I am pleased with it. I tossed my old Cleo electric razor after I tried this one. I was surprised by how well it worked. I like having both razor and epilator in one item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motor charges quickly and runs for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The things I don&#x27;t like: the button that releases the razor/epilator attachment is placed where it is natural to grip the base. That means it&#x27;s easy to accidentally pop the base off while you are using it. Also, the epilator just does not work as well wet as it does dry. It also only epilates a small area at a time- next time I will get a unit with a wider head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall though my experience with this item is positive and I think it was a good buy. I got it on clearance at a local shop.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year and I&#x27;ve already started shopping for another one.&lt;br /&gt;Using it is very time-consuming and it managed to undo all the great work my previous epilator did. While about a year ago I had to do my legs once every week up to 10 days, my hairs are growing like crazy now and I have to use a needle to pull out the once that are having a hard time breaking through the skin. I did my legs the other day and they already look like the forehead of a grizzly. This is a fail. The only reason I kept on using it for such a long time is to break even on the money I spent on it. I rarely complain of anything but I had to write this review. Philips is the right brand.</li>
    <li> So far so goood...I got so tired of shaving and getting ingrown hairs, but I cannot afford to get laser hair removal. So I decided to get this product. First of all let me say, reading some of the reviews I was worried about the pain, but let me assure you, it hurts, some places more than others, but not like I imagined...it was not that bad. The first time I used it, I spread it out over a couple days so my skin didn&#x27;t get irritated, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  If you do not like to shave and get tired of ingrown hairs and cuts, then this product is definitely for you!</li>
    <li> This product is very useful but if you consider the price, it could be better.&lt;br /&gt;Because it has only one velocity, it can be painful using this in some areas.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the big thing for me was that it can be a shaver. But it doesn&#x27;t work that well.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is really good and the epilator head takes all the hair.&lt;br /&gt;So, my opnion? buy the other panasonic epilator because is cheaper, it has the shaving head, the trimmer but it has an additional velocity.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife in order to replace another, pricier product that quit after a little over 1 year of use.  This is an excellent design, well built and heavy duty.  It works very well and is easy to clean.  I can&#x27;t think of a single Panasonic product I have ever purchased that I wasn&#x27;t happy with, this one included.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to get the product. As long as I tested OMG!!!!!!! it hurts a lot!!!! But once again I knew it was too good to be true! It doesn&#x27;t take all the hair. So yo are left with few hairs removed and the rest are still there. BY NOW YOU LOOK LIKE A CHICKEN WITH NO SKIN AND MESSED UP RED SKIN WITH HAIR ON!!! I had hopes for this product but I guess it wasn&#x27;t that good to began with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am honest and I hope others can totally understand, the real results of this product!&lt;br /&gt;Have a great day!</li>
    <li> I hated shaving. Razor Bumps, ingrown hairs, stubble growth by the next morning, sometimes before the day is done.&lt;br /&gt;I started waxing but its extremely expensive at a salon and if I did it, I can&#x27;t reach every part of my body and it would be very time consuming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This epilator is amazing. It passed all my tests - Doesn&#x27;t pinch my skin no matter how hard I push it down. It DOES pull the hair out by the root and not break them off. It didn&#x27;t hurt as bad as I expected (my lower leg has been waxed countless times so epilating that was a piece of cake. My thigh on the other hand was a lot more painful but it worked out and I know it&#x27;ll only get easier the more I do it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish there were an easier way to clean it, and I don&#x27;t know how long it will last before dying on me but I&#x27;ll own an epilator every day from here on out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To avoid shavings constant stubble and waxwings expense and mess, this is a winner.</li>
    <li> Compared with this Braun epilator is good but not both, is a great gift idea if the woman does not have an epilator before or do not know the Braun hahaha.</li>
    <li> My friend told me about buying an epilator and how amazing it worked. I was dubious, especially after reading all the reviews of how painful it was. But after much research and deal shopping, I bought the Panasonic Epiglide wet/dry version. Warning to first-timers: make sure to use it on SHORT hair, not any longer than 1/4 inch. My first experience was rather addictive because it DOES do what it claims- pulls that hair right out, but for me, it also created red bumpy rashes in certain places until the next day. After the waves of pain subsided, I was happy see smooth legs and even bikini line. The effect lasted almost 2 weeks before I had to touch up, and my leg hair was even coming in thinner and lighter (I have dark, coarse hair). Yay! I&#x27;ve never gotten a professional wax, but after using the epilator I think I could handle anything!</li>
    <li> Loved the item and have stopped shaving/waxing thanks to this item. I love that it&#x27;s portable so I can take it into the shower when I&#x27;m in a hurry or wherever I need to be. I&#x27;ve had no problems with it. It comes with a small zip-up bag for easy travel. There are 48 tweezer heads, which is ok but if you&#x27;re looking for something faster/quicker, I&#x27;d suggest getting an epilator with more tweezer heads. Sometimes you might want more tweezer heads so you deal with less pain, in a shorter amount of time.</li>
    <li> Gift to my daughter &amp; she really likes it</li>
    <li> The best part of not having to shave everyday..I only use it once every two weeks and it takes about 15-20 minutes. After a while, you get used to slight discomfort..which is bearable for smooth hairless hands and legs for two weeks.</li>
    <li> I used it twice a month and i love this products. maybe it&#x27;s hurt at the first begining but it&#x27;s worth when u see the result.</li>
    <li> Ok so I tried using this as an epilator &amp; was unable to stand the pain. After a few subsequent attempts I realized it just wasn&#x27;t going to happen. However, I used it as a shaver &amp; it worked wonders! I was completely smooth everywhere I needed to be &amp; most importantly pain free! I will never attempt to use the epilator feature again but the shaver rocks!</li>
    <li> My previous epilator was one of the original Epilady models.  This is a lot quieter, less painful and more efficient.  I only wish I had bought it a long time ago.  Battery charge lasts a long time and recharges very quickly.</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife, because she hates shaving. She tried the product for about 2 months and had to stop due to the pain. I tried to use just to feel what she was experiencing and it was painful and it took skin because I pushed too hard. If you like the pain this product is for you, if not, you may want to search other options.</li>
    <li> I read other reviews and was still not prepared for the pain.  I tried numbing cream &amp; Hurricaine Spray and finally came to the conclusion that nothing will numb my bikini area and legs like I want it to.  But remember, you are jerking your hair out by the roots...in large quantities at a time.  Hurricaine Spray worked great for numbing my underarms.  And I am convinced that nothing in this world will make your underarms smoother than an epilator.  Since this epilator is a wet/dry model, I finally gave up trying to suffer through it with numbing agents and took it into the shower.  I was able to tolerate it much better (whether the hair came out easier because my pores were dilated from the hot water or I was just more relaxed, I could not tell you).  After a couple of weeks of using it in the shower, I am now able to do it dry without a lot of pain (at least on my legs and underarms).  I found that even in the shower, I was moving the epilator so fast (because it hurt so badly) that I was missing a lot of hairs, but eventually was able to get all areas completed.  I also noticed that my leg hair grows in all different directions, so I can&#x27;t just run the epilator straight up and expect it to get everything.  I highly recommend using the &amp;#34;starter&amp;#34; shield (covers up all but about 3 of the tweezers) for the bikini area as this makes it much more tolerable.  Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty convinced after way too much research that epilators only work for some types of hair. It does pull out some of the hairs on my legs, but some it just pulls but nothing comes out, and others it just leaves for some random reason. I can go over my legs 100 times and they will not be hair free. The worst is when it pulls and breaks, which happens and I don&#x27;t know how to avoid it. I&#x27;ve tried dry and wet and think wet is less painful and dry works better. I epilate then shave the next morning and do this every few days.</li>
    <li> I read tons of reviews about epilators before I decided to buy one. I was worried that it would be too painful or too loud (I live in a dorm), but I decided to take the chance and get it anyway. I&#x27;m very happy that I took the chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This epilator is great for many reasons. The portability is useful for me since I like to shave and epilate in the shower (it hurts less with warm water and soap, anyway). It may not be the quietest,  but it&#x27;s definitely not as loud as some people say it is. It isn&#x27;t as painful as some reviewers say it is (although it may be different person to person). But ultimately, the thing that I have found most useful about the epilator is that it has a shaving attachment. Thanks to that, my boyfriend and I can share the epilator. He uses the shaving attachment for his facial hair and I use the epilator attachment for my body hair. In between uses, we wash it and charge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onto the pain of the epilator, since it&#x27;s a key part of whether most people will decide to buy it. The first time you epilate, especially if you have never plucked a hair before, is very painful. Your sensitive areas (like underarms) can bleed. Mine certainly did. However, I have noticed that if you use the epilator in the shower with shower gel or body wash, the process is much less painful and leaves your skin less irritated. My best advice for first-time users is to use it in the shower. You may still bleed if you epilate your underarms, but after the first time of using it, I doubt you will want to go back to shaving. I noticed that my underarm and leg hair both became finer after using the epilator for a few weeks. It also takes longer to come back and doesn&#x27;t leave ingrown hairs like shaving and plucking tends to.</li>
    <li> 1 hour charging works for only 40 minutes but the last 10 minutes it&#x27;s dying.... Epilator has very soft sound, it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. I just expected the huge power of operating but it&#x27;s not so powerful as I expected.</li>
    <li> I have been waxing my legs for 20 years. I thought I should give this machine a try: the worst experience! I never had so many ingrown hairs, bumps and awful infections on my legs like this in 20 years. Never thought this machine could be so damaging on my skin. Of course, I returned it but I still had to return the fee for the label.&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and save your money: do not buy this.</li>
    <li> I bought this product as an alternative to waxing.  I love the results of a full Brazilian wax, but I do not love the pain or paying $50 each month.  This is my first epilator ever, so I have nothing else to compare this product to.  It takes some practice to maneuver the epilator around all the curves of the nether region, but once you figure it out it gets easier.  Yes it is painful, but I prefer using the epilator over waxing as I can control what is happening and take a break if I would like.  Make sure you pull the skin as taut as possible to lessen pain and to get the hairs removed by the root.  After a while, I decided to remove the cap completely so that I could grab more hairs and see more of what I was doing.  For the more sensitive labia, I would recommend taking the cap off and barely letting the epilator touch the hairs.  This will prevent pinching of the skin and just removal of hair. I waited a week to epilate down there again, although it was still pretty smooth :)  The second time epilating was much faster and less painful as 1. I had already removed most hair the week before 2. I already knew what to expect.  I tried it on the legs and it felt more uncomfortable to me than my private area, go figure.  I haven&#x27;t tried the razor feature.  The battery life is pretty good, it lasted over an hour straight.  I am very happy I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased this epilator in August 2013 and I can’t return it.  I gave it so many chances but so unsatisfied. I read the instructions several times and tried and tried.&lt;br /&gt;My problem with this product:&lt;br /&gt;I had to use it three to four times a week.  But then I shaved at least three times per week.&lt;br /&gt;With this product you can’t get all the hairs from your leg.  The length of hair is explained it the instruction.  I guess my leg hair has an inconsistent growth.&lt;br /&gt;Each time I used it my legs had redness from the hairs that were removed. I got aloe vera gel and it gave me some relief.  But the redness was still there and then I got ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Wish it was what they said but it isn’t. I’m tossing it in the trash!!!&lt;br /&gt;I wish Amazon would consider a six-month return policy on items like this!</li>
    <li> I have used a Braun epilator for over a year that I purchased on Amazon. I love it. But the tweezers were beginning to seem dull. I looked for a replacement head but could not find one. So, I decided to try this one. I like it because it is cordless and you can use it wet or dry. It seems like you have to go over the area many times though to get all the hair removed. I do use this on my pubic area as well and love the softness you achieve from epilating. I still have to use the braun in the small areas and curves though. It is great for underarms and legs! I will continue to use it. But eventually will get a new braun. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I am extremely happy with it. For the last 15 years or so I have been using an old Epilady&#x27;s epilator with the coil. I was happy with that one too, but it was so old that it finally felt apart. I decided to go with Panasonic&#x27;s model since it was cheaper than Epilady&#x27;s, it received good reviews, and it qualified for free shipping. I do not regret it. The new epilator is much faster than the old one, epilation hurts much less (I use it only for legs), and I love the fact that it is cordless. I should have bought it years earlier. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> i bought this product after my philips epilator got broke after 3 years or service. i was quite scared to buy the product but when i used it for the 1st time, it was amazing. it gives wax effect. leaves skin so smooth and it irritates, itches very less (Compare to my last one). my last epilator used to leave my skin reddish, spotted and so much itchy if i use it after a long time and used to left hair at some places. when i used this epilator after 2 months of break, it removed hair very smoothly, without irritation. i will highly recommend this product to my sister and friends. a must buy product to save time and skin. :)</li>
    <li> This epilator gets the job done with very little discomfort. Where other epilators I tried used to tug and hurt, this one glides over hair easy and pulls out fast and almost painless. The more I use it the less hair I have in the treated area. I can also go around ten days between use and don&#x27;t look like a hairy chimpanzee.</li>
    <li> Actually, my mother loves it. The superior ratings were accurate. By far, this is the best &amp;#34;bang for the buck.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I was looking for an alternative to shaving and couldn&#x27;t afford regular waxing -- so I did quite a bit of research and settled on this epilator by Panasonic. I&#x27;ve been extremely happy with this epilator. It&#x27;s great to have the wet/dry option so you never have to worry about water damage. The battery lasts quite a while and it charges quickly. Pretty easy to clean (can&#x27;t quite get all the hairs out but they&#x27;re certainly no bacteria growing in there thanks to the sturdy brush that&#x27;s included. I don&#x27;t have a way to compare this to other epilators, but it was a great first time purchase. I even got one for a good friend over Christmas and it&#x27;s worked really well for her too. I think anyone can be confident that this is a good epilator... but be warned, epilating isn&#x27;t for everyone (varying pain tolerances, hair types etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I recently tried the shaving attachment for the first time, and it&#x27;s fantastic! I bought this gadget to avoid shaving but the razor makes it very tempting... no razor burn!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item in less than 2 months ago.  For the first month, it was working fine, but all of a sudden, the device stopped working.  I would plug it in and it would work for a few seconds and then stop.  When I tried plugging the device in some of the outlets, it wouldn&#x27;t work at all and now I can&#x27;t even return it.</li>
    <li> I love my Panasonic epilator. It is hassle free and the least painful epilator I have ever used. It can be used both in wet and dry conditions. It is total value for money product.</li>
    <li> i had to write a review about it because it is better than it looks.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with different set ups for your epilator, it pulls hair great, and the most important (to me) it can be used under water.</li>
    <li> This product exceeded my expectations--I am very happy with it. I like that there is both an epilator and shaver capability.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my spouse, she liked and says it works smoothly and less pain than the others she used, she is so happy with it.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd epilator my wife has tried and She just loves it. The first one was Barun, which she returned it and never used an epilator for 2 years. With this she is extremely happy!</li>
    <li> The product was as described.  I like that it is quieter than others I tried.  Only issue that I have is that the top comes off every so often.</li>
    <li> I will recomend this product to everyone. Price is affordable design and stile 5 stars :) (it&#x27;s important to me..) and painless.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s simply working great and it hurts lesser than waxing takes less time also.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to carry and easy to use and saves lot of time.</li>
    <li> This was returned. I cant believe how much this item hurts. I have to say...I did expect pain but this is crazy. I had to use it everyday or every few days for all the stray hairs. I had constant bumps in my legs and the hair never seemed to be completely gone. It was always stubbly. Not smooth like shaving. Bikini area isn&#x27;t the worst...I think ankles hurt the most. I do agree with the other posters...it feels like razor blades on your skin. I guess if you like epilators and can deal with the pain...this item is very good. It is packaged very nicely with a travel case and the cover for beginners. It has a razor attachment but it didnt seem to work. The Epilator itself is very pretty and charges so quickly. It is wet and dry so using it in the shower was great. I would recommend it for anyone who wants a very good epilator. It does seem to be high quality. I woudln&#x27;t recommend it to anyone who expects a moderate to low pain from an epilator. I would recommend trying a regular razors or perhaps hair removing creams.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this epilator!!! I have been using a cheaper one for about a month.  I just received this one today and HOLY WOW is there ever a difference!  All epilators are NOT created equal!  The Panasonic is so sleek and it operates very smoothly!  I seriously doubt I will ever shave my legs agian!</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT Epilator. I bought another epilator at Target and it wouldn&#x27;t charge! So I took it back and went with this Panasonic that my mom already has. I am so glad I made the switch. It works great and doesn&#x27;t hurt. I still want to try using it with Gels/water for more comfort. I recommend getting some gold bond powder or something to apply to your under arms, legs, or wherever you are epilating. It always for smooth strokes above the skin and will keep your skin from rubbing off (which happened to me when I first used it). The attachments are awesome and it comes in a nice sturdy case with a zipper. The other Epilator only came with a little bag with strings to close it. This is definitely nicer and was a better price too! :) Definitely recommend buying this Epilator. My hair grows back really fine and thin, way better than shaving.</li>
    <li> I love my epilator and have had it for more than a year now.  I do wish that I bought the one with a higher speed. It works well though.  I think a higher speed would pull out the hair quicker.</li>
    <li> I bought the epilator while looking for an electric razor.  I had my doubts but have been extremely happy with the results I have gotten.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> good product and removes hair well. i would recommend it. easy to use . but it should cost a bit less.</li>
    <li> I have used the Braun epitady in the past and it was far superior. This takes far longer, doesn&#x27;t grip around curves as well and feels clunky</li>
    <li> Hair removal is quite painful, and epilation is no exception. I usually wax and I got used to it- but apparently many ladies feel epilation it is very painful.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my wife.  Here is what she says about it:&lt;br /&gt;Great battery life.  Nice close shave.  Having the option for 2 different epilator settings is nice.  The case is nice.  It is very compact making it easy for travel.</li>
    <li> Just received it last night.  So I charged it for about 1.5 hours (recommended 1 hr).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When trying it out, I was a little worried, because not sure if it would hurts.  But it really works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking through different brand, but finally selected this one, because Panasonic is a big brand for home product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works very well.  Just love it.</li>
    <li> I am a long time epilator user.  I used a Braun epilator for the past 10 years, decided it was time to upgrade to a new one since the Braun wasn&#x27;t picking up all the hair on my legs.  There was really one thing I really wanted in a new epilator: cordless function.  The Braun one was not cordless, therefore required traveling with the adaptor.  It&#x27;s a hassle to have to pack the epilator and a charger, not to mention having to plug in every time I use it meant that it also restricted where I can use the epilator in the hotel room.  This panasonic epilator is indeed cordless, and for short trips, I won&#x27;t need to pack the adaptor with me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also pretty cool that it accepts a wide range of voltage, since that means I can take this with me to Asia or Europe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some users complained about the pain, but for me, I got used to using the epilator and now it&#x27;s not even painful.  I have thick, dark hair that grows fast- great for my hair on my head, not for the body.  When I shave, stubbles are noticeable by next day.  So I like to use the epilator- I can achieve hairless legs for 3 days before I feel the stubbles on my legs.  Compared to waxing, it&#x27;s mess-free and it&#x27;s cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great and everything, but I gave it a 4 star instead of 5, because you can&#x27;t use the epilator when it&#x27;s being charged.  I once forgot to charge it and had to wait a while before I can use it again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not irritating the skin which is good but I wish it will give a more cleaner shave, otherwise I will give 5 stars</li>
    <li> If you have any doubt in your mind about this product, just take the chance and buy it. I absolutely love my epilator. I always thought shaving was a huge pain in the butt, but now I can get my legs super smooth (without drying them out from the act of shaving constantly)&lt;br /&gt;yes, it hurts a little, but it&#x27;s so worth it. Your hair will grow back thinner and you will only have to epilate once a week or so (compare that to shaving every day) and the shaver head included is perfect for painless removal of armpit and pubic hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommended this product to some of my friends and they loved it too!</li>
    <li> The product is OK overall but the trimmer is pretty bad. It&#x27;s never been sharp enough and hardly useful. What I don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t work off of the power cord. You need to wait until the battery is charged before using it again. Why?</li>
    <li> This product is not a good alternative to shaving or waxing. It&#x27;s extremely time consuming and not effective at removing hair. After hours spent using the device I never had even an inch of smooth skin. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great epilator that is able to get every single hair so I don&#x27;t have to go back and pluck or shave. However, my hair is thin so I do have to be patient when epilating my legs. It works much better wet with soap than using it dry. I have seen some ingrowns, but that&#x27;s to be expected with any epilator without exfoliation after. Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time. Its really great</li>
    <li> Great epilator ever. Let me count the ways. I&#x27;ve tried a few and this is the best. I found it for an obscene bargain of a price.    This works awesome. I&#x27;m pretty brave and I&#x27;ve waxed before so I figured I could handle this and it can be used all around. I bought a pricy waxing kit that is not another expensive box to throw out. It was messy, ineffective and brutally painful. This was so easy to use.    Things I love:  - Charge time is ridiculously short. I almost didn&#x27;t believe it so I charged it longer the first time but its literally only an hour and this puppy is good to go. I used mine at least 1 hour on 1 cyle over a span of a week and it was still good. The others had 8 hour cycles and still didn&#x27;t last as long as this.    -  Underarms looks awesome. Sure I thought I was going to die the very first time I used it but its winter and I had probably let the hair get too long. However, 3 days later I was still smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom instead of the usual black shadow the following day and ingrown hairs shaving would give me. I don&#x27;t have a single ingrown and now I just run a quick pass every other day to catch any that grows up and its nothing. I didn&#x27;t use any of the head attachments. Worked so great without them.    - Bikini / Brazilian Ok warning. If you don&#x27;t have a high threshold for pain stay away and just use the kinder shaver head. Consider the premise. Your tweezing hair from the root from a super sensitive area. Advice: Shave first and give it 2 days or so this way hair isn&#x27;t too long but grabbable. Pop a few advil. Beforehand make sure you have taken a hot shower prior and dried up or since this is wet dry you can attempt it in the shower. Be careful around the lip area because if your not steady then just imagine the consequences.  However, once you get it done once maintenance isn&#x27;t too bad and the duration needed between is a million times better then shaving which would give me horrific ingrown hairs. I didn&#x27;t use any of the head attachments. Worked so great without them. I did put it on for the very very close to scary zone area.    - Legs Oh yes I&#x27;m loving this. Relatively smooth again after 2 days. Again like the other areas a quick pass every other day to stay smooth and its nothing. Again didn&#x27;t even need any of the gentle or beginner attachments.    Upper lip- I tried it there with the gentle attachment. It worked you just need to get used to where the pluckers are.    Shaver option- Awesome this way you have a backup plan for super sensitive areas but I can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love how infrequently I need to now do hair removable and how smooth it is.    Things I don&#x27;t like  - Nothing device wise. I can&#x27;t knock this unit. Yes its painful but its crazy effective. This isn&#x27;t for wimps but this device is one of the kindest of its species. The epilady one I had felt 10x worse and didn&#x27;t even get the short hairs. And once you get on a regiment its nothing.    NOTES: You do not need to use this plugged in. Freedom baby.</li>
    <li> I was tired of shaving my legs every other day and heard a few YouTube Beauty Gurus raving over their epilators. Although I heard it was painful, a few of the Gurus said epilating reduces those hair spots on your legs and eliminates dark underarms! But alas, I used the Panasonic epilator for a year and 7 months and...was disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On legs: I hate the spots on my legs. I have dark brown hair and tan skin, and no matter how many blades my razor has or how well I exfoliate, I still end up with those dark spots. With the epilator, I had to go over spots at least 5 times before all the hair was gone. I tried to epilate at different hair lengths, but every time was the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On underarms: The epilator worked better here (perhaps because the hair was thicker), but I found myself epilating almost every day to stay hairless. It didn&#x27;t stop the hair from growing, but the hair didn&#x27;t grow back all at once either. Did epilating for almost two years help with my underarm darkness? Eh...not really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After almost 2 years of use, it suddenly stopped working. Would I buy another epilator? No. The basic concept was obtained with this one and it obviously didn&#x27;t work wonders, so it&#x27;s back to shaving for me.</li>
    <li> This thing works like a champ. It most definately removes the hair, takes a couple of passes, but they come out. Don&#x27;t buy this if you have a low pain threshold. Imagine a group of tiny midgets with pliers yanking your hairs out one by one. That&#x27;s how it feels. Legs are basically pain free, arms more painful, chest and armpits are impossible. I can indure some pain, I tried this sober, and after a chat with El Capitano, still no dice for armpits and chest. It does seem to get easier with time, as in, it won&#x27;t hurt as much, but I&#x27;m just sticking to legs and arms for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. you&#x27;re gonna want to trim your hair down to size, if you try it with half inch long hair, it&#x27;ll take you forever, cut your hair short before you use this, you&#x27;ll save yourself a ton of time.</li>
    <li> So I bought this and left it in the box for a long time after using it the first time because it kind of hurt and I was being a wimp that day.  I have now been using it for about 5 months and I love it. My favorite place to use it is on my arm pits, it took all the hair out and I love not having to shave every single day. You just look there every few days to see if there are any new little hair and then use it again.  If you can get past the first little bit of pain, the more you use it the less it will hurt because it only hurts when it is pulling a lot of hairs at once.</li>
    <li> I really haven&#x27;t had time to really get used to this, but so far, it seems like it takes a long time to get the hair off your legs, and so far, I can&#x27;t get it to get the hair at all under my arms.  Also, if I had realized you couldn&#x27;t use it on your chin and upper lip, I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it at all.</li>
    <li> Had it a little over a year, and doesn&#x27;t keep a charge anymore.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t pull all the hairs, it cut a lot of them and didn&#x27;t leave my legs looking or feeling smooth, I am a waxer and I was hoping I could use this in between, but I prefer waxing to this as this did not leave my legs looking or feeling smooth and hair free</li>
    <li> since this is my 1st ( &amp; last) epilator I can only state that it was very painful to use.  It didn&#x27;t seem to grab the really fine hair and the course hair I can pull myself  with much less pain.  I will stick to waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use this any more</li>
    <li> I love it. So easy to use and it does a great job. I&#x27;m very happy I bought it and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This epilator is not as effective as the ones from Phillips, which I always used before. I decided to try this one because it has more tweezers, but apparently, more tweezers doesn&#x27;t mean hair removed faster... The other bad thing about this epilator is that it does not work plugged in, so if the battery runs out, you must wait until it is charged again to use it.</li>
    <li> This epilator works well however it is not for the weak.  After using it for several months on facial areas and legs, I think it does an ok job.  It hurts on the face, but I have become somewhat used to it but on my legs, ouch.  My legs will sting for almost a half hour afterward.  I can&#x27;t say that the hair does not come back as quickly as with tweezing, but it gets it done a lot faster.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not new to epilators: I owned several epilators over last 12 years and each next one was always step up from previous. Last one i owned was braun silk epic that i bought here on Amazon about 8 years ago. it still works fine, but i wanted to find something to upgrade: possibly time saving and cordless feature i think is a plus. I was looking into dual rotating tweezing discs: Emjoi dual disc, but it was  double the price then this one and they even don&#x27;t include a shaver attachment, which i do like to use sometimes as a trimmer. then iVog X-Tweez Dual Opposed disc was not expensive but had bad reviews. They both claim to have 72 tweezers vs 48 of this one. But when i saw this epilator on Groupon 3 day deal for $23 cheaper then on amazon, decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m glad i did. Excellent purchase! I can&#x27;t say how it will be long term: only used it once, but it&#x27;s definitely does the job in half the time plus it&#x27;s super quiet oppose to my old ones that made noise like big machine guns,  and even i can say that pain wasn&#x27;t an issue in any of my previous models, as my skin is adjusted to it afer so many years of epilating, but this one absolutely painless! and i always take the guard off as it give you better job in faster time if I just use it with discs closer to your skin. But of course it&#x27;s not recommended to do if you&#x27;re new to epilators. I use it under arms, bikini area and legs, and this one does all of the area in about 15-20 min. I don&#x27;t think that wet/dry feature is very useful for using it as epilator, maybe with the shaver attachment. In my experience epilating is best to do on dry skin and figured out how stretch my skin in underarm and bikini area, so you don&#x27;t get pinched, but still every now and then my old ones would pinch my skin. No pinching with this epilator! Now i hope this one would last me for years like my other ones i owned.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm.  I don&#x27;t use it wet but i love the cordless feature.  I would recommend to anyone.  This is great if you don&#x27;t shave.</li>
    <li> the RPM is just not high enough. using it is painful the shaver part is useless. I can&#x27;t recommend. My old product worked much better.</li>
    <li> This is my first time to ever leave a review but I feel it&#x27;s deserving. About a month ago my Braun silk bit the dust after around 4 yrs of use. It was my first epilator. I knew it would feel uncomfortable but considering you don&#x27;t have to shave often it was worth it to me so I just accepted some issues I wasn&#x27;t totally happy about. I wanted to take time to research newer epilators before I bought a new one. I&#x27;ve heard Braun was the best brand but I was still keeping my options open. After a long week of researching I committed to this Panasonic &amp; so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;In comparison:&lt;br /&gt;All the little hairs that get left growing under my skin no longer exist with the Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;The redness &amp; skin blotches doesn&#x27;t exist&lt;br /&gt;The discomfort is at a very minimum to none&lt;br /&gt;The time to finish my legs is cut in half&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t get hot &amp; needs to cool down&lt;br /&gt;It leaves your skin smooth for weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Much easier to remove heads to clean&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t even have to use the attachment to make less painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned about the battery life because I have limited use of my hands which makes me take longer than normal but it kept a charge till I was finished with everything on me, top to bottom. By the way it works great on all body parts with hardly any discomfort. The regular shaver part is also really good. I think it could take on any length of hair &amp; texture without skipping a beat. I totally recommend this product for a beginner or a pro.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using an epilator, so I have nothing else to compare this model to. But epilating, especially under the arms, is extremely painful. I&#x27;m scared to try any other brand, to invest in something that hurts that much. But I do like the electric razor part.</li>
    <li> Shipping was insanely fast and it works great. its just extremely painful if ur not use to it. I have black coarse hair and i have to shave non-stop and it gets tiring. i would recommended this to anyone that has the same problem as i do. So if ur looking to shave a lot less i would buy it if i were u.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using epilators for the last 8 years and have only owned those of the Braun brand. I was drawn to this model because it has 42 tweezers so I figured it would be faster and I wanted the accessories (cleaning brush, pouch, etc.). This epilator is the least painful one I&#x27;ve ever used, which is obviously a pro! I do also believe it is faster, and I like that it is cordless so I&#x27;m not stuck standing in one spot in my bathroom. The dual head is somewhat awkward on curved areas, but you can easily adjust the angle to make it work. I&#x27;ve used it everywhere, and the pain factor prompted me to try using it on my face for the first time. Note that that the manufacturer does not recommend using this epilator on your face. That being said, I was very pleased with the results for cheeks and sideburns and found it to be quicker than waxing and no more painful - possibly even less painful. Added bonus is that I can do it myself with better results than I&#x27;ve had with self waxing. I would definitely recommend this product to others, especially if you want to reduce the amount of time and pain (literally) spent epilating.</li>
    <li> This is the second epilator I&#x27;ve tried. If you&#x27;re new to epilators this is a good fit.&lt;br /&gt;Pro: It hurts a little less than the one I bought before. Quick charge time, let&#x27;s you know by a blinking light when it&#x27;s ready. Holds a charge for at least a half hour of use. Good fit for your hand. The flexible head is really great. I use it almost exclusively as a dry epilator, though the shaver head and wet option are cool I haven&#x27;t had much use for them. Pretty quiet.&lt;br /&gt;Con: I think it&#x27;s not as powerful as my old one, which I could use when it was plugged in for an extra oomph. If you&#x27;re not used to epillating then do realize this is not a fast process. This exact product doesn&#x27;t seem to take longer than my last one but it doesn&#x27;t improve on the time I spend on my legs. Does not offer an exfoliating scrubber which is a NECESSITY if you are using this or any other epilator.&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I would recommend this to a friend. It&#x27;s a good buy.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re new to the epilating world try this one. Remember you will need at least a half hour for both legs. And once you&#x27;ve done the first few weeks you need only do about once a week to keep your legs looking super fine. I did two or three times a week for the first couple weeks and now (two years later) I would never go back to shaving!</li>
    <li> I like this product because of its versatility. Word of warning, it does hurt! You might have to muster up the courage to continue on after you started like me, but once you are done you will feel like you can handle anything that comes your way haha. I only gave the product 4 stars, because I wish the shaver setting got closer - could just be me, but I can never seem to get as close as I would using a razor.</li>
    <li> Second one I bought because the first one wore out!! Skin smooth as a baby! After several uses on underarms you will never go back to shaving.</li>
    <li> This did nothing for me. I got it for my chin hair/stubble and turns out it doesn&#x27;t do that. It just rolls around the skin pulling nothing out. It also hurts when I use it on my legs. My legs are somewhat sensitive to it and the hair grows longer, so that might be why but I couldn&#x27;t sit through a session even biting my tongue. Im not giving up on it though, it&#x27;s a pretty little thing and it&#x27;s not cheap. I&#x27;ll try to use again some day.</li>
    <li> i bought this based on the good reviews, this is NOT  good product, spend a little more and get something that will actually pluck out coarse hair. i used this mostly for my arms and underarms, i got so frustrated with it that i just went back to the razor. emjoi costs a little more but its a MUCH better epilator</li>
    <li> Works great and keeps its charge for weeks even with daily use. Rechargeable and comes with a cord charger. Love the wireless wet/dry feature and love that I am able to change out the head covers for smaller or larger areas. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is my second epilator. It works great. Yes, it does hurt. I use it below my knees. It hurts a lot above the knees. On the first run it misses some hair. I go back to it the next day and it gets all the remaining hair.</li>
    <li> Received quick and works great! I have been using a few weeks but definitely recommend this! Would buy again in the future if needed!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an old epilator.  I have been epilating for well over 15 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For beginners, I think it is great. It is very gentle, quiet, and cordless which is convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately,as a very long time user of epilators the most important thing for me is speed.  I don&#x27;t care if it hurts more, I want to be done quickly.  I thought with double the tweezers compared to my old one it would be faster.  It is not faster and may even be slower. You have to go over and over an area to get all the hair. It seems that they have made this so safe (I don&#x27;t think you could get pinched by this if you tried) that its efficiency is seriously impaired.  It is difficult to do bikini lines since it can&#x27;t grab the hairs because of the safely cover.  Frustrating.  To speed things up on my legs I sometimes take off the safety cover.  It&#x27;s faster, but be careful - it looks like it could take a big chunk out of you if you aren&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ability to use it wet is not useful to me. I can&#x27;t imagine using this in the shower; a 45 minute shower would kill my skin!  Also I found that while rinsing out the head sounded like a quick and easy thing, it led to a head that wouldn&#x27;t dry for days, so I couldn&#x27;t put it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the attachments are useless to me.  I use the epilator on everything: legs, pits, and occasionally arms and face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has a fast epilator, I&#x27;d like to know about it!</li>
    <li> This product is good but it was too painful for me to use it. My hair was plucked out and sometimes it was bleeding. I just think that&#x27;s too much pain for me... I&#x27;d rather wax</li>
    <li> I originally bought this because it&#x27;s wireless, can be used on wet skin, and has a few extra attachments. This certainly does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, my only complaint is that it does take a few back-and-forth&#x27;s to get all the hairs. It&#x27;s also a little annoying that you cannot use the device while it&#x27;s plugged in. If it runs out of charge you have to plug it back in and wait for it to be ready. I also couldn&#x27;t use this on my legs. When I used it there, the areas where hair was plucked swelled a lot and I had these odd rash-looking bumps but they went away in no time. I&#x27;ve had problems waxing my legs too, so my guess is it&#x27;s just the area. Luckily I used to wax everything else before this epilator, so this still comes in handy, and I think it&#x27;s more forgiving than waxing is. Plus it&#x27;s much easier to do than and prep than waxing is!</li>
    <li> I thought that this woul save all my shaving problems but it did not. I have really sensitive skin and epilating my armpits have me ingrown hairs. This did it&#x27;s job but I personally did not like it</li>
    <li> The only reason why I got this was because I was going on vacation to Asian for a month and my really old Emjoy wouldn&#x27;t work with the plug in Asia. When I first tried it I loved it. Maybe because my Emjoy is so old it still hurts sometimes pulling the thicker hairs. This one no problem. I could hardly feel it and its a lot faster. The charging time is also awesome. I only charged it one time while I was in Asia and used it for my legs and underarm every week I was there. I have not tried the wet feature yet and am not sure if I will. Over all I have not had any issues with this product so far. I recommended this to my friend and so she got one as well.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this purchase. Although highly rated, I don&#x27;t believe that it is as good as it was rated.</li>
    <li> I hade to use it only twice in a month for the first time!  I do not shave anymore!  great thing! It is like having a new toy.  It hurt the first few min the first time. not anymore</li>
    <li> I wanted to try the Panasonic Epilator thinking it would work better than Nair, but it gave me more ingrown hairs then before! It was a waste of money &amp; I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> This was the first time I was using an epilator and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. I like the color and design the head is interchangeable and small enough to reach difficult areas a larger size head wouldn&#x27;t and it comes with a brush to clean the hairs out. When unboxing it I made sure the blades weren&#x27;t damaged to ensure that it doesn&#x27;t cause injuries and I charged it for 12 hours before attempting to use it. It&#x27;s all in the technique when using it I found that starting at level 1 tilting it toward you raising it slightly above the skin helps as the head will tilt against the skin. There is an ouch factor I for one have very low tolerance for pain but with the technique it hurts as much as you taking a tweezer for plucking if you attempt to go full on pressing it against the skin it will hurt for the first time. Then after a while for some reason you get accustomed to it (this is within the first session of using it by the way) I found that eventually I was able to press it against my skin as I would a razor (this was the surprising part) going up and down all in different directions doing it on my underarm and even below the waist. The only drawback is that I notice it doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs at once you really have to go over and over even at level 2 so like a razor I had to ensure I get everything so it took some time. I saw hair growth 2-3 days after using it but the hairs look thinner (something I wouldn&#x27;t see when using a razor) and also it wasn&#x27;t as much hairs when using a razor hopefully as I use it more it will take longer to grow back. As usual I use a solution after shaving to prevent razor bumps and ingrown hairs since I noticed that it was like using a razor.&lt;br /&gt;But I was pleasantly surprised that I didn&#x27;t spend my money on something so expensive only for it to be so painful I couldn&#x27;t use it. I bought it because I have a problem with dark underarms and I wanted to get the hairs at the root in the privacy of my own home and as often as I wanted to and this epilator accomplishes that. I would give it a five only it did hurt when I first used it I gave it a 4 because I can see myself using it pain free which is really good for an epilator.</li>
    <li> I had an old Emjoi from at least 5 years ago. This is tons better. I did spend quite a while reading reviews &amp; dithering about before I basically said what the heck - &amp; got this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I read reviews, I&#x27;d say complaints from others seem to come in 4 forms:&lt;br /&gt;1- too loud&lt;br /&gt;2- hurts&lt;br /&gt;3- takes a while/inefficient/breaks hairs&lt;br /&gt;4- ingrown hairs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1- this thing is astonishingly quiet. When I first turned it on, I had an ohhh dang moment, thinking how could this quiet thing ever work? Maybe I got a defective one, or it hadn&#x27;t charged long enough. My old Emjoi sounded like a John Deere lawn tractor.&lt;br /&gt;2- Ok well you are yanking out thousands of hairs by the roots. It&#x27;s gonna sting. Waxing hurts too. Some people commented that after a few passes it didn&#x27;t hurt as much so they were getting use to it. Wrong. You&#x27;ve gotten most of the hairs, so later passes pull fewer, which hurts less. Which means that after you tough it out for the first time, it won&#x27;t be that bad as long as you keep up with it.&lt;br /&gt;3- I&#x27;m not seeing this one. they ALL take a while. It&#x27;s not like waxing, there is no way to grab ALL the hairs on a pass. You might as well put on some tunes &amp; space out, while you make slow circles on your legs for a while. It&#x27;ll happen. As to the breaking of hairs, I would suggest that is not accurate. Your hair grows at different rates. The device can only get hairs of a certain length. I suspect that people who think they are feeling broken hairs, are instead seeing the small hairs stuck on the device head which WERE successfully pulled, &amp; THEN they&#x27;re running their hands over their legs &amp; feeling the stubble of the hairs that were too short to catch. If the mechanism is successfully pulling hair, then it&#x27;s not breaking it. You&#x27;re just feelign the hairs that are still too short.&lt;br /&gt;4- ladies...EXFOLIATE! Al those science shows talk about what an amazing thing the skin is - tough &amp; durable. Meanwhile, hairs are fairly delicate until they have been exposed to air. when you pull a hair, you destroy the path new growth would have traveled. It starts growing out &amp; hits the wall, literally. Give it some help. At the end of your bath or shower, when your skin is saturated, use a loofah or something to scrub your legs, &amp; afterward use Buddha Butter or lotion or something. I predict less trouble with ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am entirely pleased with this. It is so quiet! It holds a charge a very long time &amp; consistently. The Emjoi used AA batteries &amp; started out with a high &amp; efficient whir, then drooped in power to a pathetic whine. With this, I&#x27;ve done both legs thoroughly with no loss of power, then I just plug it back in. I did try it in the bath, in water, &amp; that was lame, but it&#x27;s more convenient anyway to do it dry. I suspect the whole wet/dry thing is just marketing, trying to be all things to all people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again &amp; would give it as a gift, even. the extras are unneeded tho.</li>
    <li> Good epilator. I like the previous model better, but this battery charges much faster. The previous model had 2 speeds and plucked my hair better. Although it does the job. Just takes a little bit longer...</li>
    <li> Great product! I would definitely recommend! Once it is fully charged, it last for 2-3 uses. Easy to clean it up!</li>
    <li> This is the only epilator I have ever had and I like it. It takes a little while to do, but lasts for several weeks. I do shave in between- just a quick going over- and my legs stay smoother than when I shave only. Its too painful for much use under my arms, but maybe everything is??</li>
    <li> Works like a beast, but I&#x27;m a wimp!!</li>
    <li> I loved this thing when I first got it. Yes, it does hurt the first couple of times you use it, especially if you aren&#x27;t already used to plucking/waxing. Didn&#x27;t have any problems using it in or out of the shower, and the charge lasted long enough for several uses. But after a while, I realized I was getting ingrown hairs from it, so now it&#x27;s back to shaving for me.</li>
    <li> DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT. I got a terrible ingrown hair after using this only a couple of times and following all the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions. It was so bad, it got infected and I had to go to a doctor and get antibiotics and an antibiotic ointment. I literally could have died as a result of using this. Not included in the price is the additional $30 in co-pays I spent on doctor and pharmacy bills.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I&#x27;ve used a lot of shavers over the years and would recommend this product.  This product has not irritated my skin or caused ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely thrilled with this purchase! I think it&#x27;s an unbelievable value for all that you get!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been doing research on epilators for weeks to make sure I got the one that was best for me. This little panasonic seems to have done the trick. I made sure to exfoliate properly prior to using and moisturized right after, and I don&#x27;t have any in grown hairs right now! When I shave I would have several of those ugly beast on the spot I shaved. The only disappointment for me is that I was under the impression you can use it while it&#x27;s charging. But surprisingly it has a really long charge and it doesn&#x27;t take it long to reboot, so it hasn&#x27;t bothered me one bit like I thought it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick tip, epilate right after a hot bath or shower and there&#x27;s virtually no pain! (For me anyway) :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALL WOMEN WHO SHAVE NEED THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> It works, but it does hurt me.  I tried putting a lidocaine ointment I use on my back to help, and that just made the hairs stick to my face and so it wouldn&#x27;t work right.</li>
    <li> I give it a 5 star rating based on the fact that it has been a very frustrating journey for me to find something to use that cuts shaving out almost entirely and this has done just that.  I am very happy with the fact that I do not have to shave every single day in order to have smooth legs.  Yes, it does hurt a lot at first, but I have gotten &#x27;used&#x27; to it from using it when I need to.  From my experience, the hairs that grow back in on my legs are not anywhere near as coarse and dark- which makes me super happy!  I recommend this product to any woman who is not afraid to go through a little bit of pain to save money on razors and the time it takes to shave.&lt;br /&gt;One other note: definitely exfoliate the skin in order to prevent ingrown hairs if you are prone to getting them from shaving or waxing (as epilating rips the hairs out of the follicle like waxing).</li>
    <li> this is the most efficient Epilator that I&#x27;ve ever had, it works properly in dry and wet situations. i just love it.</li>
    <li> I love using this epilator when I am too lazy to setup and clean up my waxing kit, which is often. I primarily use it on my face since I tend to wax for bigger areas. It&#x27;s great on trips since I can&#x27;t bring along my wax kit and I don&#x27;t like shaving my face. I love that it&#x27;s compact and easy to store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have never used one, it&#x27;s similar to tweezing. Instead of one tweezer, it&#x27;s many and they are going fast. This is not a painless option, rather it is convenient. I find that most options for removing hair are painful, so I just put up with it. Make sure to read the instructions in order to use the product properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be careful with the purplish heads. I remove them to clean the epilator and the thin bars that are the barrier can easily be bent on accident. If it happen, its easy to bend them back but I&#x27;m more careful now with that part.</li>
    <li> Like it so far. Does a pretty good job. Arrived quickly. Priced right.&lt;br /&gt;It is not painless but it is bearable.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for purchase.</li>
    <li> Worked only for one year. Then just stopped</li>
    <li> BEEN USING IT EVEN FOR A BRAZILIAN, IT WORKS WELL, PROVIDED ONE FOLLOWS RECOMMENDATIONS OF DOING IT IN OR RIGHT AFTER A SHOWER, CLEANING THE HEAD WITH ALCOHOL AND USING THE CORRECT HEAD. THE ONLY DOWNSIDE IS THAT THE SAFETY COVERS COME OFF EASILY, SO SOMETIMES THEY SNAP OFF WHEN GLIDING OVER BONY AREAS.</li>
    <li> Its really painful at first but its why they say beauty hurts. It does its job and the pain was all worth it. At first, it really hurt then it got numb so I took off the cap and it just tingled and was so much better that way. I really like that its rechargeable instead of buying batteries every time.</li>
    <li> FOR REAL: best product. I&#x27;ve had mines for three years and it&#x27;s still working great! I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. Didn&#x27;t get paid for this review</li>
    <li> I really love it. I used before the Braun Silk Epil Xelle. This one is 1000 times better. I feel no pain and I love the 40 min battery and the extras.</li>
    <li> This product is really good, battery stays for long time. Though its not great on wet skin, I would say its good on dry skin.</li>
    <li> This hurts. lt&#x27;s so bad, it pulls out the hair it doesn&#x27;t shave it off. Now I saw nothing on the ad that stated there was high pain involved.  I at least thought the hair would not grow back so fast since it was pulled out by the root.  WRONG.  It grew back just as fast. Not worth it.  I removed hair off my legs and underarm, I can not imagine taking hair off any other part of my body with this..</li>
    <li> I think it works pretty well! It doesn&#x27;t pick up hair by just going over the area once, but few times will do! I wish it worked while it was charging though. So when you realize the battery is out you have to wait an hour to charge to use. Also it works better dry than on wet!</li>
    <li> I had to return this epilator because it just didn&#x27;t grab the hairs despite them being the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; length ect.  I had to go over and over and over a spot so many times that sometimes I just tweezed the hair myself.  So frustrating.  I returned it for another Braun.</li>
    <li> its ok...doesnt get all the hairs even after passing it a million times over the same spot....could have been better.</li>
    <li> Awesome it works in the shower and can be used several times before needing a recharge.</li>
    <li> Even fully charged, this does NOT work as advertised.  Don&#x27;t make my mistake - spend the extra money to get a good one that actually does what it says it&#x27;s going to do.</li>
    <li> This takes some getting used to, but it saves me SO MUCH TIME getting ready in the morning. Ensure that you exfoliate regularly and you will have no problems. I truly appreciate that this is water-proof, and that it holds a good charge (~1 hour of continuous use). My only wish is that it could be used while charging. I would (and do) recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> Using the tweezing is a little painful but the trimmer portion and shaver work great.  Great for trimming and shaving.  Jury is still out on the tweezing.</li>
    <li> This is my third epilator. The first two were Emjoi and one latex 7 years, the other 5 years.  I think the reason some people experience discomfort the first time is they have not yet learned to use an emulator properly.  This is not a toy.  You really do need to read the directions. I am a complete wussy when it comes to pain, and seriosly this epilator doesn&#x27;t hurt me at all for underarm use. I have not tried it on my legs because I long ago used home electrolysis to permanently remove my leg hair (smartest thing I ever did, cosmetically.  I do use it on my face, mostly in front of my ears where it works very well.  It is only on the upper lip that it can be mildly uncomfortable.  I find it a lot easier to use wet than dry and way more comfortable than a razor and of course it does a better job. My hair is quite coarse and it leaves my skin beautifully clean with no bumps.  I highly recommend this model.</li>
    <li> I liked in beginning.  Not sure if gets dull, need to work at it.  Doesn&#x27;t pick up all the hairs.</li>
    <li> But really who could really enjoy this product? masochists? Works like it should if you don&#x27;t mind sweating bullets while torturing yourself. Great way to build a type of pain tolerance. Its cruel and unusual. I only used this on my legs maybe 3 times total. You will build tolerance but the ingrown hairs are not worth it. Keep on shaving ladies.</li>
    <li> For the price, it still seem that it hurt my girl when she use it. It wasn&#x27;t smooth like some people said but I rather next time buy one that is cheaper if the pain is still gonna happen.</li>
    <li> I bought this article for my wife. She has been used other brand for a long time. She told me this ES-WD51 is awesome   because it is more faster and so accurate than previous brand. I have no pain when I use it. The shaving is so great. . I can use it every where because it is after charging I can use it without wire.I am so happy to change it. It is worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought this back in 2012 and never got around to writing a review, but I love it so much, I felt compelled to. This works amazing. I had never used an epilator before but I have been converted. So much more convenient than waxing and long lasting than shaving. It is perfect. The charge lasts really long which is nice. My only complaint would be that the bikini trimmer doesn&#x27;t work that well. I would buy this again and again. Great product.</li>
    <li> Fantastic; works exactly as I expected. If your hair is on the fine side, you do need to go over it a couple of times to get everything off, but it&#x27;s not impossible. It didn&#x27;t seem to catch much when the guard was on, so I just stopped using that altogether (I probably just don&#x27;t grow my body hair out long enough for it to be useful). However, don&#x27;t bother if you&#x27;re not okay with the ouch factor of tweezing or waxing - this isn&#x27;t going to magically make the experience of pulling out your body hair any more pleasant.</li>
    <li> my daughter in love just love this Epilator, this was a winner!</li>
    <li> i bought this at a store and it was my first time using an epilator so yes it did hurt but not as bad as waxing i might just ise epilators unstead of shaving because shaving causes some cuts and thicker hair so i recomend this to people who do t think they will cry and yes u might get&lt;br /&gt;in grown hairs</li>
    <li> Ive been looking at all the available epilators and bought this one, based on the reviews it has had on various websites. I love it! It hurts like hell, but I was prepared for that coz I read that all of them hurt.  Battery lasts as long as I need it to. Great swize, weight and design.</li>
    <li> I am fair with sensitive skin and have had experience with a variety of hair removal processes so I thought I would give an epilator a try. I am so glad that I purchased this little puppy. I have had it a couple of months and have only had to use it twice; though granted as a long time waxer, I have relatively slow hair growth. I touched up a bit once somewhere in there but wow, soooo much better than waxing and not any more or less painful. Buy bikini zone roll-on and you will be all set to go with no scary ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> I am new to the epilation game. I heard about it many years ago, but it wasn&#x27;t until last summer that I acquired my first epilator: a Braun model. That particular model only had 24 heads and a narrow epilation area, so I decided to bop around online to find a wider head to speed up the process of pulling out the hair on my legs. As you can most likely determine, I settled on the Panasonic ES-ED51-P Wet/Dry Epilator. After using this for a few months, I have come to a mixed conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Construction&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic ES-WD51-P (henceforth abbreviated as the PES) is a relatively lightweight epilator with interchangeable heads designed to manage your epilation needs. Since the product description elaborates on the components of the epilator, I won&#x27;t get into the nitty-gritty, but I will point out:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• The razor recharges quickly and the battery does last a long while. After using it a few times, the maintenance epilations use so little of the battery power that I generally only need to recharge it for 20 minutes, if that. Unfortunately, as others have indicated, you cannot use the razor while it is charging, which I understand since this is a wet/dry model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Changing the heads is easy and takes only a few seconds to remove, install, and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wide Epilation Head&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Works best against flat surfaces; any type of curve/bump and it will miss the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detail Epilation Head&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Is ideal for facial hair; the small opening for the tweezer heads is slightly awkward in its placement, limiting the practical use on delicate areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor Head&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Does not shave close to the skin; is a nice inclusion with the epilator, but personally, I rarely use it. Works better if used in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok Stacy, But How Does It Work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After charging the PES I eagerly fired up the unit to use for my legs. Since I hadn&#x27;t epilated my legs in a while, the hair was fairly long and the PES was not as efficient in plucking it. Maintenance epilation goes better, but I quickly learned that the unit best functions when your body hair is only a few days growth. If your legs are reminiscent of Sasquatch, you may have difficulty on the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the wide epilation head is great in relation to the amount of skin it covers in a pass. Unfortunately, the tweezers rotate very slowly on the PES. It spins quickly enough to pluck hairs, but the slow speed of the head means the hairs are pulled slower, which results in this PES hurting more than my old Braun epilator. This is especially obvious when using the unit to remove hairs from &amp;#34;thin-skinned&amp;#34; areas; hair around the ankles results in an &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34;! The good news is that the pain is momentary; other areas I barely felt. For what I did feel, it was no worse than a light pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of hair removal the PES is good, but not great. It will take several passes to remove all of the hair from a patch of skin, but with the wider head especially, you can generally epilate both legs within a half hour or less. If you are just touching up those areas that seem to grow back overnight, you will spend less than ten minutes with the PES. I have found that the best method for me is similar to painting a room: the PES functions as the roller and covers large areas, while my Braun is like the paintbrush and is used for edges and detail work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I found the PES to be less effective if you use the unit in the shower. While it is recommended that your skin be clean for the best results, it seemed to me that the PES was not &amp;#34;grabbing&amp;#34; onto the hairs when my legs were wet and was making the whole epilation process take much longer. After a few tries in the shower I gave up and stick to dry removal only. One tip that I gleaned, however: if your skin is warm from the shower the hair removal is slightly less painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overall&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end the Panasonic ES-WD51-P is a decent epilator, but could really use an RPM boost. The extra heads are a nice touch, and the width of the &amp;#34;primary&amp;#34; tweezer head makes for less time spent epilating. That being said, I really do not see the benefits of using this unit in the shower (unless you are shaving). Yes, there is a bit of pain involved due to the slow rotation speed of the epilator heads, but after a while you become accustomed to it. If you are worried that epilating your legs will be painful, it is not that bad, and as mentioned prior, is no worse that a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The PES is a handy unit that does its job without too many issues. Just remember to stay on top of your hair removal so that the hair doesn&#x27;t get too long for the PES, and in no time you will have smooth, sexy legs (and bikini and underarm areas) to show off in the warm days of summer. While I feel that the unit should be a bit cheaper, the portable nature of the PES means that you have the freedom to strike whatever poses that you need to get rid of hair, and thus paying that bit extra is pretty much worth it./&gt;Overall&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end the Panasonic ES-WD51-P is a decent epilator, but could really use an RPM boost.

    <li> The first time I used it, I took off those caps they have on top of the tweezers. I think they are safety caps for first time users. With the caps on, it restricts the tweezers being used. The first time I used it, I was a bit scared of the noise it made. It sounded like it was going to rip out my skin. Honestly, it sounds worse than it actually is. I only use this on my underarms because I felt as if it was breaking the leg hairs instead of pulling them out completely. I was never sure though. The main reason I bought this was because I did not like what razors were doing to my underarms. This has proven to show a decrease in the darkness of my underarms. The only complaint I have is that it won&#x27;t get small hairs so you have to let it grow out a bit or individually tweeze the smaller hairs. I like that you can use this in and out of the shower. I do suggest exfoliating beforehand to decrease the chances of ingrown hairs. It also comes with a shaver but I haven&#x27;t really gotten around to using it. Also, I think I should add that I do have sensitive skin but this hasn&#x27;t given me any problems at all and I&#x27;ve been using it for months now.</li>
    <li> works well dry but while wet leaves a lot of hairs unepilated. would recommend to anyone looking for a basic epilator</li>
    <li> Not what I was expecting...Panasonic is a great brand, this is not a great product...</li>
    <li> It is Not as fast as my previous Braun Epilator, but over all It works very well for me, I got used to the speed and I love it.</li>
    <li> I only needed to epilate my armpits and bikini areas as there&#x27;s very little hair strands on my legs that are thick enough to be noticed and tweezing can get the job done in less than a minute. I&#x27;ve tried some methods of hair removal before, like waxing and laser hair removal. I tried both methods only once and after the session I didn&#x27;t want to follow up with the methods because:&lt;br /&gt;Waxing - not permanent, leaves a sticky after feeling on the skin, costs money. Only tried on armpits, and I decided that I prefer tweezing myself.&lt;br /&gt;Laser hair removal - have to go for several sessions for complete permanent removal, very expensive. Also tried on armpits only. The cost of doing it on the bikini area was extremely expensive so I skipped it.&lt;br /&gt;Since then I usually tweeze my entire armpit area. I&#x27;ve tweezed the whole bikini area over the span for a few days. It took so much effort and time and was so backbreaking that I only did it once in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked this epilator among the rest as it was the highest rated epilator that was lowest in cost in Amazon. Besides, several sites recommend it for epilating the bikini area. I&#x27;ve only used it once on my armpit and my bikini area before I wrote this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I was used to tweezing my armpits already, using this epilator (dry) on my armpits is fairly painless, though you will experience tingling sensation. It saved me some after-twist-neck-pain and quite a bit of time. It managed to get rid of all my hairs though there were a few areas that I had to glide over a few times. That&#x27;s because some of my hairs lay flat on the surface on the skin and the tweezer couldn&#x27;t grab them properly, but still it got rid of all my armpit hair eventually in a shorter amount of time. So I am fairly pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the bikini area, I&#x27;ve used it epilate only upper half of the bikini area so far. As tweezing the bikini area was quite painful for me, using the epilator had a similar pain level. I didit dry the first time and wet (using aloe vera gel) second time. It&#x27;s weird that I find the dry less painful, but still painful. I was mentally prepared for the pain because tweezing it was already painful, so I don&#x27;t expect the epilator to be much less painful. Also, the epilator also did not grab some of the hairs because the hairs either were too short or lay too flat on the surface of my skin, and I had to glide over a few times, or I just tweeze those few hairs that refuse to stand to be epilated. Still the epilator does the job in shorter amount of time and saved me some back pain from having to bend down and tweeze every single bit of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am pleased with the epilator, though the design does have it&#x27;s limitations. Maybe the product designers may want to introduce some kind of suction power like a vacuum cleaner into the epilator to ensure all the hairs stand, so that the epilation is more effective.</li>
    <li> Painful but does the job! In shower recommended! Less pain but more mess. Easy to clean and easy to use!</li>
    <li> This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve had, so I don&#x27;t have much experience. But I really like it and use it often. At first, it is slightly painful, but after using it several times, I hardly feel it. There are several heads so you can adjust the hair removal to your liking. This is cheaper than several versions that I&#x27;ve looked at, but probably just as good of quality. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love it! When the purchase was unsafe because it was the first time I bought this brand but now after using it I can say it is the best and least painful. The battery charge is rapid. Bring a comfortable pouch for storing accessories.</li>
    <li> It is fast, efficient and painless. Lasts forever, looks feminine, easy to clean. My first one of this brand lasted about 6 years until the tweezer cylinder broke. It is still working perfectly in shaving mode. I bought this new model and found it is faster and smoother. I just love it.</li>
    <li> I love it. It works perfectly the way I wanted. I&#x27;m so happy with my product, and I recommend it to everyone who wants to buy a multi perpose epilator .</li>
    <li> Seriously? As a Prime member for years, I hadnt had the problem like this but Amazon sent me the one looks new in package but there were someone&#x27;s hairs on it. I have owned same one before, so I can tell someone actually used it and the hair on it (the hairs got caught on the metal part you know). I can&#x27;t believe it how Amazon do this in their business. Of course I returned it!! So, be aware if you order this, you might receive the one I return it. I feel still sick of it. By the way, I found same one on Walgreen $65 and I get 2 miles per dollar I use, so I went for that.</li>
    <li> It is really easy to use when you are taking shower and does not take a lot of time. If you put body soap on it when using, it will make your skin softer.</li>
    <li> you don&#x27;t even feel it when you use it under the shower.&lt;br /&gt;it does not make that mush noise as my previous epilator.&lt;br /&gt;very very satisfied</li>
    <li> PRO:&lt;br /&gt;- electric shaver option&lt;br /&gt;- wet/dry and cordless&lt;br /&gt;- more gentle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- takes forever to remove hair&lt;br /&gt;- cordless is nice, but then you risk dead battery and having to charge it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMEND INSTEAD:&lt;br /&gt;Remington Smooth and Silky Full Size Epilator (EP6010) is much better. This epilator is at least 2x faster at removing the hair. It isn&#x27;t quite as gentle, but it makes up for that in speed and price.</li>
    <li> The wife says takes the hair out without the pain... relatively speaking of course.  Definitely worth the price that I paid.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item in November and loved it. I would have rated it a 5+ if I could. The two-row design is comfortable and removes both fine and coarse hair in one or two passes. The motor was quieter than other epilators I have used and the battery life was usually long enough (although I prefer using AAA batteries that I can change and recharge while still being able to use the unit.) One day after using it for about 10 minutes the motor suddenly revved up and it stopped working. The gears were stripped. So I tossed the epilator head and ordered another one. I assumed that a long hair had wound around the rollers and locked it up. Having interchangeable bodies was handy: when one stopped I could put the head on the other one and have plenty of battery charge left.&lt;br /&gt;Then in July the new one did the same thing. I had been very careful with this one to get no long hairs caught in it. When I checked my order history to see how long I had used it I found that not only had the second one lasted only 4 months, but the first one lasted exactly 4 months! I realize the price is much lower than other models but $100 a year is just too much! I paid $20 to $25 dollars for the Panasonics that used AAA batteries and they each lasted 18-24 months before the batteries would no longer charge. Since other wet/dry epilators use plastic gears, I can only presume that it is the two-row design that is the problem. I am disappointed that a Panasonic device would break so soon.</li>
    <li> I bought this Epilator back in January. It was my first epilator and I&#x27;ve told all of my friends about it since. I think it does a wonderful job and is significant&#x27;y better than shaving to all degrees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately it overheated and broke last night. I&#x27;m not sure what caused this, but i&#x27;m sure I will purchase the exact same one. I think it&#x27;s a very good value for having lasted 9 months!</li>
    <li> I read a million reviews before purchasing this Panasonic Epilator. After reading reviews of cheaper and more expensive models, I chose this model, because the ONLY thing that stood out about the more expensive epilators&#x27; reviews (such as the Phillips), was that the more expensive model supposedly removed more hair in a single pass. My only concern with this epilator was that it may miss finer hairs. These concerns were based on all of the reviews of a dozen or more epilators. FIRST; this epilator DOES pull all of my hair in a particular region in one pass when I hold it perpendicular to my body, when I am not using a head cover attachment, and go SLOW, as in taking five full seconds to move up the length of my lower leg. SECOND; It pulls even the finest hairs from the root. One reviewer of the Phillips (who prefered the Phillips) said that this epilator missed her fine hairs because it only has one fast speed. I can tell this is getting my fine hairs from the root, because I can see the tiny almost invisibly thin hairs on the epilator and can see the tiny root bulb.&lt;br /&gt;This gets hairs from the root consistently, NO TEARING! Gets ALL THE HAIR in one-two passes. It also gets incredibly short hairs. I can epilate after one day of not shaving and this epilator plucks the tiny stubble.&lt;br /&gt;As a first time epilator, who has never waxed anything other than her eyebrows, and who is a die hard shaver (I previously HAD to shave every day), I have so many comments and so much advice on this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Epilator: The Panasonic ES-WD51-P Ladies Wet/Dry Epilator:&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend this epilator for first timers especially AND long time users. The Phillips (~$100+) comes with attachments, BUT that brand&#x27;s attachments only add &amp;#34;massagers&amp;#34; to the outside rim of the tweezing head. In many YouTube reviews, the reviewers say the &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; is just little plastic fingers that don&#x27;t move, but drag against your skin as you move the epilator. On the otherhand, the attachments that come with this epilator are EXTREMELY USEFUL. There is an attachment that shrinks the number of tweezers from ten to three. This is very useful for sensitive areas and getting used to epilating as well as areas that have a lot of hair and smaller regions like the underarms and bikini area (see advice below). This epilator charges fast and lasts a long time on a charge. You cannot use it while plugged in, but now that I&#x27;ve used one I don&#x27;t feel like I would need to use it while plugged in. Plus, the cord could easily get in the way if using while plugged in. The next attachment exposes all of the tweezers, but elevates them slightly so that you aren&#x27;t getting every last little tiny hair at once (again, great for the first pass when you have a lot of hair, or for beginners getting used to the epilator). Finally, it has a shaver head, which does work and cuts close to the skin for a smooth finish. Even without any attachments, the epilator works amazing and has never tugged at my skin, only tugs out the hair. Overall- I would buy this epilator again. I&#x27;ve shown it to my sister and she was sold on it and is looking to buy the same one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EPILATING (the experience): Ouch. There is no way around it, tugging hair out of your skin is painful. It feels like constant tiny electric shocks. The tugging feels akin to the quick sensation you get when you nick your skin when shaving (not the pain of it, but the tug against the skin). I was actually scared of the epilator when I first turned it on, so my husband tried it on the back of his hand. He immediately thrust it back at me and said it was worse than a tattoo. I think he was exaggerating, and he has hair that is longer than the recommended length for epilating, but that just tells you how NOT comfortable it is. However, there is hope (see advice). I ended up knowing it was worth the pain the first time I ran it against my legs and they were completely hair free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REGIONS OF BODY:&lt;br /&gt;Underarms/armpits: are surprisingly the least painful. It starts as painful and after a few seconds is just annoying.&lt;br /&gt;Bikini: Also, uncomfortable, but tolerable. The hair here tends to be thicker, so there is more of a tug on the skin in this area. This can cause the epilator to &amp;#34;jump&amp;#34;. It doesn&#x27;t necessarily cause more pain, but is a little disconcerting because of how much you feel each hair being plucked. It really reminds me of nicking my skin with a razor, just the snagging sensation, not the pain.&lt;br /&gt;Lower Legs: Pretty painful. I have to take breaks. Lower legs can get little red/bruised spots when the hairs are plucked. For me, it was only the first time. For some users this continues for years.&lt;br /&gt;Thighs: Intolerably painful. I cannot do it. Everyone I know says thighs are by far the worst.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT USE ON FACE: I&#x27;ve read this and can only assume it&#x27;s good advice.&lt;br /&gt;Arms: Have not tried, but according to my husband, it&#x27;s hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to WAXING: You have to wait for hair to be longer to wax, so you can have more hair free days with an epilator. Plus, a one time purchase of an epilator will be much cheaper than regular waxing, even if the epilator only lasts you a couple of years. Epilating makes a painful process less painful and more drawn out. Six to one half dozen..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to SHAVING: I am obsessed with the super slick smooth feel of fresh shaved skin and that feel is due in part to the razor exfoliating your skin as it cuts hairs. After epilating, my skin has a texture to it, due to the hairs being pulled out and leaving microscopic raised regions of the top dead layer of skin. It is almost unnoticeable, but I do notice. What I do is epilate, to prevent stubble for much longer than shaving would, then I shave the next day or exfoliate. Despite there being nothing to shave, this just gives me that clean shaven feel. Epilating has me sold, because my skin is smooth when I wake up. I don&#x27;t wake up withstubble anywhere, so I automatically feel cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to CREAM HAIR REMOVERS: Cream hair removers often soften hairs more than they actually entirely remove them. They wear down the exterior of the hair shaft until it is very thin and some of them actually go away, but not many. An epilator is in my opinion, one hundred percent better than cream hair removers. It gets the root and hence, the entire hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADVICE/TIPS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW TO EPILATE: Once the device is charged, push the button to start the tweezers rotating. If this is your first time, use the attachment that exposes only three tweezer heads. Apply to skin at a 90 degree angle from your body. Read the pamphlet on direction. I find it does not matter what direction I move the epilator in relation to hair growth. Hold skin taut when possible. Keep skin very dry. Do not use any lotions beforehand.&lt;br /&gt;Use the tweezers without a head attachment/cover once you are ready to pluck every hair. You will feel more tugging, but ironically, reduced pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PAIN: There are multiple ways to approach alleviating the pain of epilating. First off; take ibuprofen before attempting. I took 800mg before the first time, and was able to epilate my entire body sans thighs. Also, I realize I could probably use my husband&#x27;s Dr. Numb cream (for tattoos) IF I wait for the anesthetic to sink in and then quickly rinse it off and dry my skin. The attachments help in various ways with pain; the three head attachment limits the epilating. This is crucial for getting used to the device. I also always start with this head when I am going at my underarms and bikini area. Take out some of the hair, then remove the attachment and get the rest. Holding your skin taut doesn&#x27;t necessarily decrease pain, but it decreases the tugging. Make sure your hair is only a few mm long. Think a day or two without shaving. I can epilate effectively after one day of not shaving, so the epilator gets very short hairs. The shorter the hair, the less pain. If your hair is too long, the epilator will only have room to pinch the hair and pull, and then release before the hair is entirely pulled out. I&#x27;ve heard this is very painful and obviously ineffective. I find that when I start to dwell on what the pain &amp;#34;feels like&amp;#34; i.e. electric shocks, reminding myself that all that is happening is harmless hair plucking, really does relieve some pain. My friend who only epilates and has for years swears by a glass of wine. As long as you&#x27;re not clumsy, a little numbing goes a long way. Finally, distractions can be good. Put on an easy to listen to, fun/funny movie. Think &amp;#34;My Best Friend&#x27;s Wedding&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Failure to Launch&amp;#34;, something that&#x27;s both entertaining to listen to, but not so exciting you need to look up. I use my Netflix app on my phone and listen in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other tips:&lt;br /&gt;Have VERY dry skin when doing this dry. Your skin will sweat when you experience pain. Even the tiniest amount can cause the epilator to drag. Have a towel on hand and thick tissues (not thin toilet paper). Regularly dry your skin and the epilator. Beware that the epilator will snag towels, so gently dry it in both directions to figure out which way snags the towel first, then just dry it off in the non-snagging direction after that. Tissues are handy to wipe out the little plucked hairs and to dry the surface of the epilator and your skin. Same as the towel, but towels can hold more moisture/take longer to dry, and tissues are cheap and you can use a ton to stay dry.&lt;br /&gt;Bleeding can occur- from the tiny places where the hair is plucked. Blood, even the tiniest amount, is sticky, so quickly dry it off of your skin and the epilator.&lt;br /&gt;Do NOT have any lotion or deodorant on skin. Skin should be clean, dry, and if possible, just exfoliated.&lt;br /&gt;Exfoliate after (the next shower you take) to prevent in-grown hairs. Of all of the epilating I&#x27;ve done, I&#x27;ve only ever had one in-grownhair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional props:&lt;br /&gt;This is GREAT to have before/during camping or a vacation. When you don&#x27;t have access to a shower and a shave, it feels amazing to wake up with no stubble. Even when your stubble finally starts to grow in, it is fine and reduced (not all hair grows back at once). This is also great for busy students, moms, anyone who doesn&#x27;t have a lot of time on a regular basis to spend on shaving, but who can find thirty minutes or so once a week. Even if I do a sloppy once over with the epilator, this still reduces shave time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time Required: The first time I epilated, I did my legs, underarms, and bikini area. It took me four hours, because I was constantly stopping, drying my skin, cleaning the epilator, and taking a breather from the pain. The first time you epilate is necessarily going to be the most painful and most drawn out because you will have the most hair. Afterward, upkeep doesn&#x27;t take long at all. Now, it takes me less time to epilate my legs than it does to apply shaving cream and shave, maybe two minutes a leg. Underarms take a few more minutes because your underarms have so many random curves, you have to go over them from multiple angles. Bikini area takes me the longest because the tugging is so noticeable that I can only do small areas at a time. I find it intense to use the epilator with no attachment on the bikini area, so I only use this after going over it with the three head attachment (so the time is extended due to multiple passes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a nut shell: Get THIS epilator and start epilating! Regardless of how you incorporate it into your hair removal routine, you will find it adds convenience. Whether you are using it on occasion, before a trip, or whether you use it religiously, the purchase will be worth your while. Go for this price point. Cheaper will give you a crummy motor or tweezers that don&#x27;t sit flush and won&#x27;t pluck hairs. More money buys you ceramic plates that supposedly are great, butdo everything this epilator does and offers fewer attachments. I am such a price comparison shopper and hate wasting money, so you can rely on my high rating! I have no regrets and love this epilator.</li>
    <li> I bought this item through my boyfriend&#x27;s account since he has Prime. This was my first time using a shaving device like this. Many of the reviews scared me because people said it was painful--sometimes enough so that those buyers never used it again. Tonight I took precautions and took some ibuprofen. I had tested this epilator previously on a small part of my leg with the \\&quot;beginner\\&quot; cover on it. Tonight I used the normal cover. There are definitely some parts of my leg that were more sensitive than others. I did my entire right leg (am going to finish the left in the morning). I used a anti-\\&quot;blemish\\&quot; liquid on my leg after I was done. The type I got is a preventative for ingrown hairs and helps soothe bumps/irritation. Five minutes later, after applying the preventative solution to my leg, it is soft and pain free. Epilating hurts a bit while you&#x27;re doing it but going slowly and fearlessly will make the process easier. I found this epilator to be quiet in comparison to some people reviewed on Youtube. I have yet to use the other features but will edit this when I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 10/11/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My original review for this device was done from my Nook, so please excuse it&#x27;s vagueness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now used the epilator for all functions that it comes with. 2 and a half weeks ago, I used the epilating head on both my legs. I find that taking a pain reliever before doing this, and stretching the skin to make it taut, enables me to get through both legs in one sitting. I believe over time, the \\&quot;pain\\&quot; anyone experiences when using this product will become less prevalent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me maybe 30 minutes to do both of my legs. I did this slowly enough so that every hair could be tweezed out. 2 and a half weeks later, my legs haven&#x27;t even grown the hair back. They still feel silky smooth! I&#x27;ve never received these results from waxing or shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used the bikini line head, which works pretty well. It will not give youthe same results as epilating, though. However, it does make the whole process a lot easier than using a razor, where you can cut yourself. Shaving with the bikini head was quick and easy. Keeping the device clean is also fairly simple. Other people pointed out that they had issues with getting ingrown hairs. I have had no problems with this device giving me those. AS a precaution, I put on a preventative solution. The type I use makes it to where there are no ugly bumps or irritation after epilating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that anyone who is willing to get through the initial discomfort of using this device will have amazing results. You also can&#x27;t beat the price. I would much rather have some discomfort, have to sometimes take pain reliever, and spend extra time epilating my legs than pay money for someone to wax... Or deal with cuts from shaving with a razor (not to mention you have to constantly buy shaving cream and new razors!) This item was a godsend and I am very happy I purchased it.</li>
    <li> The Epilators don&#x27;t get every hair, but it really saves time instead of tweezing one by one!</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I thought this was going to be perfect.  Sadly it breaks the hair off and then you end up with horrible in-grown hair bumps.  My legs had never looked worse.  I say had, because I stopped using it and threw it away.  What a waste of money.  I thought that with it being rechargeable it would be an improvement over having to &amp;#34;epilate&amp;#34; near a socket.  Unfortunately you give up a lot of power with a rechargeable epilator.  If you bought this recently enough to cancel the order, I would highly recommend that.  Otherwise be sure to use it and decide if you want to keep it while you still have the option of returning it. Previously I had used the Braun 2370 Silk-epil Eversoft Epilator/Shaver.  It is no longer available, but Braun seems to be a better product.  I used it for 10 years before getting this one.  Now I am back to using Gillette Venus Embrace Womens Razor and it works like a charm.  Smooth legs, no bumps and really lasts a few days.  With the epilators, both of them, I never REALLY had smooth legs.  Just &amp;#34;smooth enough&amp;#34;.  Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I am a 20 yr veteran of using epilators...first one had the spinning coils, 2nd one was an Epilady Descrete...both worked great but as they wore out, noticed decrease in effectiveness.  Needed one that was dual voltage so shopped and found this one...it does an awesome job! Don&#x27;t need the wet feature so can&#x27;t comment on it...would imagine it&#x27;s effectiveness is not so good since seems to me water would make hairs stick to skin...but hey! who cares if you&#x27;re not using that feature.  The product came charged to a certain degree...used it 3-4 times before charging myself.  Took couple hours to charge. Love that it is cordless, neither of my first 2 were...great feature. Head swivels, (first 2 didn&#x27;t) makes for a very smooth \\&quot;shave\\&quot; Very quiet compared to my first 2. Shape is very comfortable in the hand...very different from the original Epilady and the Discrete. Tweezer cover snaps on tightly enough to stay. Head removal for cleaning is easy. The carry bag is cheap though...too big actually for the product and it&#x27;s cord/attachments. It bangs around in the bag so I pack differently. I would definitely buy this again or as a gift for someone I knew uses an epilator.</li>
    <li> This was the first epilator I&#x27;ve bought. Happy to report the pain is minimal and the wet/dry feature is nice.  Would be okay with more pain if it removed hair better - I have to use several passes and can still see hairs that were missed.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> you have to shave your legs before using it and then let your hair grow to a certain lenght before it works, big waste of money</li>
    <li> this worked good for about 6-8 months. suddenly discovered a region in the plastic head had broken. This makes epilation difficult, sometimes cuts the skin.</li>
    <li> Great razor. The only thing lacking is a light.</li>
    <li> I love it in the sense that it works, and I don&#x27;t get any hair growing for about two weeks. But I don&#x27;t love it because it hurts like hell. That&#x27;s all you want to know right- that it works and hurts like hell? Ok.. so we all know it is going to hurt, it&#x27;s suppose to hurt less the more you use it but to be honest it&#x27;s going to be awhile before you feel that that is happening. If you&#x27;re wondering whether it is going to work wet and dry- it is. If you charge it to its full potential it lasts quite a pretty long time before you have to recharge it. It&#x27;s very small and comes with its own pouch. It makes a bit of noise but nothing serious. If you&#x27;re also wondering about ingrown hairs- the amount that you well get if you don&#x27;t exfoliate or put some kind of cream, is quite crazy - as in a lot.  I honestly don&#x27;t really mind that part..but I know for some of you it will affect whether you buy an epilator or not. If it&#x27;s not a deal breaker- then get it. It&#x27;s worth it and better than shaving and waxing.</li>
    <li> I owned a Braun epilator but it broke so I had to get a new one. I chose this based on the reviews and it turned out ok - plenty of features at this price. BUT it is definitely more painful than the Braun one I had. I have been using epilator for years so I&#x27;m able to handle the pain. But if you are a first time epilator user, this is not the one for you.</li>
    <li> My skin use to get really irritated when I shaved.  Since I started using this epilator I no longer suffer from skin irritation.  I use it for my under arms, my legs and my bikini area (that took some getting used to due to pain).  Be aware if you have never used one that it can be quite painful at first, and it takes a few times to remove all the hair.  After a while the hair comes off easily.  I really like it.</li>
    <li> I do like that it has a larger head, but it doesn&#x27;t get the finer hairs.</li>
    <li> I haved been using epi machines since quite a while now. Funny thing is, best I&#x27;ve tryed is the cheapest on the market. About this one, its not a bargain at all.&lt;br /&gt;Dont like the fact that you cant use it with the electric cord connected, so after a while (still in the same session) it starts to get slower. Slower is NOT GOOD!&lt;br /&gt;Have to run it in the same place many times to get rid of all the hairs. NOT GOOD again!&lt;br /&gt;Like tha fact that it can be used on the shower, yet dont really belive this makes a difference as a pain killer.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this one, its just been sitting inthe closet for 3 months now and I dont think its going to get out soon!</li>
    <li> I had never used an epilator before. This was my first one and now I am wondering why I have waited so long to buy it. It&#x27;s awesome. I have used it only once and I think it has already paid back the price. I could use it right after opening the box, didn&#x27;t even require charging. I know people complain it hurts but I am used to waxing so I thought this would be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I tried it for the first time, the pinching was real bad. I thought I could not use it and packed it back in the box. The next day, I decided to give it another try after taking a shower and it wasn&#x27;t bad at all. I was able to do both my legs and underarms. They feel soft like waxing. I think it just takes a little getting used to so you should not give up the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is I can use it on my own time, don&#x27;t have to waste weekends taking appointments and sitting in parlors.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot compare it with other epilators on the market but I like panasonic products so I bought it.</li>
    <li> It takes a while to get all the hair, and sometimes it wasnt completely pulled off from the roots, exfoliate your skin so it wont get ingrown hair. The pain wasnt that bad, just follow the instruction you will be good to go :D</li>
    <li> Al ilittle difficult to be thorough but quiet, effective, and easy to use, makes life easier</li>
    <li> Wife has loved this since I got it for her.</li>
    <li> Make sure it is fully charged. Epilating is painful art first, but gets better after you get used to it. I don&#x27;t recommend ever using it dry---it doesn&#x27;t work well and hurts more. Easy to clean. Doesn&#x27;t seem to hold enough charged to do both legs if you are epilating longer hair. Its great for appearing hairless, but not as smooth as a shave, will need to exfoliate for that.</li>
    <li> So, I tried shaving and waxing.  In the end the mess of waxing was too much.&lt;br /&gt;I read lots of reviews and this Epilator won me over based on price and reviews plus wet / dry and not a plugin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, how well does it work?  It works very very well.&lt;br /&gt;Like most have said if you read lots of reviews...&lt;br /&gt;Shower + exfoliate skin&lt;br /&gt;dry after the shower.  Wait a little while to really be dry.&lt;br /&gt;use the epilator to remove hair&lt;br /&gt;apply cream...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it is your first time for an area think about getting waxed first...&lt;br /&gt;OR&lt;br /&gt;shave it, wait a 2-3 days, take an alive + advil (if okay with your doctor)&lt;br /&gt;wait 30 min then just go for it...  it hurts for a few moments then nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time IS the worst!!  It also takes a long time... (I am a guy... lots of hair before this)&lt;br /&gt;After that follow up every few days to get the new hairs like 20 - 30 min depending... (like I said, I had lots of hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I did wrong, I applied cream once before use... it doesn&#x27;t grab the small hairs as well anymore... I needed to use it with body soap to get it working properly again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have / had thick coarse body hair.  white / mex mix heritage if that help you.&lt;br /&gt;It does take a few weeks of passes to really get rid of most of the body hair in an area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One common issue with waxing / epilators is ingrown hairs.  Yea, they happen... esp if you wear tight fitting cloths in an area on your body.  Just make sure you cream every day, twice a day and exfoliate in the shower to keep them limited.  If they happen the treatment is just loose fitting clothes, exfoliate and keep the skin moist anyhow.  If the hair follicle get of an ingrown is infected then get the tweezers + rubbing alcohol.  Clean the tweezers, gently rub / scrape to free the hair then pull it and clean the skin after with the rubbing alcohol.  If you have a number of read dots w/o hair witch hazel seems to help clear them up faster thanjust leaving them alone.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after reading all the mixed reviews. I Googled tips, etc. After all my reviewing efforts, I tried this out. I have tried it out dry, wet, with foam, used all the different attachments and more. It just does not work for me. I do not want to give this product a bad review because I don&#x27;t think it is bad. For me, I usually shave my legs. I thread and pluck my eyebrows and I wax any other areas. I also have hair electrolysis under my arms and bikini line because I hate shaving those areas. So, I figured I could handle any Epilation pain. The pain is not bad, but I couldn&#x27;t get used to it and it did not work quickly enough for me. There was always stubble left behind. I just could not get this to work and I sincerely do not know what I was doing wrong, but it has led me to believe that it is not the product, but that this product just is not for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the product in my opinion is worth a shot, and I encourage people to read many reviews and look up tips for using this product. It may just work for you and if it does, I&#x27;m jealous!</li>
    <li> So much less painful than my old one (not sure what company it was, definitely not panasonic). Even the sensitive areas, I don&#x27;t bleed or anything like I did with the other epi i used to use. I would never replace this thing, it&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re browsing around confused like I was before I ordered one, GET THIS ONE! &lt;3</li>
    <li> Its good but it does hurt, and you have to be patient with it. Not all the hair will come out the first time you use it, unless you&#x27;re willing to do it for hours and hours.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a year now and it&#x27;s still working welll.  It hurts at the beginning but now it&#x27;s nothing.  Pretty good for it&#x27;s price and quality.  I hope this will last pretty long.</li>
    <li> First off, you&#x27;re tearing hairs out of your skin, so of course it hurts. Get a tweezer and start plucking wherever you&#x27;re planning on using the epilator. If you can&#x27;t handle that pain, this is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fairly sensitive skin, but also a decent pain tolerance. I did as the directions said - took a nice long, warm shower and then got started. I started with the least sensitive area on my leg, then gradually worked my way to more sensitive. I rubbed coconut oil all over my legs when finished and only ended up with a few red areas that were gone by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a first timer, I think this epilator is great. It&#x27;s easy to hold and easy to use. If you&#x27;ve never used one before, this is definitely a great place to start.</li>
    <li> This was a gift but my daughter thinks this product really works well.  She has tried other products but none were good.</li>
    <li> I bought this one based on reviews. I should of listened to the reviewer stating how painful it was, and it is not quite.. it is loud&lt;br /&gt;I have used/purchased other epilators this one is soo painful. I tried it in the shower without soap, then with shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;Armpits: This pain was soo unbearable it did not get better over time. I had to finish the job. The next day my arm pit still hurt all I kept thinking was lazer hair removal..&lt;br /&gt;This is not worth the pain.. and I have a very high tolerance.. I dreaded using this.. not good when you are scared.&lt;br /&gt;WET:With shaving cream the hair kept sliding off the machine so that (wet/dry statement is for just water)</li>
    <li> After using this epilator for a couple weeks, I feel like I HAVE to write a review because I love this product so much. Honestly, I wish someone had told me about epilators sooner because it is so much easier than waxing and much more effective than shaving!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent most of my life shaving (I&#x27;m 25 now) and just started self-waxing in the last year. The only thing I really don&#x27;t like about waxing is all the time it takes. I finally caved and bought the Panasonic ES-WD51-P Wet/Dry Epilator when I saw it on Groupon Goods for half the price. Best. Purchase. Ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time will probably hurt quite a bit but I really think it is more because you are just so nervous about pulling out your own hair! If you keep up with it, it doesn&#x27;t really hurt at all and it takes just as much time as shaving. I personally use my epilator every other day and just run it over my legs, underarms, arms, and (don&#x27;t judge me) my downstairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it consistently, you will find that your hair comes back thinner and less frequently. To avoid pain, you MUST epilate often so that you are getting the hairs as they come in and are still short. Longer hairs will definitely hurt when epilating. Also, I use the epilator outside of the shower/tub when it is dry but the user guide says it hurts less if you use it with water/soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other commenters have mentioned problems with ingrown hair but I really haven&#x27;t had that issue. I make sure to exfoliate with a body scrub on a weekly basis and this seems to take care of any dead skin and ingrown hairs. If anything, i would say that waxing and shaving gave me really bad &amp;#34;bikini bumps&amp;#34; while epilating may only leave one or two.</li>
    <li> Pain, shear pain. Pay for the laser treatments and be done for good.</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator purchase and was pretty scared! But I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a better hair removal system that was inexpensive and I found it here! After reading reviews of several different brands &amp; models, I chose this one based on most positive number of reviews, being cordless, and the price, which was only $59 on the day I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now had this unit for about 2 months and have been epilating practically EVERYTHING approximately once a week.  I could probably go longer, but I think it&#x27;s less painful to do it a little more frequently since not as many hairs have grown back in a week&#x27;s time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The PAIN:  The first time I tried this this was extremely painful for me and took a very long time.  I did my lower legs in one sitting, but it took quite a while.  Thighs &amp; inner thighs almost brought tears to my eyes!  Tried it wet with shower gel, but I feel the wet method weakened the hairs and caused more breakage vs. actual tweezing (left my thighs feeling a bit stubbly.  So I would recommend only using it DRY.  Underarms were also very painful and took a couple days to complete the first time around so I could give myself a break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time around (and all subsequent times after that) and using it about once a week,I don&#x27;t feel pain any more at all.  Just a slight pinching in some more tender areas.  After the first time, I can now do all areas (legs, thighs, bikini line &amp; more, arms, and underarms all on one charge...it takes only about 45 minutes to complete ALL of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final note that I just discovered 2 weeks ago...I now do my legs, thighs, and arms with NO CAP -- just the bare epilator head now and get extremely smoother results!  I still use the gentle cap for underarms and bikini.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very, very happy with this purchase!!! I will never go back to shaving!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a Braun as well as an emjoi. The Braun was painful but really got the tough hairs. Unfortunately it broke down cause I do have some tough tough body hair. The emjoi was less painful but didn&#x27;t do as good of a job though the job was good enough(I could not use the emjoi in Europe as it does not respond to a European adapter plug), and finally there&#x27;s this. I&#x27;ve never epilated faster in my life. I began with my armpits which I must say is the most painful. After that I did each leg in about 20 minutes...mind you...it usually takes an hour for each leg when I use the other epilators! It was painful but I toughed it out. There is a system to easing the pain and here it is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure the hairs are not too short and not too long. When you are able to grip them with your finger nails you know this is the right length. Begin after the shower when your hairs are the most easy to grip and begin on an area that is very painful such as your armpit. Begin doing TINY TINY bits at a time. You may have to because of the pain...You will find that your skin reacts to the epilator and gains a little \\&quot;toughness\\&quot; allowing you to gradually take bigger chunks and areas without feeling so much pain. Make sure you stretch the skin tight on the area that you are epilating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very impressed with this machine even after reading the reviews that it is not as good as Braun. It is just as good if not better plus you&#x27;re not selling your soul to Proctor and Gamble, OH ThERE IS ONE CON: There&#x27;s no light on it so you cannot micro inspect the little hairs that you are epilating.</li>
    <li> I have been using epilators for the last 16 years and this is my 3rd one after a Phillips and a Braun. It is a nice looking unit that comes in a nice package with various accessories, but I still can&#x27;t decide if I like it or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Rechargeable and wireless - can be used without proximity to an outlet.&lt;br /&gt;2. Can be used wet and dry. I never had a wet one before and was excited about this feature, but wound up not using it much. At least you don&#x27;t have to worry about electrocution.&lt;br /&gt;3. Easy head replacement between attachments.&lt;br /&gt;4. Excellent shaver for a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;5. The attachments allow for various stages of grooming in different areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. It cannot be used while charging. If your battery runs out of juice before a big party, there is nothing you can do about it: have a backup or plan accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;2. The epilator wheels spin slowly, which may be beneficial for not ripping the hair out, however it appears that it takes a lifetime to do your legs. The tweezers seem to be missing hair, and you wind up going over the same area over, and over, and over again. It just doesn&#x27;t seem efficient.</li>
    <li> I bought this about a year ago. This was a good first epilator for me and was nice while it lasted. However, it constantly missed hairs and after a year of use is dying. I will say I really liked that it could be used in the shower and that it didn&#x27;t have to be plugged in to work. But, that being said, the charge didn&#x27;t last very long and you can&#x27;t use it while it is charging.</li>
    <li> still using it three years! and it still works perfectly. love it</li>
    <li> I really like this item.  Works great and is quiet to use.  I like that I can charge it and then not have to use a cord.  This means you can use it anywhere it is most comfortable to use.  Haven&#x27;t tried it in the water yet but that will come in handy.</li>
    <li> Never tried a product like this before, I found it to be very handy.  No more shaving cream !   It does seem like I have to make several passes over the same spots to get the visible hairs though, so that part makes it more time consuming than I had hoped.</li>
    <li> Being a female of Indian descent means your hair is jet black, coarse, persistent, and annoying. I&#x27;m 20 years old and I got tired of shaving because a clean shave is hard to achieve, stubble appears the next day, and shaving causes darkening of the skin (especially under the arms). I use this to epilate under my arms, arms, the slight hairs on my tummy (I don&#x27;t have much, it&#x27;s just that they&#x27;re jet black against brown skin so it&#x27;s more noticeable), and my legs. It does hurt, but I don&#x27;t mind pain much and you do get used to it. It&#x27;s not even that bad. I only use it in the shower because I don&#x27;t want to get hair everywhere, plus I tried dry epilation when I first received the item and it hurt more. It takes me about 5 minutes to do my underarms and I have to stop every 30 seconds or so to let the pain subside. It takes about 10 minutes to do both forearms. It honestly doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as you think it would. My hair grows fast, but it took 2 weeks for my hair to reappear. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many kind of epilators, Braun, Emjoi, Remington, Philips.  I must say this is the least painful epilator I&#x27;ve ever used.  There is no epilator without any pain, let&#x27;s face it, it will hurt, but it is not as bad as waxing.  This Panasonic epilator works fast, does not pinch my skin, and do the job at least amount of time.  This is the best epilator so far and I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> I bought this epilator at the store because I wanted it right away, a few days before the weekend. I used my mom&#x27;s eplilator a couple of decades ago, so I was a little worried that this would be another torture device in a pretty package. I don&#x27;t like the way my legs look after shaving, I hate the smell of depilatory creams, getting waxed at the spa is getting too expensive, and home waxing doesn&#x27;t work as well.   I went slowly the first time I used it, so I did have to recharge the device halfway through the process. I started with the beginner attachment, but after 5 minutes, I didn&#x27;t need it anymore. I didn&#x27;t have much pain when I did my legs from the knee down. I had minimal pain when I did my thighs. I must say I did one pass over my armpit and I shed a tear. I used to shaver attachment to finish that.   It got easier the more times I&#x27;ve used it. And I can do both legs without stopping to recharge. I still haven&#x27;t mustered the courage to try my armpits again, but maybe in time. I didn&#x27;t buy any of the special lotions that others have recommended. I went to the drug store and picked up the same scent-free/dye-free lotion that I use for new tattoos. But I didn&#x27;t have that much irritation, so I guess that would depend on the person. I definitely recommend using a loofah, body buffer, or some sort of exfoliation to avoid ingrown hairs. They may not prevent ingrown hairs for everyone, but again I guess that would depend on the person.</li>
    <li> This epilator leaves my skin hairless and is much less painful than my last epilator. However, it also takes about twice as long as my last epilator even though it has more tweezer heads (go figure).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I have been happy with the results. If you are looking for an affordable wet/dry epilator, this is a great buy.</li>
    <li> I had originally started looking for an epilator as an alternative for shaving. I&#x27;m going to live in a dorm for college so I didn&#x27;t want to spend endless hours in a communal shower trying to shave while not cutting myself. I have thin skin so that was impossible. I ultimately decided to buy because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A) My hair is very dark and grows fast&lt;br /&gt;B) My skin is very sensitive and can&#x27;t take being shaved every day&lt;br /&gt;C) Waxing was too expensive / too painful / not good for my sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to pick this model based on the reviews, the fact it was miles cheaper on Amazon, and the number of rotating heads. I am very happy with this choice! While I had plucked my eyebrows before (and do so regularly) I had never waxed or done anything close to epilating so I was worried about the pain and if it would make my skin break out. I saw a few tips that helped keep this from happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Exfoliate the skin before and after epilating to prevent hairs from becoming ingrown and to clean the area&lt;br /&gt;2. Take a dose of your favourite painkiller before the first time you use it&lt;br /&gt;3. Take a hot bath to help relax the skin and make it softer (hot water does NOT open your pores --- that&#x27;s a common misconception)&lt;br /&gt;4. Shave your legs a day or two before (I waited two days) so the hair is short but not too long. If it&#x27;s long it will be really painful.&lt;br /&gt;5. Put on some healing / calming / aloe vera lotion afterwords to help soothe the skin if you get red bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that it wasn&#x27;t painful at all the first time, after taking two ibuprofen. And I&#x27;m a real baby when it comes to pain; I don&#x27;t have any piercings or any tattoos. It felt like being poked by a very fine needle. I managed to get both of my lower legs done the first night. I had some red bumps on my legs, like I sometimes got after shaving when my skin was being sensitive, that had me worried. But after a sleeping and putting on some lotion they went away by almost 90%. Today I did my knees and upper legs and went over my calves to pick up what hair I had missed. Nearly all the hair is gone, but you have to have patience, you sometimes have to go over the same place a half-dozen times. Go over the same spot on multiple days to catch the hair that was too short before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked fine as for both wet and dry use. If you use it in a bath keep a dry handtowel nearby so you can keep it from getting wet and slippery. Using it dry is good for picking up the spots you couldn&#x27;t see while in the bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My legs feel really smooth and I&#x27;ve very satisfied! I haven&#x27;t tried it on my underarms or elsewhere but I&#x27;m sure it would work just fine for that as well.</li>
    <li> The epilator does what it says it would and does it comfortably, but my only problem was the hair growing back afterwards. Like some other reviews mentioned, this epilator leaves a lot of ingrown hairs. Since its ingrown, using the epilator again won&#x27;t remove it and makes your legs look hairier than before. I hate this problem, so I had to return it. Other than that, I am a first time user (never waxed before) and the epilator was not too painful. In addition, it comes with several parts so you can fit your personal needs, such as aiming for a smaller area. However, it is somewhat hard to clean because the hair gets everywhere and under the head as well. I have not used this problem in the &#x27;wet&#x27; condition so I cannot comment on that. Overall, if ingrown hair isn&#x27;t a problem for you, this is not too bad of a product.</li>
    <li> I have had 2 epilators in the past. This is ok but in future I&#x27;m going back to Braun silk-epil.&lt;br /&gt;I chose this new one because I wanted a wet&amp;dry epilator. It is really good being able to use it in the shower, however its not nearly as accurate as using a dry epilator. When I get out the shower I usually find I&#x27;ve missed whole sections as its harder to see the hair when its wet. It also cuts (rather than plucks) a lot so leaves some stubble like shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Not brilliant, a bit disappointed.</li>
    <li> I used Phillips set before, and I think I like that set more than this product. The only reason I don&#x27;t buy another Phillips set because their charger is 100V only, which is not common in different place, if I go travel. Also, I think this package should come with a smaller head for bikini area.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on this, and though mixed, I decided to try it out anyway. It&#x27;s no lie that the first time you use it, it freaking hurts, but as you keep going, your skin gets kind of numb and hurts a lot less. The one I read about shaving a day or two before trying it out was dead on. I was very glad of that. I didn&#x27;t get super smooth on the first try, but the more I&#x27;ve done it, the smoother my legs are. I also listened to the advice of another person who said to use in in the shower. That make it soooo much easier the first time also. Now I don&#x27;t need to and can do it dry, but that first time was tough. Using that water and soap helped a lot.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this.  I never have to be waxed.  I use it on facial hair, it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> Since it pulls the hair out one by one, it takes a really long time to get any area of size done (like your legs, for example).  It does what it says it will, though, so if you have the time to devote, this product works.</li>
    <li> super love it ; it works great. Although, at first it hurts but once you keep on using it  it wont hurt anymore</li>
    <li> bought them couple of years of back. And it&#x27;s still 1 of the most useful thing to have at home. Quick solution for a clean surface.</li>
    <li> This product is life changing! I have dark, course body hair that grows back really fast, so shaving was always a pain. I can&#x27;t wait for the summer when I won&#x27;t have to shave daily!</li>
    <li> ordered cause of the reviews, its great and would recommand it. I dont, it hurts like hell and can&#x27;t do it when hair is short. I wrather stay with Nair the hair removal cream and just wipe. Now I stuck with something I will never use.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected. It was very slow compared to what I have used in the past. I didn&#x27;t like it that much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve waxed my legs for years and after a friend shared her love of using a Panasonic epilator, I searched amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tell you, this was amazing quick and easy.  So much better then waxing.  The pain was minor compared to the wax pulling my skin, I don&#x27;t have to pluck after, this epilator provides great coverage dry.  I still haven&#x27;t tried it wet and may just use it dry for the convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean, just brush away the hairs.  Haven&#x27;t used the bikini attachment.</li>
    <li> I knew this was going to hurt, but WOW!  almost shocking the first time you use it.  I&#x27;m not complaining though.  Make sure when you use it that you take a warm shower first and allow for PLENTY of time to slowly go over your legs and get all the hairs.  It isn&#x27;t the quickest process.  Also I usually shave my legs about 3 or 4 days before I&#x27;m going to use it so the hair isn&#x27;t too long (seems to hurt more when it is).  If you take the time and do it right, my legs didn&#x27;t need shave for like 3 or 4 weeks!  So I think it is worth it.  I tried the arm pits....I may have to drink next time I attempt that one again.  It is not perfect, but it is an alternative to shaving just like it advertises!</li>
    <li> Compared to my old Phillips Satinelle, it takes a lot more to accomplish the same results. A little bigger too. Not a bad purchase though.</li>
    <li> this epilator is amazing it works so well, there no need to apply a razor to my legs or under arms again. i like this one because it came with the shaver head. very worth it.</li>
    <li> Comfortble and no hair no grow fast and get  soft, very compact and small which is take small place in bag</li>
    <li> I have been epilating for about a year now. I had been using a conair brand before and wasn&#x27;t too happy with it but figured those results were as good as it got for epilating. When my conair one broke, I researched and read reviews on numerous epilators before choosing this one. It is like night and day. This epilator is amazing! My legs are completely smooth now. Yes you will get some ingrown hairs, yes it hurts initially, and yes there a a few hairs left behind each time but nothing very noticeable. I&#x27;ll never go back to shaving. It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
    <li> for me the pain is just 1% , waxing is like 5%, that&#x27;s how i rate the pain if ur wondering how painful it is...&lt;br /&gt;it can be used for wet and dry, but i prefer dry, what i love about it is i can use it wherever i go. Just recharge it and ur off to go! I love the color, it is so lady like, and it comes with the pouch, with trimmer and shaver. I was like &amp;#34;where were you when i needed you&amp;#34; i used to shave my legs and pluck my underarm hair, and now with this, it makes my life easier :D it completes me ;)</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator ever and I&#x27;ve got to admit, I was really afraid of the potential pain. However, I was a little disappointed that I couldn&#x27;t use it as much down there.</li>
    <li> I actually bought an electric razor in addition to this epilator, thinking I wouldn&#x27;t like it. I was wrong! I love it, and have not even tried by electric razor! You have to get used to the &amp;#34;bee stings,&amp;#34; but once you are comfortable with the feeling, you can just zip the head along your body and take out hairs left and right. I use it every three or four days and notice my hair getting finer each time. Great value.</li>
    <li> It works.  It is Good but slow, it is decent value for money but should have gone for higher model.</li>
    <li> SO. USEFUL. I was worried by some of the reviewers, but since I mostly wax under my arms anyway, I&#x27;m used to the pain of hair removal. Moving over to this was an IMPROVEMENT. Still pulls out the hairs, can be painful, yes, and can result in ingrown hairs, yes. But my underarms are actually far more sensitive to shaving for some reason, so this is the least of several evils. It&#x27;s kind of like waxing but quicker and far les messy :) I also love the additional heads, so I can use the shaving head when the hairs are too low to be caught by the epi head :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend to anyone who&#x27;s not too afraid of a little pain (come on girls, we&#x27;re the gender with the higher pain threshold, remember :))</li>
    <li> I bought this on a Lightning Deal for $35.99. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend paying anything more than that. It&#x27;s adequate-nothing great. I wax my own legs and was looking for something to cut the time in half. This does that, but it doesn&#x27;t remove all of the hairs. I have to go over the same area many times. The pain is nothing to me, really, but as I said, I&#x27;m used to it since I wax my legs. Also, about half of the hairs were broken rather than pulled, so my legs don&#x27;t feel all that smooth.</li>
    <li> It works well has more tweezing.  Hell yeah it hurts, but hair grows slower, thinner, and becomes less painful as you  it.  I bought other brands before but they dont last forever.  I havent tried it wet skin surface yet.  Does the trick it u wanna avoid razor bumps, and shaving constantly</li>
    <li> Decided to try a new brand, because  lost my braun epilator. This one isn&#x27;t as powerful as the braun brand, but it does its job. Because its not as strong as the braun brand, it takes a little longer to sweep through the whole leg/area you are trying to cover. I love that the epilator is wireless though. But it&#x27;s too &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;/slow (not sure if this is the word I want to use) for me.</li>
    <li> it was very useful and small and can be used to any location...lol (ANY LOCATION) anywhere I LIKE IT ALOT</li>
    <li> I used the epi lady years ago and loved it.It took getting used  to because it litterally pulls the hair out, but I didn&#x27;t find it too painful.  I don&#x27;t have much hair left on my legs and I swear it is because of that. I bought the Panasonic Epilator because I like most Panasonic and I figured this has to be good. I really do like it . This does&#x27;nt hurt and the hair takes longer to grow back.</li>
    <li> First epilator that I can actually use, my previous experiences with them were almost traumatic. This epilator is really gentle! I am really happy that i Bought it. Great buy and a great price!</li>
    <li> The battery never die. I use sometimes 3-4 times per month and the battery still going. Is taking a little longer to me use it than I used to take with others product. Work very well</li>
    <li> Before buying this epilator I read all the reviews from it from Amazon. One of them said that the protective cap is helpful if you are not used to epilating but, if you are, it kind of slow the paces of the blades. Totally true. It works properly and it does takes off even small hair (and, I have to confess: I read it at Amazon and the manual said it too but I didn&#x27;t believe, and I was wrong - it does works better when the hair is shorter). But when you take off the protective cap, and let the epilating part open, it works much better. Of course, as it is projected for the protection of the customer, I strongly advise only doing it if you&#x27;re long used to epilators. It is, however, still slower than I thought... but, well, epilating takes its time normally. I tried it at the armpits and bikini area, and it works well too; at those parts you should always be careful, maybe using the protective cap and the beginners cap is safer.&lt;br /&gt;It is really the least painful I tried, but I don&#x27;t usually feel it too badly anyway. It is easy to clean and to hold during the epilation.&lt;br /&gt;It charges fast but, as a 1.80m woman with very long legs, a battery duration of 40 min is usually not enough to finish everything at once.&lt;br /&gt;As someone that uses waxes and epilators for a very long time, I can say that it is a good product, but I thought it would be better. I haven&#x27;t tried it in the shower yet, at the dry fashion is just fine. I&#x27;m now hoping that using it in the wet way is going to work faster ou better, and I&#x27;ll write the results here.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I bought this as a gift and it does work very well to remove the hair that it comes in contact with.  However, I am told that it is very painful to use on any part of the body and totally intolerable on some parts.  So, my recommendation is that if you do buy this you need to buy the cream that numbs the area to be treated first.  I gave it a three because the craftsmanship is good and it does what it says well.  However, it is &amp;#34;torture&amp;#34; to use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay for the price&lt;br /&gt;It works fine but you have to take a long time to get rid of everything!!!</li>
    <li> This thing is the bomb!  I have never used this type of product but have struggled for years as to what action I should take for my hairy parts ( which are many). I have tried waxing for my upper lip and always have a horrible experience.  I have given up on that long ago.  Have used irritating creams, plucked with tweezers and dealt with just having a hairy upper lip and neck (as I continue to age;). This is a deal changer for me.  I got my device yesterday, charged it and with a bit of trepidation decided to take a whack at the upper lip.  It was virtually painless for me.  Followed the instructions carefully.  Trimmed the hair so it wasn&#x27;t too long.  Used a warm compress to open the pores.( makes sense to me). Used the beginner attachment and voila! A piece of cake.  I have had no negative consequences such as  rash or breakouts.  I have what I consider to be sensitve skin ( fair and delicate). I&#x27;m going to proceed to other hairy places and will never go back to shaving or waxing ever again.  You have to try this!!  Once the task has been undertaken it is a no-brainer to proceed.</li>
    <li> I have used before lot of kind of epilators, but this one is perfect, I&#x27;m using it under arm, in the legs and in the bikini area without feeling any pain, I love this epilator and I recommand it !!!!</li>
    <li> I love this epilator so far. I didn&#x27;t think that this epilator hurt too much, even the bikini area. However, I have been waxing for years so maybe I am used to it.  Anyhow, I am VERY happy with my purchase. I just moved to Germany and now I can just do this at home rather than try to find a new waxing place.</li>
    <li> I must say, this epilator is pretty painless. The head that comes with it doesn&#x27;t allow for a huge area of skin to be exposed to the tweezers so the pain isn&#x27;t so terrible. However, that&#x27;s the downside for me as well. Since it doesn&#x27;t allow for full exposure, it takes more strokes to complete an area of skin. It also misses many of the fine hairs. I must say that I love that it is cordless. The power lasts long enough for what I do. I haven&#x27;t used it wet so I can&#x27;t comment on that feature. My shower is too dark for me to try to do that.</li>
    <li> I had a Braun depilator that I used for many years, so, when I decide to replace it, I researched a lot. The Braun was really expensive. Then, I read some reviews of the Panasonic ES-WD51-P Ladies Wet/Dry Epilator and I decided to buy it. I tried it, I used it, I read the manual, I tried to like it. Then, I tried more. But I couldn&#x27;t. I will not write a very long review because the reasons are simple: the Panasonic ES-WD51-P Ladies Wet/Dry Epilator doesn&#x27;t hurt (I&#x27;m very resistant to pain), in fact, is really gentle BUT WHY? Because IT IS NOT EFFECTIVE. You have to go over, and over, and over, and over, and still, if you have any finer hairs, it just doesn&#x27;t grab them. It was so frustrating. Besides, my old Braun had 3 speeds, this Panasonic has ONE. I was not satisfied. I don&#x27;t care about pain, my pain tolerance is high, I just need my hair totally and completely removed. As simple as that, and this product is NOT effective.</li>
    <li> I love this epilator! It works great! Wish I would have found out about this years ago.  It makes things so much easier and you can do it yourself.  Less painful than waxing, and better for you than shaving!  You do experience alittle pain the first couple of times, but then you get use to it.  Once you start using it you will want to start epilating your whole body!!</li>
    <li> Does not do a good enough job on my leg hair. It breaks the hairs or just fails to pull them out.</li>
    <li> It does hurt on the first time. If you are sensitive, you may have to complete an area in a few days rather than one sitting. I am not susceptible to bumps. My skin is just that way, so I do not use any special cream afterwards. I just use aveeno lotion. Now that there are only 5% of the hairs left (after a weeks time) the pain is barely noticeable when I go over the area again. I do wish that it would grab straggler hairs a bit more than it does. But it is an excellent product. This is my first epilator.</li>
    <li> I bought this after getting my legs sugared which didn&#x27;t get all the hairs out so I thought it&#x27;d be a great time to start with an epilady (read: less painful because not as many hairs to pull).  I&#x27;ve tried with this for a few months now and I&#x27;m great disappointed. For all the pain that it is physically, it&#x27;s not worth it because it simply doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs! I went months with partly hairy legs as I tried to master the thing and get it to work effectively. Sadly, I think I&#x27;m out of the return window since I gave it such a long trial. It also takes a long time to use. I originally figured I&#x27;d save time in the shower since I didn&#x27;t have to shave and only epilady once a week or so... not true. I was using the epilady for 10-15 minutes every few days trying to get all the hairs and it was just not working and taking too much time. Lastly, I am actually having some hairs grow back UNDER MY SKIN as a result so now I have to take tweezers and dig them out. Ouch!</li>
    <li> Great epilator! This is the first time I have ever used an epilator.  It definitley hurts - think of 50 little tweezers pulling 50 hairs at the same time.  I basically epilate the lower half of the legs dry after the shower (before I put on any lotion or anything), pull the skin back to make it tight, and epilate at a 90 degree angle.  The next day Ill shave my legs with a razor which gets rid of all the little hairs that the epilator might have missed.  Then I dont have to shave for a week!  I recommend this.</li>
    <li> I was worried about this product based on several reviews but I do love it! I have used an epilator before and do like this one.  Simple and easy to use with less pain than others.</li>
    <li> I have requested this item a month ago. And until now I have not receive it. Will be waiting to receive it, but until now, its nothing much I can say, except that is measing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used an epilator before, and been mainly a razor and soap kind of girl (I waxed a patch of hair on my leg once and oh god never again).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start by saying ow, this thing does hurt the first time using it. I wasn&#x27;t sure exactly how long the hair needed to be, so when I purchased it I just decided not to shave my legs until it came (maybe a weeks standard hair growth to give you an idea). In my opinion it was a bit too long because it tended to break some of the hairs and pull out others. It&#x27;s been like three days since I first used it and after just using it today (which mainly got the hairs that were broken and not from the root) all I can say is WOW! It hardly hurt getting the few tiny short hairs I had around on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The battery life is amazing, I was a big baby the first time using it and I guess it must have taken me an hour or more starting and stopping the thing getting all the hair and it still has juice left after I used it today. A few tips:&lt;br /&gt;1) Make the skin tight when doing it, it definitely hurts a lot less.&lt;br /&gt;2) Do it every few days, don&#x27;t wait for the hair to grow back, it took me like 2 minutes to do the small amount of hair I had the second time.&lt;br /&gt;3) It may hurt for a few seconds after you use the epilator, but the hurt doesn&#x27;t linger so it&#x27;s easier, for me at least, to move on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it on my legs so I cannot comment on the bikini area, maybe one day I&#x27;ll do that one.</li>
    <li> I have used an Epilady for a good many years. It finally gave out on me and I had to get a new one. I chose my Epilator by reading others review&#x27;s. I am happy to report, it has meet all my expectations. Thank You Panasonic.</li>
    <li> What do I do with ingrown hairs??? I didn&#x27;t have them before I started using the Panasonic ES-WD51-P Epiglide Ladies Wet Dry Epilator. If I would have known this was going to happen to me I would NOT gotten it.&lt;br /&gt;Now I can&#x27;t use a dress or skirts because the ingrown hair are very, very visible.&lt;br /&gt;If anybody that reads this review, if you have a solution please write back. Thanks, Angelica</li>
    <li> This product works well! it gets the unwanted hair out, and left your skin without the visible roots. I have dark hair, so roots really bothered me until I bought this. But I only give a 4 star because when I do my legs, I have to go over the same area a few times to get all of my hair out. It hurts a lot when I try to use for underarms. Even though I am satisfied with the result, I usually end up with pain and read skin for a few mins. So a 4 star</li>
    <li> My wife tried to use it and complained that it was a painful process . Some of her friends also confirmed that this was defective.&lt;br /&gt;I had to return it.</li>
    <li> This panasonic epilator works really nice...just read the instructions. Jus one thing too noise</li>
    <li> I tired one of my friends Epilator before buying my own. The one she has was much more painful, this one takes a bit longer to get all the hairs, but I would not trade it for hers any day!</li>
    <li> Not much powers because it is cordless. I end up having to go over the same spot multiple times to get hairs.  I like my Braun epilator much more</li>
    <li> this machine is good, practical, comfortable, takes up almost no space, you can use it whenever you want . . . .</li>
    <li> At first, it was taking FOREVER to epilate. (15 minutes a leg, at least!) I had to go over the same area a number of times. I have had this product for 8 months now, and am very pleased to say that I am only epilating about once a month, and that it only takes about 5 minutes a leg now. I have very little hair on my legs, and they are smooth for so long. The battery life lasts a really long time. I can go 2 months without having to charge it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did get ingrown hairs, but since I was going over my legs with a fine tooth comb, and taking so long anyway, I was always able to free the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does feel like a thousand tiny elastic bands slapping you, but like I said...give it a real chance, and not only does the pain go away, but it takes so little time for such a huge reward (with less hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also note that I am 5 months pregnant, and harrier than ever. This epilator has still managed to reduce my leg hair, and it is really the only safe thing (other than waxing) that I can do while pregnant to reduce hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend!</li>
    <li> Had high hopes for this product but I guess my skin is too sensitive for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Really like the electric shaver and bikini trimmer. Worked very well for me. It wasn&#x27;t painful when I used it as an Epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Had to go over hairs a few times before they would finally get grabbed. The biggest Con for me was that it gave me SO many ingrown hairs. After using it for a couple of weeks, my legs are still covered in skin colored raised bumps which are another form of ingrown hairs. It also gave me the red bumps and made me bleed in areas, which are now scabs. Random hairs would sprout up all the time around the bumps. My legs have never been this bumpy and ugly before. Never saw flawless, smooth legs while using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stopping the Epilator and going back to shaving. If I have to change out my razor more often to prevent ingrown hairs I will.</li>
    <li> It will be a lie if i say it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. It work best for hair of at least 1 cm long.</li>
    <li> Too much time consuming and not clean after u r dn</li>
    <li> This is my 1st epiglide and I have to say it works well. It has a different feel and I had to get use to it. It works well. I am glad I bought it</li>
    <li> This device works well, charges fast, and runs for a long time on a charge.  I also like the different attachments it comes with.  I hope to use this for a long, long time.</li>
    <li> I bought it a few month ago because I had one from this brand before and it worked well. This one is even better, some new features has made it more convenient and easier to use. Dual function, wet and dry is fantastic. its blade is sharper and it took just a few minutes, maybe 15 min to finish my legs. It was also charged so fast and took a long time to discharged again, I had Brown many years ago. This one is better than that. I love it.....</li>
    <li> I hate shaving and i&#x27;ve been waxing for yrs, but it takes a lot of time and can be pretty messy too. This epilator was the right answer to my problem. It works great, doesn&#x27;t hurt too much and u get used to it. Reasonable price for what it does. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Shifted back to German made Brawn .</li>
    <li> Of course it hurts. But only for a few seconds. This product seriously has been one of my best purchases.</li>
    <li> its wet or dry ,it shaves smooth,and has trainer covers to get used to the real trim,and don&#x27;t have to shave all the time which I like,easy glide for underarns net screen for no under arms burns.would buy it for my friends for a gift also.</li>
    <li> Really love this grooming aide.  Used one like it for years and eventually experienced &amp;#34;NO&amp;#34; hair re-growth on my legs.  Never have to worry about that again, ever!</li>
    <li> This was my 1st try at an epilator and have yet to get past the feel of it - But the shaver portion of this 2-n-1 product works great!</li>
    <li> I have been using this epilator for a while now. The great thing about this epilator is the batttery life. Once charged it lasts for a long time.</li>
    <li> I decided to get this because my first epilator was getting rather old. This one intrigued me because of it being cordless and usable in the shower. I have very thick, dark hair and pale skin, and my skin is also pretty sensitive. I have only epilated my legs with this once so far, but I can safely say that it is quite a bit less painful! However, it is not any more efficient than my last epilator despite having more tweezers and two heads. I still have to do a number of passes before I get all the hair, but I feel like that will always happen for those of us with very sturdy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are, however, a few major drawbacks when compared to my old one. First of all, my other epilator had a little LED light that was essential for seeing if you missed any hair. It&#x27;s very hard to tell with this one, as it has no light. Also, the battery really doesn&#x27;t last very long (30 to 45 minutes), and I don&#x27;t know about you, but with the multiple passes and everything, epilating all of both legs takes much longer than that.It also can&#x27;t be used while plugged in, which is sad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thinking of giving three stars, but I had to give it four if for no other reason than the reduction in pain. It is extremely significant. With my old epilator, I would never have even considered trying to epilate my underarms. However, since the pain was so slight on my legs with this one, I decided to give it a try today, and it was fine! A bit painful, but that is to be expected the first time. It worked really well though, so I&#x27;m quite excited about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in conclusion, it&#x27;s good, but lacking a few nice features of some other products on the market. Much less pain than the other one I had, so it&#x27;s worth it, but I don&#x27;t know how much the waterproof and cordless features matter to you, so it might be worth looking into something else if you want the light and it takes you a while. Otherwise, totally awesome.</li>
    <li> It removes hair so softly that i can&#x27;t even feel the pain. Compared to the panasonic one I previously owned, it works like magic. Love it!</li>
    <li> My wife hasn&#x27;t touched a razor since she bought this a year ago.  She has no complaints with it and convinced her sister to buy one.  My only complaint with this product is sometimes she threatens to use it on me!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t too happy with the purchase. I felt that it was rather painful for the time spent doing one area and it didn&#x27;t pick up all the hairs. I also found it hard to clean. If your hair grows fast you would see hair in a couple of days and have to start over again. Epilating is not for me.</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator. I&#x27;m really happy with it. It works well. But - you can not use it while it is plugged in (wired cord for charging it). You have to take it off the charger, which makes no sense.</li>
    <li> It worked right out of the box, it arrived immediately. It&#x27;s fast and not painful at all, plus it WORKS. After my braun silk epil stopped working properly due to its age, I decided to opt for this epilator and I made the right decision ;)</li>
    <li> I used this item in the shower. It was harsh on my skin, but I figured it would be less harsh later on. However, next time I recharged it fully, it would not turn on. The charging light turned on, but it wouldn&#x27;t shave. This is after a single use! Would not buy again. Go for one with a good warranty, if you must.</li>
    <li> Meets expectations as described in the product. Has a good performance, plus many opportunities to exchange parts for different uses.</li>
    <li> The product stopped working after about 7 months. Buy something else, or be ready to make use of the warranty.</li>
    <li> Ok, Tried the original epilady  years ago.  Pain was all I recalled.  2 years ago a bought a small &amp;#34;ezetweeze&amp;#34; for my little chin hairs that come when you&#x27;re Italian and over 40.  It was so much easier than tweezers and a 10x  mirror, that you practically have to stand on your head to see, then feel for and hope you got it.  Then it dawned on me why not try one for my legs.  Shaving proved to be a nearly every day&amp;#34; have to do&amp;#34;.(the Italian thing again)  Then I tried waxing and just couldn&#x27;t seem to get the wax just right for removal and ended up have to try to get all the sticky wax off. Geeze what a mess, is it worth it? or should I resolve to wear long pants for ever so no one sees what looks like I&#x27;m wearing wool socks.  Well here we are back to the beginning of this review.  After reading many reviews on many different brands I got the Panasonic. (my husband&#x27;s electric shaver is a Panasonic, which he likes a lot).  One of the reviews suggested to shave first then try the epilator a few days later. Thank you, what a great suggestion.  I now use my little &amp;#34;hair snagger&amp;#34; about once a week. The sensation is like a scratching tingle which is not bad in my opinion.  The fact that I only have to do it once or twice a week, and have really smooth legs every day is the best part of all.  It comes with a shaving head if for some reason I need to shave first again, which is good to have, even though I have not had to shave in a while. Also has a smaller cover I now use on my chinney chin chin.  I guess it is safe to so  I Love It! and recommend it to anyone who wants to try something other than daily shaving or messy waxing.</li>
    <li> I have had this epilator for about 2 weeks now and I am loving it! My sisters each purchased an epilator and were telling me how much they loved it so I couldn&#x27;t wait to buy one. They bought a different brand but I did a lot a research before purchasing this Panasonic epilator. So far it&#x27;s doing great and I have no complaints at all.&lt;br /&gt;When I first used it on my legs, it was very painful. Like you were getting shocked by tiny charges but that was on the first time I used it. I didnt use it over my entire legs but I did on my armpits. Now when I use it I barely remember how it used to hurt. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to have reduced course hairs on their legs. It doesn&#x27;t get every hair but you just have to go back over it enough to get. Don&#x27;t be scared to get one! It&#x27;s great and really does thin you hair. I haven&#x27;t used it on my bikini line yet but I would imagine it would be somewhat painful. It&#x27;s a great product and I&#x27;m very glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> It works awesome! Kind of hurts in the beginning but you&#x27;ll get used to it :P Overall, it&#x27;s a good product</li>
    <li> ** SUPER fast shipping and will definately buy from this seller again.. Thanks a mission as I was having withdrawls from my epilator who had an untimely death...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an avid &#x27;self&#x27; &#x27;waxer&#x27; since around the age of 20 and I&#x27;m now 42 I was growing tired of the mess and clean up with waxing however besides shaving which I do tend to despise on all levels, I wasn&#x27;t aware of any other option for the clean, smooth feeling you get status post a good wax..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is until I stumbled upon my first Panasonic wet/dry epilator and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since... My first one which was the model that was prior to this one here met an untimely death when I grabbed another cord that I thought was the epilators cord and plugged it into the outlet only to blow it to death as well as pop the circuit breaker within our casa...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mental note taken: ONLY use the power cord that comes with the model as they are specific to them primarily based on the volts/watts that the cord AND epilator can handle... Immediately upon blowing my first model out I jumped online and began to search online for her replacement.... After hours and hours of searching it became apparant to me that Panasonic was the way to go and so I ordered this beauty here...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I epilate my underams, entire legs, and ENTIRE bikini area... The ENTIRE bikini area if you catch my drift and this model is even better than the previous model it replaced.. Myself I&#x27;ve learned the ways to get the &#x27;best&#x27; removal and will share below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) Start with clean dry skin. No lotions, oils, dirt or moist skin will yield the best results. I have used it in the tub as directed with wet skin and shave cream and soap and the hair removal to date is the best on clean dry skin as I&#x27;ve described above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.) Wait until your hair has grown out about 1/8th to 1/4 of an inch for best removal. If the hair is too short it won&#x27;t grab it or if too long you stand the risk of it breaking off.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.) For underarms do not epilate when you have deoderant on. It drags along the skin and you will miss alot of the hair your intending to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.) Take an Ibuprofen or tylenol or pain reducer of your choice an hour before you do it if your sensitive to things like this or have a low tolerance to pain you&#x27;ll be amazed at what a difference it makes..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.) Once your done ripping all the hair out, your skin will be irritated, have a slight to moderate burning sensation and may have little red blotches on it. ITS NORMAL... You just traumatized your skin so remember that and this type of hair removal isn&#x27;t for sissy la-la&#x27;s either so please do not post your horrifying sissy-fied reviews on here about how horrible it is; your pulling hair out from its bulb its par for the course.. BUT the great news is that the hair that does grow back will grow back finer and finer and with less and less coming back all together.... Which for me is a no brainer...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, if there is ONE MAJOR TIP I can give you to keep your skin that you epilate and well your entire body for that matter it is is: EXFOLIATE daily with a good set of exfoliation gloves and your choice of good soap and body scrub.... The primary reason people get ingrown hairs so badly is that they do not exfoliate daily and its a necessary evil in order to maintain great skin and even better epilated skin and you may just fall in love with your skin all over again once you begin this necessity just like I have for decades...r /&gt;3.) For underarms do not epilate when you have deoderant on. It drags along the skin and you will miss alot of the hair your intending to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.) Take an Ibuprofen or tylenol or pain reducer of your choice an hour before you do it if your sensitive to things like this or have a low tolerance to pain you&#x27;ll be amazed at what a difference it makes..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.)

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about half a year now -- and I love it. This is my #1 go-to epilator because it gets the job done, and well. I love that it doesn&#x27;t require batteries, and that it can be used wet or dry. Additionally, the shaving head (second attachment) is quite useful as well, and used nearly as frequently as the epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as pain is concerned -- that&#x27;s just the nature of epilators in general. While some can endure it better than others, know that it does become less painful with use. Make sure the hair you&#x27;re epilating isn&#x27;t too long (the instructions include an approximate length) and this should reduce some of the pain, as well as breakage.</li>
    <li> Used prior to my vacation in feb 2013....worked great. ..but have been dealing with horrible ingrown hairs ever since....it is now aug 2013 and I still have ingrown hairs...never had a problem before I used this product....</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. it has done wonders for me especially on underarm use as I have a problem with normal razors leaving a dark shadow.</li>
    <li> It works great. It&#x27;s much easier to use than the old one I had.</li>
    <li> I received this item a few days ago and promptly tried to use it.  First, I have a high threshold for pain, I&#x27;ve been getting Brazilian&#x27;s for years, so the pain associated with pulling out hair was not that bad.  My issue with this garbage is that despite following the directions (using it at a 90 degree angle, putting soap in it to help it glide, softening the hair with warm shower water, making sure the hair was the right length) it doesn&#x27;t pull out the hair. I&#x27;m not particularly hairy - I went over the same patch on my shin 5-6 times and still half of the hair was there.  I tried it on my bikini line - it broke the hair off at the skin level.  I get better results with a razor (and less aggravation).  My underarms - ten minutes each to get 75% of the hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have to see about returning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I have  thick, coarse hair that grows super fast and is sensitive skin. Not a great combination for keeping smooth legs. I&#x27;ve tried practically every razor on the market, every cream, waxing... Nothing gets me smooth for longer than a day (if it removes the hair at all).&lt;br /&gt;This thing is a miracle. It&#x27;s a bit painful at first, more than laser hair treatments but less than waxing. But, you certainly adjust to the sensation after a little time and before long you&#x27;re doing your bikini line while watching the tube.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m left with some redness afterward, but that dissipates with in a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used it on my face, so much faster than plucking and I didn&#x27;t need a magnifying mirror to see.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s taken me three full charges and I&#x27;m not quite through with my entire body, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve used an epilator, so I&#x27;m sure it will go much faster in the future when there isn&#x27;t such a forest to beat down. (Yeah, I&#x27;m hairy...)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed some reviewers saying that shorter hair is better... and, while I don&#x27;t think it needs to be as long as it should be for waxing, a little longer seems to hurt less for me.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I suggest exfoliating a day or so before to loosen any hairs that might be held closer to the skin... and after you have used it, in the shower, to reduce the likelihood that you get ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Further more, I like using it dry. Seems like it removed the hair much more easily and my skin was less sensitive. But, that&#x27;s my own preference.</li>
    <li> The old model was fantastic. Had it for seven years, never a problem, used everyday. This one was the newest version of my old one. I use it on my chin/armpits. It pulls a few hairs, but breaks all the rest. It&#x27;s not as good of an epilator. I&#x27;m disappointed. Haven&#x27;t shopped around because I don&#x27;t want to spend 100&#x27;s to find the best one. Any recommendations?</li>
    <li> it works all right, but the battery doesn&#x27;t last much and you can&#x27;t use it when it&#x27;s plugged in to recharge. Not the best epilator I&#x27;ve had, but good enough for its price</li>
    <li> I am hispanic and have Polysistic Ovarian Syndrome which causes more hair and I take a hair skin and nails multi vitamin so I am very hairy and have tried everything under the sun as I know many other women have as well. I purchased the panasonic because I thought it was a good price and amazon has an excellent return and customer service police. needless to say I just love this product first few times it took some getting used to but now it is effortless and stingless altho I still shave my girl part as once was enough there it is quick painless and I can even do it in the car while my husband is driving I love the way it makes my arms and legs feel and it is great for my chin and neck area and quick too thumbs up to this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver as a gift. The recipient reports it works great and she is delighted with it.  The price was right, and Amazon.com sent it to me very fast.</li>
    <li> I purchased this a few weeks ago, I have used it couple of times.So far I am satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> I returned this product as it was a little to rough for me to use.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for an year...And its perfect I say!!!!!! And compared to razor this is much much better.. And you feel it so comfortable and soft....just last ve this product.And now I could save loads of money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE BEEN SHAVING MY LEGS FOR ALMOST 50 YEARS &amp; I NEVER FOUND A PRODUCT THAT DID A BETTER JOB.  BE PREPARED FOR A VERY HIGH LEVEL OF PAIN AT FIRST, BUT IT HURTS LESS AFTER A FEW PASSES &amp; THE RESULTS LAST A LONG, LONG TIME.</li>
    <li> When I bought this epilator (my first), I was bound and determined that it would work! I started by using the beginner&#x27;s guard, which is definitely a good idea, but I was frustrated because I had to let the hair grow out for it to reach and there was still stubble! Also, my skin was irritated. Finally, I became brave and took off the guard and used the epilator straight on, and it could get sooo close, so I didn&#x27;t have to let the hair grow long, and I had a super smooth finish that lasted a long time. I think if you start out using this with a \\&quot;it will work because it&#x27;s supposed to and I want it to\\&quot; attitude, you won&#x27;t be disappointed! It DOES work, it just takes some getting used to!</li>
    <li> This is my first time using an epilator. I ordered this one because of the rave reviews. I have dark, coarse hair and very light skin, so my leg hair is very noticeable. The first time I used it, I let my leg hair grow out to just over 1/4 inch. I wanted to make sure there was enough hair for it to grab and pull. I used it in the shower as directed, using moisturizing body wash. Let me say this - it DID remove the hair. But I had to make 20 passes over 1 patch of skin the get all the hair off, and it hurt like hell. Having to make so many passes really doesn&#x27;t save any time at all. Maybe it is because my hair is so thick? It seems like shaving is a quicker, less painful way to take care of hair. I have to say I&#x27;m disappointed because I&#x27;ve been so sick of shaving all these years and wanted a better alternative. Time to look for something new.</li>
    <li> I had never really heard of epilators before, and I&#x27;ve been shaving for years. I&#x27;m always on the lookout for something better than shaving for my underarms, and I came across a recommendation online. I came on Amazon, found this item, and ordered it ... feeling quite skeptical because of the negative-leaning reviews. I used it pretty much as soon as it was out of the box, and tried it again in the shower. Here are my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. It works great - it gets the hairs out real quick. I&#x27;ve been plucking (yes, individual hairs with tweezers) and shaving, and I ended up shaving because of convenience, speed and lack of pain. The pain was so brief - within a minute of epilation I didn&#x27;t feel it anymore, though my skin turned red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s fast. I&#x27;m going to be using this on my upper lip too ... though I&#x27;ll keep it away from my eyebrows :P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Great with shaving foam in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. It doesn&#x27;t get every hair, but even though this isn&#x27;t a reason to dislike it, it&#x27;s enough to not earn it that last star. Even with obvious hairs that I thought it could have gotten, it didn&#x27;t get. Not that it&#x27;s a big deal to manually pluck out three hairs, but this really should have gotten them. This is the only reason why it&#x27;s great, not amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Don&#x27;t use it dry. It didn&#x27;t work as well for me. Others may have a different experience, but I&#x27;m only going to be using this wet and in the shower with my shaving foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first epilator, and I have to say I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used epilators for years because my skin is very sensitive to shave gels and creams.  The Panasonic took too long to charge and did not work well dry.  I needed to remove the guard for it to work.  I eventually gave up and used it wet with shave gel.  While that seemed to work(again without the guard)it very quickly lost it&#x27;s charge and eventually just quit charging. I&#x27;ve only had it about 18 months. One other thing, in the instructions it says not to use it before, during, or after your period??? Um, it&#x27;s always before, during, or after my period until I hit menopause! I&#x27;m going to go back to the Emjoi Epilator.</li>
    <li> I got this specifically b/c I was sick of paying for bikini and brazilian waxes just to have them look ridiculous growing out and getting ingrown hairs in the process so I wanted to try something else specifically for that area. Pain wise- it&#x27;s exactly like being waxed except that it doesn&#x27;t all come off at once, so you get more freaked out than anything and you are dealing with a longer period of time in which the hairs are being pulled out. Effective wise- it definitely gets the hair out at the roots and everything is smooth, but it can&#x27;t get all the hairs at once and I&#x27;ve had trouble getting to some, ah, more concealed areas of odd directions of hair growth. Can&#x27;t speak to the ingrown hair issue yet but be sure I will update if this becomes an issue. Overall, I think I&#x27;ll have to keep waxing to get everything off at once, but the epilady is definitely pretty cool for touch ups and expanded bikini line only hair removal. Doesn&#x27;t solve all my lady parts + bikini wearing hair problems at once but definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research on line before I purchased this particular epilator. I was excited to try it and I feel like I got great results. the attachments are nice because you can just use it as an electric razor/bikinni trimmer. The epilator does hurt but it isn&#x27;t too terrible. I followed others advice and shaved the day before I used it, this seems to help with the pain because it is still pulling the hair out but becuase the hair is shorter it doesn&#x27;t hurt so bad. I haven&#x27;t used it wet, I would think that would be difficult just because I tend to putt the skill tight and if it was wet I would think that would be difficult to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it I did it a few days in a row, mostly while watching tv. some areas were more painful than others. but the results were worth it. If I felt my leg I could feel a small amount of hair or &amp;#34;fuzz&amp;#34; but nothing compared to what my legs would have looked like before. We were on vacation for an entire week and I only shaved my legs once becuase I was worried they weren&#x27;t smooth enough, but in all honesty, I probably didn&#x27;t even need to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can tolerate the pain in the beginning it is so worth the results. I didn&#x27;t try the armpit area yet so can&#x27;t get my opinion on that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It stays charged a really long time so that is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I love this thing. It&#x27;s worked way better than my last Remington epilator with much less pain. :)&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a new epilator after my last one broke. I almost went back to the remington but came across this one and noticed it was cheaper with good reviews. I took the chance and bought it, and i&#x27;m glad i did ^^. Little pain, waterproof, cord less..and in my opinion worth the good price.</li>
    <li> Went through a lot of reviews on different epillator, then went through all reviews for the panasonic wet/dry epilator and then went and ordered the same.&lt;br /&gt;Works great!!! I have been using it for about 6 months now.  The epilator moves slowly and is less painful than other epilators that i used.  Added factor it can be used when its wet...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only pblm i see that we have to wait for it to get recharged before using, it cannot be used when plugged in</li>
    <li> I used my first epilator when I was 17 years old, and it was my mothers, so I hadn&#x27;t used one since, but when I saw this offered as a &amp;#34;lightning deal&amp;#34; on Amazon, I thought I would give it a try again because I HATE shaving my legs.  The first time that I used it, it was very painful, and I had to take several breaks because of the pain.  For those of you that have had tattoos, I would describe the sensation very similar to that.  I have now used it several times, and I only find myself wincing once or twice when doing my entire leg area (mostly down my the ankles).  I am very happy with the results, I am finding that the hair grows back lighter and less course, and obviously can go a lot longer in between &amp;#34;treatments&amp;#34; than I could while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have the wet/dry feature, although I cannot review on the wet because I haven&#x27;t used it.  The charging doesn&#x27;t take very long, and I would say that mine lasts more than an hour on a single charge.  I love that it is cordless also!</li>
    <li> I loved this epilator! I used to have Braun Silk Epil which hurt so much that I went back to waxing. The Panasonic ES-WD51-P didn&#x27;t hurt much. I even epilated my underarms instead of shaving them. I must mention that I&#x27;m very hairy but didn&#x27;t have full growth when I used it. I would certainly recommended it to other women.</li>
    <li> I happened upon this model while browsing Groupon one night. I&#x27;d never even heard of epilators much less ever used one. But I decided to give it a whirl. It was only $40. I have to say I am very impressed. It literally paid for itself after just one use. Regular Brazilian waxes were costing me $50 every few weeks! I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s definitely worth the investment! I had initially purchased it as an alternative to shaving my legs. But after a week or two of trial and error, I decided epilating my legs is not for me. The amount of time required to maintain smooth legs just wasn&#x27;t worth it. Plus having to exfoliate my calves every shower to avoid ingrown hairs &amp; bumps? No thanks... I could just use that time to shave. However, I have found it a blessing for getting rid of underarm hair. It&#x27;s amazing! Takes just a few seconds to get smooth underarms that last for over a week! Yesssssssssss! One less thing to worry about!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many people reading these reviews are probably wondering about the level of pain involved... I will say... it&#x27;s its own special brand of torture. lol Epilating my underarms doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. My lady bits area on the other hand.... sweet baby Jesus. Waxing is so much easier, faster, &amp; less painful. But I&#x27;m a total cheap ass. I can now get the same results (if not better results) at home. For FREE. I no longer have to plan &amp; make appointments. I have control over my vagina! HAHAHA!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all seriousness though, I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> its a nice devise but overall it doesnt really pull out the hair, it only snags it and cuts off and its very painful. the description says it leaves your skin feeling soft for more then a week but it only last two days since it doesnt really pull out the entire hair.</li>
    <li> I really like the shaver head. You can get a close shave with it. Got to get use to the epilator head. Glad it had more than one head to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Panasonic Epilator for a while now and I can safely say the pain gets better with time and hair thinner. I used to shave and have allergies so I prefer the epilator. I live in Brazil and waxing is kinda expensive, so the epilator has already paid itself many times so far. I used it on my legs and under arms. You should buy it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, this is my second epilator. Years ago I used that one, the most popular and little, but this is much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck!! :)</li>
    <li> There is nothing like the original Epilady. Worked great but now hard to find.  It never broke the skin.  This one will sometimes&lt;br /&gt;cut, pinch, &amp;  draw blood.  I loved my original Epilady it was perfect but it eventually stopped working.  Also this design causes&lt;br /&gt;it to be difficult to get into all areas.  It&#x27;s like a torture device. You&#x27;ll be fine then ouch!!!</li>
    <li> Painful but worth it. So much better than having to shave every other day! Which can take a toll on your skin :( The machine came in its original package and functions properly. The only downside is that it runs out of battery pretty quickly. I&#x27;m relatively hairy (sorry if tmi) and if I use this on both my legs and underarm, by the time I&#x27;m finished, I need to start charging it back up again. But overall it does its deed. The grip is sturdy, the color is nice, and it comes with accessories that makes traveling with it helpful.</li>
    <li> I have a shaving allergy so I&#x27;m forced to use an electric shaver. I get terrible ingrown hairs as well so I can&#x27;t speak for the epilator part of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to get a good enough shave, you have to go over the same area more than 10 times. I lost count after that. This shaver is also really hard to clean. I&#x27;ve done everything I can to clean the inside crevices, but I&#x27;m still left with black crap inside of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only good thing about this is that it holds a charge really well. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this, just buy a men&#x27;s electric shaver instead! Use this one for shaving- [[ASIN:B005DKKBRY Panasonic ES-LT41-K Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades, Black/Silver]]</li>
    <li> It works good but I am disappointed that you can&#x27;t use it on your face, which is why I bought it in the first place. I will keep it for my arms &amp; legs.</li>
    <li> After waiting for almost 20 years to get a new epilator because I old one broke, I was so excited when I found this product.  I like that it is cordless and takes very little time to charge up.  However, I feel that it is not as effective in hair removal as my old unit was.  For the price it is adequate.</li>
    <li> This thing is so not worth purchasing unless you like pain then this is perfect for you.A little hard to figure out but does work but you will bleed and be in PAIN!</li>
    <li> I never leave a review, but I was honestly so blown away that I felt I should write one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to have a Panasonic epilator that just broke (I have had it for 8 years now!) and I was scared to try out a different brand. So I went with this model and I must say I was really impressed by it. It removes hair fast (it has so many tweezers!), and it involves the least amount of pain it can possibly involve (remember it will always hurt a little because you are not shaving, you are removing the hair by its root). It is easy to clean, and it is very gentle on your skin. It removes hair that has just started growing and you don&#x27;t have to go over the same spot multiple times in order to remove all the hair. It also adapts very well to areas that are hard to reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, AH-MAZING is all I can say. I purchased two (one for my mom) and I don&#x27;t regret it at all!</li>
    <li> The machine works only by charging it, that&#x27;s why it works only for 45 minutes and the you have to charge it again.&lt;br /&gt;It only have one speed and its not that strong, do it take me longer time to finish comparing to my old machine</li>
    <li> I bought many items locally from the store, but neither one was as good as this one. Of course there were a pain when using it, but not that much, all the mechanics must causes a pain, but this one has less pain. Thanks</li>
    <li> This was my first epilator and first experience with an epilator.  It is true that epilating is painful but you get used to it.  My skin is really sensitive to shaving on my legs, waxing is too expensive and you have to wait too long between sessions, and depilatories don&#x27;t dissolve my leg hair.  This has been a great alternative, lasts much longer than shaving.  I do get red bumps in some areas after doing it but I find that putting aloe vera on after epilating really helps prevent that.</li>
    <li> Ok this hurt like hell and left my skin with bruise and scabbs. I will not use the epilator attachment as it really did hurt. Yes it took out my hair but my leg was scabbed, red and hurt a lot. I used the regular shaver attachment and liked that much better, no pain and got rid of hair quick.</li>
    <li> Bought it few months ago worked good only used it dry skin but and every two weeks or so but now it is not as  powerful as it was when i got it .</li>
    <li> Ok, I feel the pain- I see some hairs clearly pulled out- but there is still so much hair on my body~ I tried everywhere- and I got very mixed results. The worse part- I think I have ingrown hairs popping up everywhere now!&lt;br /&gt;I liked the shaver part- then after two weeks (which is the day I got it)- it STOPPED working! Won&#x27;t even charge!! What gives! The reviews are amazing- but this doesn&#x27;t make sense!</li>
    <li> Holy cow. I bought an Epilady back in the 1980&#x27;s and had it for 25 years. It worked, but I had to use it every two weeks, and it was a little uncomfortable because I could feel the hairs being pulled. This Panasonic epilator is COMPLETELY pain-free (I have no idea how that&#x27;s possible, but it is) and I only have to use it once a month! (Note: I only use it below the knee, so I don&#x27;t know if it would be pain-free above the knee.)</li>
    <li> My old epilator was about 10 years old. It hurt every time I used it. It was not wireless and only for dry use. After it broke, I bought this one. This is a totally new experience! It almost doesn&#x27;t hurt to use it. I love that it is wireless, it is much easier to use. And you can even use it while showering! I also love the added razor, very convenient! Totally worth the money.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product, but found it to be pretty painful. I only actually did the lower part on one leg and had to stop (there is no way anyone on here is using this on their bikini area, NO WAY!), and I am no wimp, I&#x27;ve have gotten two tattoos and one removed. So, for now I have put this away in my bathroom cabinet, and have returned to shaving. I may attempt to use this again, once I have forgotten what it felt like (that&#x27;s how I wound up having a second child). I don&#x27;t think I would reccommend this product, perhaps someone who has never shaved their legs and has thinner hair would have a better experience.</li>
    <li> I purposely waited a year to review this product to see how it would hold up.  It has worked well. It&#x27;s not as powerful as my old Epilady but still does a good job. I use it to epilate my legs, arms and underarms. I used it on my face a couple of times, but even with exfoliating before and the day after, it left me with ingrown hairs - probably just my skin type. I am able to epilate my legs and arms and sometimes underarms included, in one charge.  Speaking of charging, it does it pretty quickly.  I have epilated before with a different product,  so I am used to the \\&quot;pain\\&quot; which definitely subsides with time(to more like quick pinches). The key is to exfoliate before, and to hold the skin taut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see that their is a new version of the Epiglide(which includes a light and other attachments), maybe I will try that one next.</li>
    <li> I bought this product about a year ago and since then it has worked perfectly for me. I have used it every week and it still works like the first day I got it. The only problem is you can not use it when it is on charge (like braun or other brands) and if you forgot to put it on charge the last time you used it, then you should wait for more than half an hour for it to be charged. but it&#x27;s not a big deal. I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I used to use hot wax. One day I spilled the hot wax on my hand and got a second degree burn. After this I decided to try something new. I have only tried this on my bikini area and ouch! I did end up going back to the wax because burn or no burn the wax is much more tolerable. However, I will say that there are certain areas, like closer to the thigh, that aren&#x27;t as painful as other areas that are. I use this still on the not so painful areas and the wax on the other parts.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I love the fact I can use it dry or wet. It doesn&#x27;t hurt too much and is easy to use. Plus it keeps a long charge and it doesn&#x27;t take long to charge it. I would really recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have a high pain tolerance and this REALLY REALLY hurt the first time. However, ladies, if you make it through one cycle (I took breaks and it took me 2 days to do all of my legs) I promise it will never hurt like that again. I like to use it every other day on my legs. If you keep up with it, you are only ripping a few hairs out at a time and that doesn&#x27;t hurt at all and it doesn&#x27;t take long.  My advice: even if you think your skin is tight, pull it more taught- it makes it so much less painful. Move the epilator in multiple directions to catch all the hairs. Exfoliate using a loofah and try to epilate after showers. I have done my legs, arms, and some bikini area. I like that the unit holds a charge nicely- I have not had it die on me yet. I can not use a razor to shave.  I have really sensitive skin on my legs but they hold up well to the epilation. I hate my electric razor because it takes forever and a day later you can&#x27;t wear a skirt or shorts in public. I have not let the hair grow for two weeks between epilation yet, yes, because I am scared that if I do it will hurt like the first time. But I think you could probably make it close to two weeks and still be able to look mostly hairless. I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Why not.  I am a waxer and have been for a long time and wanted to try this route of hair removal instead.  Well it does do what it says it does but I almost find it more painful then waxing.  I guess its because when you pull a strip with wax off you grab a bunch of hair at once, and using an epilator you can feel every hair being pulled out like a real fast tweezers lol.  Although I plan to stick to waxing I do use my epilator if my hair is finely growing back in and still too short to wax this lil guy has got u covered because it will grab the smallest piece of hair there is.  I love this product it was def worth the price.  It hurts a lot less after you use it several times and it feels better when you use it in the shower.</li>
    <li> Wasted money, didnt work.</li>
    <li> I Did not liked it . It hurts and I do not feel it does the job.. I do not think the pain is worth it if is not going to work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really stumped on this item.  I have tried to get it to epilate several times.  I have read and reread the instructions.  It isn&#x27;t taking the hair off.  I put on the shaver head and that worked but that is not what I paid for.  I&#x27;m perplexed and disappointed in this and will return it.  Also when I was trying to epilate, it hurt to high heaven.  Imagine the disbelief that so much pain resulted in almost no hair gone!!</li>
    <li> I tried this products on my legs first.  I was surprised it didn&#x27;t hurt.  But after I was done I saw tons of hairs that were broken instead of removed.  I returned it.</li>
    <li> I read the raving reviews, it worked for the first month and then the razor stopped working.  I attempted to return it within the policy period, but they were out of stock and exchange it.  Now I&#x27;m stuck with this unreliable piece of equipment.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be very painful, but it&#x27;s really not.  You can feel a little bit of pulling, but not much.  I even use it on my underarms.  And I love not having to shave often, like I used to.  Wish I would&#x27;ve gotten this a long time ago.</li>
    <li> It is a pretty good epilator. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it hurts a little.</li>
    <li> It works great, fast and is cheap! It is my first epilator and must say that it is not painful at all! I meant it just hurt a little be...</li>
    <li> but, it was just pulling hair out by the roots.  Exactly what I bought it to do!  Mind you, I was doing the underarm area, so I was probably particularly sensitive there.  It&#x27;s been almost a couple weeks, and I&#x27;m still pretty hair-free.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.  Comes with a shaver head as well, for areas that are too sensitive for the epilator.  Battery life outlasted my ability to withstand the pain, so no problem there.  I&#x27;m sure after a couple of times, I&#x27;ll toughen up a bit.  And, I will be using it.</li>
    <li> it works as described, easy to use, like the rechargeable function.&lt;br /&gt;but it&#x27;s quite painful on the arms, don&#x27;t even try it on the armpit...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really nice and convenient and the best thing I like about it is that it&#x27;s not that noisy. Great!</li>
    <li> I have had this for about 10 days now.  I took the advise of other reviews and shaved before using it.  The first day didn&#x27;t really hurt at all, but there were not many hairs long enough for it to grab.  The second day hurt a little bit, but not bad.  Then I waited a few days and tried ago.  A little pain, but again not bad.  Each time I used it, there were a few more hairs that had grown out long enough to grab.  And each time, my legs felt smoother.  They are almost smooth now.  It does seem to miss some hairs, but I just try to go over that area again in a different direction to try to grab them.  It seems that hair an your legs grows in all different directions.  I really like it so far, and am having to use it less often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried my underarms, and that was painful.  Still shaving there for now, and will work my way up to it.  I haven&#x27;t really done the bikini area either.  Mostly just legs for now.  I like it so far.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t actually seem to pull hair out, just pull it. It&#x27;s frustrating to use as I have to go over the same patch of skin 20+ times, and each time hurts just as much as the first and pulls out, I dunno, like 5 hairs? Seriously. Directions followed to the T and I used it on a relatively &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; area of the body for my initial test (my outside forearms) and I gotta say, this thing is basically useless unless you like having your hair pulled but not pulled out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dunno, it just doesn&#x27;t work anything like I had expected, and is incredibly inefficient. Two stars for being an affordable mistake, and having a razor trim attachment, since I can at least still get some use out of that, I guess.</li>
    <li> good for the price .  Neat for travel . I can use it easily .  No rash and bump no more</li>
    <li> I so love this device. I bought this a year ago and I am in love with it. At first it was painful but I got use to the pain. Now it doesn&#x27;t hurt anymore and I have less thick hair that is growing under my armpit and the dark area I use to have is almost completely gone plus I use salt deodorant which helps a lot. Buy this product u won&#x27;t regret it.  I will not go back shaving my armpits and legs.</li>
    <li> This was painful and expensive.  And, painfully expensive. I&#x27;ll just continue to shave my legs with a razor so I can at least enjoy a night out.</li>
    <li> I used this on my legs so far.  Using it with the cover without lotion I got break off of hairs.  Remove the cover and use some body gel, and it works like a charm!  If you have waxed, you know pulling out hairs by the roots is going to hurt, but you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first used this, it felt like prickles.  However, rather quickly, I was going over my lower legs, happy I don&#x27;t have to mess with waxing now!  This works a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing to remember is that pulling out the hair causes the skin to swell.  So you want to go slowly enough to get all the hairs the first time, or the shortest ones end up hidden by the skin. And go against the direction the hair is growing in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this epilator.  48 tweezers definitely makes things go faster.</li>
    <li> After I received my Epilator, i was disappointed. It said about many tweezers, but they don&#x27;t work and grab hair like supposed to. Im using it twice longer and more often than my old one. I actually miss my old one from Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was not a problem, one thing the seller didn&#x27;t include return label and I couldn&#x27;t return it.&lt;br /&gt;Im not happy with that product at all.</li>
    <li> The product came on time as promised and in great condition. But the product itself wasn&#x27;t effective for me. It really really hurts! and it doesn&#x27;t get rid of all your hair. You have to use it like 20 times on the same spot to get rid of it, which hurts and takes forever! So just to get one leg done it takes more than an hour!</li>
    <li> I have never used an Epilator before and was very unsure if I would like it or if it was painfull.  Well I can tell you this is amazing!!! The feeling was very small compared to the excellant result I got.  This is so much easier than shaving and your legs will be smooth as silk. I highly recommend this product!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this epilator. It&#x27;s easy to use, gentle on the skin and works well. It&#x27;s a great replacement for a 15 or more-year old Braun epilady that I had.</li>
    <li> I love using this epilator because it gets rid of hair that&#x27;s short too, and does so quickly and with minimal pain. The pink color is girly and cute and the battery lasts really long. I have to fully charge it only about twice a month and I use it about 1-2 times a week, depending on my hair growth. Once, I fully charged it and took it on a month long vacation and it worked the entire vacation. It&#x27;s a great handy little device that makes removing underarm hair easy and virtually pain-free and hassle free.</li>
    <li> The dual-head optimizes the experience as it pulls more hair in less time. It&#x27;s also a lot less painful than other epilators I&#x27;ve tried. The shaver head is PAINFUL; I use my old epilator for trimming since this one tends to snag your hairs.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews before I bought this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because we moved to Florida and it seemed like I always needed everything shaved at all times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I read them all and I did follow the one that said first time use in the tub. I found it not that bad. I am a natural redhead and all things skin related seem to hurt or leave a mark. I did have scabs the next day but overall way happy. I bought this in the summer. Now in Fl we have extreme humidity and rain and my skin was very moist. Now that it is winter, it is harder to use.  My skin is dry right now and the hairs don&#x27;t want to come out, they are growing under the skin when they regrow, I go no where near the bikini line right now. I hope to be able to use it in the summer again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The secret to being happy with this machine lies with moisturizer and exfoliation. You need the skin ready to go before this will work. Daily moisturizer and a light exfoliation are a must. With shaving you get that exfoliation treatment, without it you get a build up. I use plain old baking soda and use it generously. And keep it clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t perfect, it didn&#x27;t reduce the amount of time I need to invest in my legs. But it has been amazing for my underarms. I wear tank tops almost all the time and no more 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest con is that when my hair has regrown on my legs it went back to that baby fine blonde hair I had growing up and the machine doesn&#x27;t like to grab those as easy as the darker thicker hairs.</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator. I was plucking before and it took forever. I kept seeing this in the store and I decided to research. I found out that these machines did what I was doing, but much faster. I researched which one to get and I decided on this one. When I received it I charged it. When it was fully charged I turned it on, I was hesitant because I was scared to try it. I ended up just going for it. It hurt, but I already assumed it was going hurt. I like it a lot. I don&#x27;t regret buying it, I actually recommend it. I think no matter which epilator you buy it is going to hurt. It comes with instructions so follow them. I use it once a week and my hairs are tamed. lol It does not take me a long time to epilate.</li>
    <li> I like that this epilator is cordless and therefore very handy, and you can use it in the shower. I don&#x27;t like the speed, because I have feeling that my previous, ancient one was doing the job much faster. And I don&#x27;t like that my skin sometimes gets very irritated with pimples and that never happened to me before.</li>
    <li> I understand that you need to use an epilator a few times to get used to the feeling, but it hurt so much I couldn&#x27;t get past the first half of my leg. I tried doing it after a hot shower/bath and during a hot shower, no luck. It would pull out 1/3 of the hairs. Then, after a couple of days, huge ingrown red bumps would appear. I use the trimmer function now, which works very well...but the epilator was far too painful for me. I consider myself to have a high pain tolerance, too.</li>
    <li> i got this at ulta because it was my first time shaving. It did not take ANY hair off! I am doing it correctly. My legs are very hairy and its so embarsing! WORST EVER!!!!!!!!!!Never buy this! It is horrible!</li>
    <li> While vacationing in Cozumel, I met a woman who raved about her Epilady and the fact that after using it for years, she now shaves her legs only a couple of times a year.  After this endorsement and some price checks, I decided to go with this model. Though there&#x27;s a newer model, this one seemed to have comparable features and was about half the price.  It&#x27;s pretty straightforward to use.  Just turn it on and hold it at a 90 degree angle to your skin surface.  I used it immediately after showering and haven&#x27;t tried it in the shower.  It seems to work well while the pores are open and skin is hydrated.  Surprisingly, it wasn&#x27;t as painful as some reviewers have described.  It feels a little pinchy &amp; burnie.  My legs were shaved the day before, so the hair wasn&#x27;t long and my hair is fairly fine. When I&#x27;ve finished my legs don&#x27;t feel 100% smooth.  Slather on some body cream to sooth the tingling.  Next day, your legs will feel much smoother. So far I&#x27;ve used it three times in the past two weeks.  My legs stay smoother for days longer as compared to shaving.  Hopefully with time I&#x27;ll be shaving less &amp; less.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and thought, &amp;#34;Oh, this will be the best epilator ever!&amp;#34; Wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but it will turn your skin to ground beef in the process.</li>
    <li> I have bought Panasonic epilators for six years now and I&#x27;m on my third one. The key with using an epilator is not forcing it into your skin. If you do that, it will grip more than just the hair and will give you burn rash/ scars. Keep it light and easily glide it over the skin. If it doesn&#x27;t grab a hair, pull your skin upwards to give the tweezers room to go under the hair growth and grab it. Don&#x27;t blame the epilator, learn to use it properly.</li>
    <li> I saw a video on YouTube about epilators and decided I needed to look into this s&#x27;more: I was so intrigued. So I watched several other videos and then read the reviews on Amazon. I decided to buy this model because it was corded -- I didn&#x27;t want to have to keep buying batteries. Also, it has a razor attachment, which is perfect for trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I got this in the mail, I charged this bad boy up and went right for it. Sure, it wasn&#x27;t completely pleasant, but nothing too bad. For my legs, the sensitive areas were around my ankles and my upper thighs -- owie! My underarms were a piece of cake. It takes a bit of time, especially for the first use -- because you&#x27;re playing catch-up and trying to rip everything out in one sitting. But after you&#x27;ve done the initial session, it&#x27;s just a matter of maintenance. It&#x27;s kinda fun, too. Call me weird, but I&#x27;ll just sit in bed and epilate for a bit before I go to bed. It&#x27;s not too loud, so you can easily watch TV at the same time. Love it.</li>
    <li> The Good:&lt;br /&gt;- This epilator is thorough and especially if you use it after a shower, it&#x27;s not so painful that it&#x27;s unbearable. It WILL be painful, it is after all ripping out lots of hairs at once, but if you have ever waxed, it&#x27;s sort of a similar situation: the more you do it, the easier it seems to get.&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;- Able to be used anywhere (due to cordless capability and wet/dry)&lt;br /&gt;- Fast and efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s few things I don&#x27;t really like about it. And they aren&#x27;t really enough to make me care very much. But maybe these things would matter to someone else:&lt;br /&gt;- Can&#x27;t use it when it is plugged into the charger (which means, if the battery isn&#x27;t charged, you just aren&#x27;t able to use it at all, and you have to wait for it charge). It&#x27;s kind of inconvenient at times.&lt;br /&gt;- No LED light (this is kind of a luxury that I&#x27;ve seen on other models, which I think would be a nice added &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; but it still does a great job without it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I can&#x27;t speak for:&lt;br /&gt;Using it DURING a shower (I&#x27;ve had some people tell me that it is less painful that way, but I can&#x27;t really speak for that), the longevity of the unit (especially the battery, since that is the only method of operation).</li>
    <li> I have recently become unable to safely use a regular razor.  This helps me SO much and it very easy and not painful at all. I use the Epiglide and the Shaver attachment with easy.</li>
    <li> I used this for the first  time today, my initial impression is, I like it. It didn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much as everyone says, maybe I&#x27;m just not all that sensitive. My legs are mostly smooth except for the areas where the hair wasn&#x27;t quite long enough to pull out. Some parts of my leg hair grow fast, other parts slow. I did my pits too, and I am very pleased with those. When I shave under my arms, I usually end up with really bad razor irritation that burns and leaves little bumps. It hurt a little but nothing compared to the horrific burning that I get with shaving. It was hard to pull the skin tight in my pits, and I found that I had some moisture which created an uncomfortable drag. I remedied that by using a dime size amount of anti-chafing gel and waited for it to dry. Then, smooth sailing! All in all, I think I really like it. Hopefully it holds up to regular use. If I have any issues, I will come back to report.</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator.  The way some reviewers were going on about the pain, I thought this was going to be worse than child birth.  While it does hurt, it&#x27;s not that bad.  I guess everyone is different.  I did soak in a tub of warm water first, so maybe that helped.  I was even was able to use it in my genital area with only some pain and discomfort.  The only problem is you have to go over and over the same area of skin for it get all the hairs, and I still wound up having to use a razor afterwards to get the hair that was missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even so, the hair that the epilator does catch DOES take a long time to grow back, which is the whole reason why I bought this thing.  I&#x27;m tired of having to shave every other day, so for that reason I like the device.  I didn&#x27;t want to invest too much money into this product since I&#x27;ve never used one before, but now I know I can handle the pain I might go for a more pricier version.</li>
    <li> This device was for a good friend, not for me. She wrote the following, \\&quot;This thing does not pull hair at all. I have few hair on my legs, but have to move this epilator back and forth few minutes to catch these hair. I am disappointed.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> actually i didn&#x27;t use it.however it looks like good and i will use it recently, i hope that it will likes the introduction as well</li>
    <li> I am using just as a razor right now, but I did try the epilator. It works well! I was scared, but it mostly feels like tiny electric shocks, nothing too painful.</li>
    <li> This is just okay. It is expensive, so I&#x27;m not as happy as I should be with this purchase, but it is okay and I can say that it&#x27;s durable.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product. It works best on my lower legs and its kinda painful and scary to use elsewhere. The finer hairs on my thigh break in the process which causes nasty ingrown hairs so I avoid the area. Although it doesnt get everything in one run it has allowed me to go without shaving everyday. I bought it on a &amp;#34;today&#x27;s deals&amp;#34; and it has been well worth it.</li>
    <li> I did much comparing before I bought this but found it to be too weak an epilator to give it a good rating. All the attachments kept popping off as I was using them and I found myself reattaching them every few seconds. Even without the attachments I feel there is limited power and therfore hard to obtain a smooth hair removal. I&#x27;m currently looking for another model that offers a better outcome.</li>
    <li> I do not like that it&#x27;s painful and does not remove all hairs that it should.&lt;br /&gt;Do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping, it was shipped the same day and I received it days before it was due. I suffer from very thick and embarrassing facial hair. I have tried everything and what I USE to do was tweeze the hairs individually which took an easy 45 minutes. Its disgusting but true. My parents must have been Chewbacca and Cousin It. Seriously. Thank God for Panasonic, because I was able to epilate all of my facial hair in under 5 minutes. It took a while since the hair is thick but for anyone that suffers from light peach fuzz this will work in 2 minutes I imagine. This is a new life line to normal face to hair ratio. A must buy.&lt;br /&gt;Also the fact that it is wet/dry makes it a lot less painful.</li>
    <li> The epilator hurt bad. It rips the hair out so fast it leaves bumps. The only redeeming thing is the foil shaver head.</li>
    <li> The motor works, it pulls hair, it just doesn&#x27;t pull hair out of the follicle.  So, I get the pain of having my hairs pulled hard, just no benefit of having it removed.  Maybe my hair is too fine.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. Although it does hurt a bit, the pain is very manageable. After using this product for some time now, I have noticed that my leg hair is growing thinner and it takes it much longer to grow. The product is also very convenient, since it is cordless you can remove hair while watching tv</li>
    <li> As someone with hair that grows back extremely fast, and dark, I&#x27;m always looking for new products to combat this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first area I tried this on was my armpits. Hot damn. I could barely hold it there a second. My heart was racing, eyes tearing up, clammy all over. So painful. And like many others have claimed, I can handle pain. But holy hair pulling, that was too much. Thinking I was too weak for an epilator, the months following I just used it as a razor and it was awesome! Long battery, comes with everything you need, portable. Very awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t until recently I saw it sitting there and had been a day without shaving so the hair was short but there. I tried it on my legs (under the knee, haven&#x27;t tried it yet but I think above the knee may be too sensitive) and it works. It was of course verrrry painful but pulling the skin taut and creating pain divergence by digging my nails in to where I was holding the skin helped. Also, I was watching a very interesting documentary so that kept my mind occupied, HUGE benefit. Of course it doesn&#x27;t get everything, it&#x27;s still patchy but it gets better. It grows back slower and in-between I try to go over again areas that were not removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up. Prepare for pain.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this hair remover. Painful at first. But it does the trick.</li>
    <li> Painless way of removing hair... great to have... could have given 5 star but it lacks speed.. time consuming procedure... otherwise a great product.. Worth the amount paid</li>
    <li> I received this today and it is going back. I can&#x27;t say it hurt, it wasn&#x27;t too bad. I just didn&#x27;t feel any difference before or after. I felt as much stubble after I used it. Maybe I wasn&#x27;t doing something right? I just wanted it for the chin and upper lip. I&#x27;ll keep tweezing, it costs a lot less.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my wife she loves this thing talks about how good it is all the time.</li>
    <li> Ask yourself these questions:&lt;br /&gt;1. Do you like waxes but A. think they&#x27;re too expensive and B. hate having to wait until you&#x27;re hairy as the Yeti before getting them?&lt;br /&gt;2. Do you hate having hair with a burning passion?&lt;br /&gt;3. Are you lazy and hate keeping up with constantly shaving?&lt;br /&gt;4. Do you have a relatively high tolerance for pain or have a supply of ibuprofen?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you answered yes to these questions this product is for you! My personal tips:&lt;br /&gt;-Take an ibuprofen about 20-30min before you start.&lt;br /&gt;-I prefer the shower method because the foaming is very entertaining.&lt;br /&gt;-Use it until you&#x27;ve had enough. Then shave the rest. The next time you shower repeat. You don&#x27;t have to completely remove everything in one fell swoop. Slow and steady wins the race.</li>
    <li> I like this epilator very much.  I had another one and it works great but lost the charge wire.  This one is less painful but doesn&#x27;t get all the hair at first.  I think that is why it is less painful (and it&#x27;s not too loud).  It also has different heads for shaving too.  It last longer on a charge.  I gave it a 4 star (a strong 4 star) because it is great but takes time to get all the hair.  I really like it and would recommend it!</li>
    <li> I had shaved my arms and legs two days before this item arrived.  I was thinking that I&#x27;ll have to wait few days before I can try it.  I just tried it on my arm anyway, and it started removing the hair that me and my boyfriend could not even see.  It made my arm smooth like silk.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I have shaved, waxed and used creams on my body hair. I like this the best. If you have been waxed before, this is a lot less painful. The difference being waxing still stings for hours after you do it. This only hurts while your doing it. I don&#x27;t think my legs get as smooth as when I shave but not having to do it every single day is completely worth it.</li>
    <li> I have not had this item for long, but so far so good. I can use it a few times before having to recharge and I love that it has both the epilator and a razor. Lightweight and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving my legs for decades. I don&#x27;t enjoy it - but who does? Stubble appears the next day and the process needs to be repeated over and over...  So earlier this summer, I decided to investigate epilators - for my legs only. I spent way too much time reading reviews, and concluded that whether one will like it or not depends largely on pain threshold. I have a pretty high tolerance to pain, so decided to give it go. Given the range of prices, I looked for a model that had generally great reviews, but was not over the top expensive. Oh - and I wanted a reasonable design, as well! Based on reviews, cost, and looks, this Panasonic Epiglide seemed ideal. As a first-time user, I have been very happy with it. It has a number of guard caps and a shaver attachment, but don&#x27;t use anything but the main epilating head. There are a number of excellent reviews about epilation already posted, so I will make only three observations from my experience. 1) It is recommended to shave and exfoliate a day (or two) before epilating; shaving seems redundant, but is actually the ONLY way to start with an even growth and eliminate persistent stubble. I did not do this the first few times - and had concluded that epilating simply could not give you smooth legs. THEN I shaved the day before - and voila, smooth legs. 2) The process is not particularly painful; rather, as other reviewers have noted, it feels more like a slight electric shock. I find it less painful than plucking my eyebrows, although admittedly, there are many more hairs to \\&quot;pluck\\&quot; on my legs, so the sting CAN bring a tear to you eye, even if it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;hurt\\&quot; per se. 3) Some reviewers have commented on a problem with ingrown hairs afterwards. I have been epilating for several months now, and have not had that problem at all. I use the epilator on dry skin (usually a day after shaving and/or exfoliating) and do not put anything (like lotion or an astringent) on my skin afterwards. There are always red bumps afterwards, but these fade in a hour or two. Overall, I have been very happy with epilation. I have not tried other epilators, so I cannot compare, but could not be more pleased with this one. It is comfortable to use and holds a charge for at least 40 min of continuous use; I recently took it on a 10 day trip and used it for several touch ups, but never had to recharge it. It is such a treat to go days without shaving! Well worth the slight \\&quot;pain\\&quot; of the process.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent a ton of money, and time, trying to find a product that works to rid my face of unwanted hair.  I&#x27;ve found it!  I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times and have not used it wet, but it works exactly as promised.  I felt NO discomfort of any kind.  At first I thought it must not be working.  But so far, so good.  I&#x27;m not one to write reviews, but felt I had to share this one.</li>
    <li> Too time consuming and pretty painful. Removal does last longer than shaving but it feels like a million tweezers pulling at one spot and you end up having to keep it on the same spot for too long.</li>
    <li> The item arrived quickly but......&lt;br /&gt;Its not worth the money. It only works when not on the charger. The battery life is not great. The power of the unit suffers because of the short battery life. I would pass on this one if your looking for a powerful unit. This is not my first epilator, my first one lasted for years. Make sure when you purchase one that it operates while on the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line keep looking..............</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed was how quiet this product was compared to its competition. It works great on legs,not sure how it works on other body parts.</li>
    <li> Perhaps I don&#x27;t know how to properly use shaver, but very difficult to shave underneath arm on side of mastectomy.</li>
    <li> love this. I have used one for years but this is better because you can use it in the shower and it is less painfully that way! I also love that it has a trimmer attachment.</li>
    <li> Works well, nice quality. You just have to go over the area you are using this on multiple times for the first few uses.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed with the best price.&lt;br /&gt;Good brand, excellent quality, easy to use, to charge and to clean.&lt;br /&gt;And you can use when bathing. PERFECT!</li>
    <li> Hurts like hell but gets the hair out except the small fine hair.</li>
    <li> This product is good with fine hair, but with coarse hair it is painful and does not do the job well either. I would give it 3 stars since it has been mentioned on the manual that the product would be good with all kinds of hair growth.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s less pain then the other brands I&#x27;ve use for many years and it so nice that you can wash it out under water.</li>
    <li> Very impressed...I love that it has multiple heads.  Comes with the epilator and a razor.. wow!  i used the epilator on my legs and it did a great job.  I had to use the razor for the underarms, what a nice set.  Linna</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this epilator! I have had mine for years now and it works the same way it did the first time!&lt;br /&gt;you quickly charge it and voila! cordless! Awesome</li>
    <li> A great epilator made useless by the stupid design flaw, it&#x27;s inability to be used while charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Say I am in a rush to head out for a date and I notice I forgot to charge it. Nothing I can do, the epilator takes 1 hour to charge and doesn&#x27;t late you use it while charging. PATHETIC. Guess I will have to cancel the date. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it would be like any other Epilator, but I think this one has a sadistic sense of humor. It didn&#x27;t gently remove the hair as advertised, it ripped it from my leg and too a couple of layers of skin with it!</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t the most thorough epilator and leaves a lot of hairs, but it isn&#x27;t that painless in comparison to some. And It&#x27;s easy to use wet. The best thing about it is the trimmer and the electric shaver head (that is one close shaver).</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like it. First ever epilady thingy, and ouch. Didn&#x27;t work for me and hurt at the same time! ..What?!?  I thought it would be a satiny heaven of glory bubbly bliss, super smooth sexy. Gleaned across a perfectly prepped surface, I felt &amp;#34;yeah!&amp;#34; stinging and lo, and behold, there is stubble. Lots. Repeat. Calm. Hm. Slower? Hm. But it Hurt! Shouldn&#x27;t the hair/ stubble/ whateveryouhate be gone?  I Am Thinking Junk. As it grabs ONE lil hair, with my new fandangled epilator, my common sense says &amp;#34;are you f&#x27;n stupid??&amp;#34;  I will stay with shaving, and waxing. The &amp;#34;pullers&amp;#34; on this did not work on my legs, the razor adapter did not either. Surprisingly, I thought I would get a clean shave like the men with their cordless, fancy razors. Oh No. Not a dent. I am not growing steel wool here! Sigh, back to the wax for me and a waste of $ if you try this. Keep your bucks, girls, and go in for a treat of a wax now and then. Otherwise, I am a fan of the Daisy Shave. Best ever and cheap and be sure to change it once every few days, this Panasonic thing cound not even find the stuble (and it was there #sasquatch) Best of luck my dears!</li>
    <li> I tried using an epilator way back in the eighties when they first came out. The concept was great, but the reality was that they just didn&#x27;t get out all the hairs, and the ones that were pulled out often grew back as ingrown hairs. But the idea was great, and I&#x27;ve been considering purchasing an epilator for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having recently tried and reviewed the [[ASIN:B00AN5LADI Veet Easy Wax Roll On Kit, 1 Count]], I knew I could handle the discomfort of continuous hair removal, but was hoping to find something that wouldn&#x27;t require quite the same time commitment. This is it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This epilator is incredibly easy to use. The instruction manual it comes with carries many warnings, some of which had me a little concerned, but they basically came down to a bunch of CYAs. Every possible risk is mentioned, but I didn&#x27;t have any problems using the product itself. Hairs are removed quickly and efficiently and with minimal pain. Yes, it does sting a bit at first, but I quickly adapted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this epilator is as easy as using a razor. It comes with a shaving head as well as a guard to use on the epilator head for newbies to the process. Having just come off regularly waxing, I opted to forgo the guard and didn&#x27;t have any problems at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit charges quickly and claims to hold 40 minutes of power. I needed only about 20-30 minutes to get both legs done, so I didn&#x27;t test to see if the power held for a full 40 minutes, but I can say that the power was continuous and consistent for the entire time I was using the epilator. Clean up is also quite convenient with the little brush that comes included. For storage, the unit comes with a little satin bag that carries the epilator, the attachments, and even the power cord. Interestingly, an insert in the box directs users NOT to store the extra head and guard in the bag, but I think if you&#x27;re not traveling with it, it&#x27;s just fine. I would have preferred a more rigid case so things don&#x27;t rattle around in the bag (heck, the box might have been a good container if it had not been designed to showcase the product and therefore have an open area that would require perfect repackaging every time you use it). But the storage bag is just avery minor complaint about a very good product. This was definitely a purchase that I am glad I made!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA: I&#x27;ve been using this on my face--both my upper lip and chin, and it does an amazing job. While it misses a coarse hair here and there, it gets the finer hairs that are time-consuming to tweeze. While it made me cringe for the first few passes, it isn&#x27;t any worse than waxing, but it is soooo much easier. And without the wax, I don&#x27;t have to worry about breakouts that have resulted from the oil that&#x27;s used to remove wax.</li>
    <li> This epilator offers the worst of all worlds -- it&#x27;s painful, and it doesn&#x27;t remove most of the hair.  In case it helps with context, I bought this chiefly to use on my legs.  I have very fine hair, but a lot of it.  Bottom line, the tool removed SOME hair, but I had to go back over my legs with a razor.  Since the entire point was to stop using the razor, the epilator was essentially useless for my purposes.</li>
</ol>
