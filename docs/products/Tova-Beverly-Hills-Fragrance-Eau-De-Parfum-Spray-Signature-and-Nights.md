      <li>Love the product &amp;#34;Tova Signature by Toba For Women.</li>
      <li>love this cologne and always receive compliments.....</li>
      <li>Price gouging at its most greedy.</li>
      <li>Love tova and the price.</li>
      <li>Girlfriend&#x27;s favorite.</li>
      <li>Also I will make sure not to ever make another purchase from the company Beauty Encounter.</li>
      <li>Many people started to wear this perfume because of me.</li>
      <li>I love it and it was delivered on time</li>
      <li>have worn Tova for many years and I get so many compliments</li>
      <li>Then Tova beauty products went to QVC where I continued purchasing this absolutely lovely fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Love, love, love this perfume.  </li>
      <li>I have beeen wearing TOVA for years when it was on QVC--then for some reason QVC was not selling, which made me very upset, so now - I am so happy I was able to purchase TOVA on amazon.</li>
      <li>Love my Tova perfume.</li>
      <li>I love it, i used it in the nintys.</li>
      <li>others love the smell and compliment all the time.</li>
      <li>I almost called to make sure it wasn&#x27;t a mistake.  </li>
      <li>I get so many compliments when wearing it.  </li>
      <li>Love this perfume.  </li>
      <li>and she says &amp;#34;I love it.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I googled this product and found it on Amazon another favorite website of mine.  </li>
      <li>So what has happened to Tova&#x27;s original formula and why in the world, in spite of rave reviews, top sales and great success would she ever think to change her formula?</li>
      <li>What everyone notices is the nice clean refreshing scent.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a very clean scent</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a light smell that catches your senses &amp; leaves you searching for more.</li>
      <li>I wear a perfume scent very rarely now, too many people have allergies.</li>
      <li>I have never received more compliments on a perfume than on that original scent.</li>
      <li>but this one works fine.</li>
      <li>Used in perfumes for centuries, these beautiful and magical scents can linger for days and were widely sought after by perfume companies.  </li>
      <li>Well ok  I can see that , but when it was listed as new I would think it would look good as new!!!</li>
      <li>I use to be a huge fan of this product</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like and keep this  as I am in search of a nice perfume.</li>
      <li>So light</li>
      <li>It is no longer available at QVC.  </li>
      <li>for my mother&#x27;s birthday she will enjoy</li>
      <li>it smells exactly like the pheromone scents that another company sells-horrible!!</li>
      <li>Tova Signature is a beautiful mix of vanilla, musk, a little citrus and more.</li>
      <li>If you have migraines &amp; are looking for a light fresh scent stay away from this!</li>
      <li>Light, clean, scent.</li>
      <li>, I get many of them from men who say it is not overly powerful or sweet or too flowery.</li>
      <li>Love this perfume arrived very fast</li>
      <li>Use to purchase the original Tova.</li>
      <li>It is clean and smells divine.  </li>
      <li>Nice fragrance , but doesn&#x27;t last for more than a couple of hours.</li>
      <li>it will NOT be Tova&#x27;s  true, original formula no matter what they claim or how they package it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not awful, but it&#x27;s NOT the real Tova Signature by Tova that is sold by QVC.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad fragrance</li>
      <li>and I want her to smell good for a long time.</li>
      <li>Going on the look of the bottle and the seller thinking that it was ok to list as new....</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t believe this is the original formula that I got when I first started wearing this about 15 years ago; think it is reformulated and will not purchase from anyone again.</li>
      <li>The same name perfume I bought from you  last time had a stronger and more pleasant scent.  </li>
      <li>I was surprised how many men complimented me on Tova&#x27;s Signature Parfum.</li>
      <li>Why tamper with success?</li>
      <li>I hope it was not only for the holiday season and that the fragrance remains available at this more affordable price.  </li>
      <li>Such a nice scent.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this perfume.  People stop me and ask what am I wearing.</li>
    <li> I have been using Tova for years.  Always purchased it from QVC because I had to.  It literally was the only place it could be purchased.  Tried to buy some today they did not have my Tova Signature bottle in stock.  I ended up calling QVC because I couldn&#x27;t find it online.  I was willing to waitlist this item because I had to do that the last time I ordered it.  Now here I am again loving this product and not being able to buy it.  I googled this product and found it on Amazon another favorite website of mine.  I fell off my chair when I saw the price!!!!!!  Price is ridiculous!!!!!!!  I almost called to make sure it wasn&#x27;t a mistake.  All I can say is I&#x27;m shocked and I guess I will be looking for a new perfume.</li>
    <li> Great! Least all day!</li>
    <li> I have used this perfume for years and years and years and have had lots and lots of compliments on it.  It is no longer available at QVC.  I was told that a certain ingredient that is in it, has now become almost impossible to get.  I was told that they continue to try to get the ingredient.  I am sure that is why the product is suddently so expensive and only a few bottles are probably being made for those who can afford to pay the high price.  I can&#x27;t, but I am so dissappointed because I am still looking for that perfect perfume to fill its place.  Nothing I have found so far even compares to it.</li>
    <li> The same name perfume I bought from you  last time had a stronger and more pleasant scent.  I was very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Love my TOVA Signature!!!</li>
    <li> this perfume stinks like bug spray-it smells like a lot of the perfumes do now since they cant get the original ingredients anymore due to cost-it smells exactly like the pheromone scents that another company sells-horrible!! Save your money-don&#x27;t buy!!</li>
    <li> This smells like Off bug spray. Big waste of money. Very disappointed. Do not order this unless you like to smell like Off.</li>
    <li> I wear a perfume scent very rarely now, too many people have allergies. But, when I do wear a scent it is always Tova&#x27;s Signature Parfum spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have worn Tova for many years and I get so many compliments, I get many of them from men who say it is not overly powerful or sweet or too flowery. What everyone notices is the nice clean refreshing scent. People on the street would stop and ask me the name of it so that they could purchase it. I was surprised how many men complimented me on Tova&#x27;s Signature Parfum. I also never realized also how long the fragrance lasts as I will put it on in the morning and by late afternoon, the scent still lingers. I highly recommend this. What sold me on Tova&#x27;s parfum were other women who wore the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Signature eau de parfum fragrance in the Beauty by Tova Collection. The perfume formula utilizes precious natural essential oils, including a top note of bergamot, middle notes of lavender and jasmine, and base notes of amber, sandalwood, and musk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended. prisrob 10-17-13</li>
    <li> Gentlemen, go out of your way to obtain this fragrance for your favorite lady, as she will love it and you.</li>
    <li> Been using it for years. It is still my favorite.</li>
    <li> Ordering was effordless...</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments from men with this sensual mysterious scent. Ooh la la.</li>
    <li> my signature perfume thank you&lt;br /&gt;Tova</li>
    <li> This is one of the hardest perfumes to find. There are a few others close in name but this is the one my wife loves. She has been wearing it forever and loves it.</li>
    <li> Excellent perfume.  So light and my husband loves it!</li>
    <li> every time I wear it  I have non stop comments  every body loves it and is always asking about it I have never had this much attention.</li>
    <li> I love it and it was delivered on time</li>
    <li> I have used TOVA Signature for about 25 years.  I use no other fragrance. It is clean and smells divine.  I get &amp;#34;what are you wearing&amp;#34; every time I go out. I just hate that the original is no longer available.  I am at the point of paying a high price to a collector with an original bottle.  I figure at my age if I use it sparingly it might last until I die!  Then spray me and send me to heaven wearing TOVA!</li>
    <li> The best perfume ever.  I get compliments every time I wear it.  This perfume is light and sexy, never  overwhelming. Love, Love Love!</li>
    <li> because SHE smells great wearing it and when she smells great she feels great and looks amazingly beautiful with it.</li>
    <li> It would be perfect if were truly the original formula but this one works fine. It is the best underarm deordorant.  If you shave or have sensitive underarms, don&#x27;t spray it there.</li>
    <li> You will feel utterly glamorous in this lovely scent. A very refreshing fragrance, indeed.  Highly recommended.  DAME HILDA VAN WINKLE</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance , but doesn&#x27;t last for more than a couple of hours.</li>
    <li> Many people started to wear this perfume because of me.My sisters,my friends.&lt;br /&gt;I like its scent and feel that it suits my skin perfectly.</li>
    <li> Such a nice scent. As long as Tova makes this, I&#x27;ll buy it. I always get compliments when I wear it.</li>
    <li> Danced with a woman that was wearing this perfume...asked her about it later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the MOST unforgettable scent...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still can&#x27;t get it out of my head.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume arrived very fast</li>
    <li> I am disappointed with Tova this time, it does not seem to last as it used to.</li>
    <li> I love it, i used it in the nintys. I am a nurse, and i get compliments on it yhe whole 12 hours.its ot overwelming,because some of my patients are nauseated,andI dont want to make them feel worse.</li>
    <li> When I first received, I was so excited that I had finally found Tova, but was immediately disappointed in the quality.  It is definitely not the original scent!!  It is like spraying on water and it definitely has no lasting scent.  I use to be a huge fan of this product and it is really a disappointment.</li>
    <li> Not exactly like the old original Tova, but close. I like the fragrance. I would purchase it again for myself, or for a gift.</li>
    <li> If this perfume was just for me, I wouldn&#x27;t care that the box arrived worn &amp; used looking.  But this is a gift and it looks like I&#x27;m re-gifting.  I know the \\&quot;ad\\&quot; says \\&quot;Packaging for this product may vary from that shown in the image\\&quot; but they should have mentioned if you buy this product it will come in a box that is worn and not cello wrapped.  They did ship right away, so at least I have this gift in time.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume.  I get so many compliments when wearing it.  I am a nurse and have to be careful in picking scents to wear to work.  This perfume is not offensive at all.</li>
    <li> Wonderful perfume, I&#x27;ve been using this for years and LOVE IT !!!</li>
    <li> Use to purchase the original Tova. This new Tova barely has the scent of the original and doesn&#x27;t have any staying power.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my daughter and she was thrilled to get it.</li>
    <li> This is the most beautiful perfume I have ever used.  I can recommend it highly. I CANNOT recommend the price it is being sold at here.Price gouging at its most greedy.This size usually sells for abt $80.</li>
    <li> Light, clean, scent. No vanilla smell. I wear it in both cold and hot weather. Never uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Picks me up when I&#x27;m feeling drowsy.</li>
    <li> This is not the same Tova, that I wore for years.  The scent just doesn&#x27;t last</li>
    <li> It definitely doesn&#x27;t smell like the old Tova. Everytime I buy it again I am hoping it is the old scent but it isn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe this is the original formula that I got when I first started wearing this about 15 years ago; think it is reformulated and will not purchase from anyone again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful perfume. Exotic lasting fragrance. Mild and soft not harsh or pungent. Enjoyed it immensely.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells terrible...exactly like bug spray.  Very nauseating.  Can&#x27;t return due to hazardous material.  If you have migraines &amp; are looking for a light fresh scent stay away from this! Try philosophy amazing grace or pure grace they smell wonderful fresh &amp; light!</li>
    <li> Have been wearing this cologne for years....love it!</li>
    <li> how did this happen.  the first two days it had a beautiful odor.  the third day it really had a bad smell.  i returned it immediately.</li>
    <li> It was packed very secure.......I never have a problem with any of the vendors doing business thru Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;I love this cologne and always receive compliments.....The scent is lovely......not over powering.</li>
    <li> Tova for Women Signature fragrance has been my signature fragrance for many years; as far back as when Tova of Beverly Hills was in business with dedicated customer service representatives.  Then Tova beauty products went to QVC where I continued purchasing this absolutely lovely fragrance.  I have a sensitive nose for fragrances ... many modern fragrances have the same undertones and are not distinctive.  Tova Signature fragrance for Women is definitely distinctive.  If you are allergic, Tova Signature fragrance is for you!  It is subtle but there in the most feminine and winning way.  Guaranteed that you will get complements ... &amp;#34;what is that fragrance you&#x27;re wearing?&amp;#34; ...  as I have over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one set-back is the price.  Since it became unavailable on QVC,  there are vendors at Amazon.com that do sell it, but they usually sell it at extremely high prices.  I was very happy to see this vendor offering Tova Signature for Women at the most reasonable price to date.  I hope it was not only for the holiday season and that the fragrance remains available at this more affordable price.  Just love Tova Signature fragrance for Women! And you will, too.</li>
    <li> Great!! Wife loves it.</li>
    <li> Great parfum. My wife has been looking for this parfum for a long time. The only place that she knew where the product was sold was on QVC. She is very satisfied and loves the parfum.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this perfume.  Have been using it for years.  The only perfume I use.  I hope they don&#x27;t stop making it.</li>
    <li> Love tova and the price.</li>
    <li> I decided to try these Tova fragrances as even the last classic bottle I bought (Before these ridiculous price increases!) wasn&#x27;t the same either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad fragrance it&#x27;s just not THE Tova fragrance.  How in the heck can they not be making that anymore?  I have never received more compliments on a perfume than on that original scent.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive this perfume only to find out it smells of alcohol and very little of an actual perfume. When I sprayed it on my wrists it smelled nice for about half an hour and than it was gone. I won&#x27;t even mention spraying it on my scarf and after just awhile not smelling it exist at all. It is horrible that company would not take it back from such unhappy customer. Like: you opened it and now you can not return it. It&#x27;s a lot money to waste and would not recommend it to anyone. Also I will make sure not to ever make another purchase from the company Beauty Encounter.</li>
    <li> Material received was brand new in box. Wife loved it.</li>
    <li> for my mother&#x27;s birthday she will enjoy</li>
    <li> Ever wonder why some of the world&#x27;s most beautiful essences and perfumes, from the past decades, have just seemingly disappeared into oblivion, been discontinued or have had their &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; scents changed, altered or made in a weaker strength and not very long lasting. I did too, so I did a bit of research to try and discover the reason for such a drastic change in the perfume industry. Some of the most popular and beautiful scents and perfumes from the 70&#x27;s, 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s are no longer made or can&#x27;t be found anywhere. Tova EDP was one of my most beloved scents. So what has happened to Tova&#x27;s original formula and why in the world, in spite of rave reviews, top sales and great success would she ever think to change her formula? Why tamper with success? In earlier decades it was legal to obtain gland oil (made into perfume) from certain animals...Ambergris (sperm whales)...Civit (civit cat)...Musk (deer and other animals) ect. Used in perfumes for centuries, these beautiful and magical scents can linger for days and were widely sought after by perfume companies.  Not long after Tova introduced her fragrance, laws and regulations were passed to restrict or prohibit the use of these products in perfumes to protect these endangered species. It seems she had no choice but to comply and find artificial substitutes for some ingredients in her formula. Unfortunately, some artificial substitutes are not long-lasting, are chemically unstable in perfumes and can alter it&#x27;s scent at any time, giving off a kind of funky essence thus changing the formula completely. I expect Tova was devastated, amid the huge amount of negative reviews since the formula change, which is most likely why she sold her company to QVC. There are many places offering Tova&#x27;s original formula perfume for outrageous, ridiculous prices... BUYER BEWARE... it will NOT be Tova&#x27;s  true, original formula no matter what they claim or how they package it. I gave this product three stars because even though it can never come close to Tova&#x27;s beautiful, magical, original formula... it still has some charm, though not as pure and long-lasting as it once was, we finally understand why that is and why it will never be the same again...nevermore.</li>
    <li> Tova Signature is a beautiful mix of vanilla, musk, a little citrus and more. It is soft, subtle but oh so sexy! First time trying it and love the soft smell and lingering effect. Even thought I can&#x27;t smell on myself others love the smell and compliment all the time.</li>
    <li> Love my Tova perfume.</li>
    <li> Very nice fragrance. Girlfriend&#x27;s favorite. I got the larger size.She ran out of her smaller bottle and I want her to smell good for a long time.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Tova Signature has been my cologne for over 25 years.</li>
    <li> Formula has changed . Not what it used to be , that&#x27;s why only 4 stars. Did save around 20.00 buying here.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift and the recipient is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I was very unhappy with the condition of my tova bottle.... The bottle had a large crack/break in it, with the cap and label all scratched up.... I did contact the seller who said I should have read the dicripton  she left... Well ok  I can see that , but when it was listed as new I would think it would look good as new!!! The seller did say that it would smell the same..... But I could send it back to her and she would give me my money back..... Going on the look of the bottle and the seller thinking that it was ok to list as new....lol  I will just keep it and end all ties with this seller.....</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this item to any Tova Signature lovers.  It&#x27;s not the same fragrance as sold by QVC.  This version seems to be mixed with something else.  It&#x27;s not awful, but it&#x27;s NOT the real Tova Signature by Tova that is sold by QVC.  Also, the perfume box appeared old and was damaged.</li>
    <li> The fragrance only last s a half hour or so, not pleased at all</li>
    <li> Beautiful light soft smell that is perfect for someone who cannot handle strong smelling perfumes. It&#x27;s a light smell that catches your senses &amp; leaves you searching for more. My signature smell was discontinued a few years ago and I&#x27;m happy to say I&#x27;ve found a replacement...Tova Signature.</li>
    <li> Love the product &amp;#34;Tova Signature by Toba For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 3.3 Oz. The scent is unforgetable, although after purchase, I found that it can also be purchased through &amp;#34;QVC&amp;#34; for $30.00 less and it includes Body Lotion and Body Gel...</li>
    <li> Very nice smelling perfume. Really like it. Smell stays with you &amp; is not over powering.</li>
    <li> My wife, Ingrid, ordered this and she says &amp;#34;I love it.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have beeen wearing TOVA for years when it was on QVC--then for some reason QVC was not selling, which made me very upset, so now - I am so happy I was able to purchase TOVA on amazon. THANK YOU!  it&#x27;s a very clean scent and I always get lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> favorite perfume in the world! Such classy smell, not to much and get so many compliments</li>
    <li> I bought Tova Signature and her other one, something Nights.  Can&#x27;t recall the name.  I read these reviews of how wonderful her scents were years ago and I wish I was able to have experienced them.  What I have is gross!  I have even done experiments with friends.  I will put Tova on one wrist and another of my perfumes on my opposite wrist and let friends pick which they like better.  I;m sorry to say Tova doesn&#x27;t rank.  Actually her Signature scent has been compared to \\&quot;bug spray\\&quot;.  Before telling anybody that I thought it smelled a bit like Citronella bug repellant, I let them smell it.  It&#x27;s unanimous!!  But will it keep the mosquitos at bay?  Maybe, maybe not but for the price I will purchase the bug repellant.  I really wanted to like and keep this  as I am in search of a nice perfume.</li>
    <li> Love the scent !  Will order again . fast,</li>
