      <li>Use smooth, easy strokes.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Worth much more than the price.</li>

      <li>/&gt;  - depending on your beard, CLEAN your razor every other shave, at least.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;  - takes me about 5, 7 minutes to shave as opposed to 2, 3 minutes with my old Remington.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Foil + blades on my old Remington lasted maybe 4 months.  </li>

    <li> Got this shaver back in May, 2014.&lt;br /&gt; -The Good --&lt;br /&gt;  - shaves well - I have a &#x27;medium&#x27; beard. You just have to go over the same spot 2, 3 times -- DON&amp;#34;T  &#x27;push down&#x27;  hard to shave. Use smooth, easy strokes.&lt;br /&gt;  - the foil holds up very well.  Each one of my 6 Remington Foil Razors were  $39.99 each !&lt;br /&gt;  - great to get the extra blades AND an extra foil.  Foil + blades on my old Remington lasted maybe 4 months.  Replacement was $26.95 for the 2 - when I could find a store that had them.&lt;br /&gt;  - depending on your beard, CLEAN your razor every other shave, at least.&lt;br /&gt; -The BAD --&lt;br /&gt;  - takes me about 5, 7 minutes to shave as opposed to 2, 3 minutes with my old Remington.&lt;br /&gt;  - shaving area is about 75% wide of traditional foil razors( Braun; Remington, Panasonic ).&lt;br /&gt;  - figure  10  -to-  12  hours for a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, 1 -to- 10 ? .... I give it an 8.  I paid $8.95.  GREAT price for an electric.  Buy One.</li>
    <li> This is an outstanding shaver for the price! Worth much more than the price. Great Quality.</li>
    <li> The box was a little small for everything inside</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a family member who is very pleased. This gives a close shave without cutting. We caught this on sale making purchase a very good deal!</li>
    <li> Did not work.  Very cheaply made.</li>
    <li> Not the best at getting a fully clean shave but good for trips or keeping a razor shave good for a few extra days.  For the price it does what it needs to.</li>
    <li> HDE Rechargeable Electric Shaver - popup trimmer broke on first use.  The shave is a bit rough.  Toy quality.  Boy&#x27;s first shaver.</li>
    <li> the HDE sleek works work, I have used 3 times already , it works fine , the charge is good still hold the charge.</li>
    <li> Sleek portable shaver. Please note the instructions state that it needs to be charged with 220v AC. This is normal in Europe, not the US. I do not know if it will charge off 110v and it takes longer or won&#x27;t last has long per charge. I picked up a cheap up converter just in case. With the low price of this device, another $7 for an up converter still had the total less than other travel shavers.</li>
    <li> The shave is okay but takes forever to recharge.</li>
    <li> the shaver is fair I mean it cuts but you wont get a real close shave you might was to spend a few extra dollars and get a name brand. But it is not bad</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work right out of the box. Might as well take that $8 and set it on fire.</li>
    <li> It is ok the quality is not the greatest and the case came broken. It would be to much hassle trying to return it.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> nothing is everthing bad, i am sorry</li>
    <li> Would have been nice to know it was 220 and can&#x27;t be charged is the US.</li>
