### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>However, what I can say is that this product has worked the best out of anything that I have tried.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Is very good.</li>
      <li>This is a very good product.</li>
      <li>this worked great.  </li>
      <li>For the price great product</li>
      <li>the price was great too</li>
      <li>have been using this for about 3-4 times a week, for two weeks now, and I am really happy with the results.</li>
      <li>It wasnt as good as I thought it would be.</li>
      <li>Has a very nice smell which is very light.</li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>This is an amazing skin cleanser.</li>
      <li>It was still nice</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
      <li>but this is the most effective scrub I&#x27;ve used yet.</li>
      <li>It feels really good and minty on your face and it feels like it leaves your skin clean because of the mint tingle it gives after washing your face.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had this for about 6-7 months and not just because there is a lot of uses in it, but because it made my skin so oil free that I didn&#x27;t need it any more!</li>
      <li>Exfoliation can often produce more oil.</li>
      <li>and I was totally satisfied.</li>
      <li>and I love them.  </li>
      <li>Will continue search for better.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Happy Face :)</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is the BEST facial scrub I have EVER used.</li>
      <li>Maybe it was just placebo effect, but I felt like my skin did have more of a &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; finish throughout the day, but even if that was just in my mind, it did help control</li>
      <li>I think the ladies would like it too :)</li>
      <li>More runny/liquidy than gel but works fine.</li>
      <li>It does have a lovely light scent.</li>
      <li>Works fine.</li>
      <li>For a while this product was really helping diminish my acne and scars and I liked the way the scrub felt when washing</li>
      <li>Overall a great product.</li>
      <li>- it definitely isn&#x27;t floral or girly - but more light menthol/clean scent which I really liked.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is nice and smooth, has no fragrance, and leaves my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>This just seems like a clean complementing smell as opposed to guy smell</li>
      <li>What you want your product to do is CLEAN your pores, so pores APPEAR smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and you feel clean</li>
      <li>Nothing special</li>
      <li>so good that I only use my sample packet when I have a special occasion to go to...</li>
      <li>If you have oily skin: try it on your full face.</li>
      <li>The best it really cleans your pores and makes them less noticeable</li>
      <li>Previously I had used Nivea for Men face wash and although it smells good, sometimes I felt like I had too many competing smells</li>
      <li>It leaves my face feeling fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>After 2 uses of this, my mom asked me if I was pregnant because my face was glowing, and I didn&#x27;t have on makeup.</li>
      <li>A sudsy effective deep clean.</li>
      <li>They work great as cleansers but again do little for oil control</li>
      <li>I used this product for about a month before any real results, but this is so worth it!</li>
      <li>The exfoliating beads are so fine, that they don&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin at all.</li>
      <li>my nose is blackhead free, my skin is really soft, and it doesn&#x27;t smell like flours or perfume.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Usually, my face gets pretty oily after washing with a product within the first 30 minutes or so.</li>
      <li>All skins types are different so maybe works better for someone else.</li>
      <li>Original review: So far I have been using this product for about a week</li>
      <li>I really like the smell and really, it is reasonable price too!  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t feel it did much difference for my skin</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t feel to much difference after I washed my face.</li>
      <li>I have very oily,</li>
      <li>Either way - I like this wash and would highly recommend it for guys too!</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really lather much on so</li>
      <li>I really like the smell</li>
      <li>my package came really fast like</li>
      <li>I really really like this stuff.  </li>
      <li>That is a life saver and a definite need for a clean face.)  </li>
      <li>Last but not least, it smells like something I&#x27;d clean my bathroom with.</li>
      <li>The acne and acne scars are hugely diminished, the blackheads are becoming less noticeable, and my pores are smaller.</li>
      <li>Although I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m completely oil free for the entire day.</li>
      <li>Perhaps it was from the salicylic acid since I haven&#x27;t used a product with that in it for years (probably since I was in high school), but it was kind of a surprise since I&#x27;ve just dealt with a few blemishes by waiting it out (overall I don&#x27;t have much for blemish prone skin</li>
      <li>It leaves my face feeling so clean, helps swipe away any dry patches, and has helped keep my breakouts to a minimum.</li>
      <li>After using this for a few short days, my skin feels tighter, my pores are smaller and cleaner, and honestly my complexion is overall much better.</li>
      <li>I had the normal breakouts from changing my skin care regimen.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive/combo skin, and as soon as I noticed that this new scrub from Garnier has both charcoal, and salicylic acid in it, I grabbed one to try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>my face feels very sensitive to the touch</li>
      <li>I dare not waste it!</li>
      <li>I doubt it will clear out everything</li>
      <li>and my skin was relatively clear.</li>
      <li>So I got this at Wal-mart but was really pleasantly surprised by how well this cleanser worked for me.</li>
      <li>Also, though it doesn&#x27;t say so clearly on the packaging, it does contain salicylic acid, which may be far too drying for some users.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s runny, doesn&#x27;t lather well, and has a decidedly masculine aroma (almost like aftershave).</li>
      <li>I will update if I find any more change within the next few weeks.</li>
      <li>Definitely try to stick it out for a few more weeks if you don&#x27;t think it is working, because I changed my mind</li>
      <li>With this face wash, I can go a couple of hours completely oil free and by the end of the day, still only have half the amount of oil on my skin than I used to.</li>
      <li>I first wet my face and hands, then squeeze out a dime size amount.</li>
      <li>I purchased this item as a less expensive replacement for my Boscia charcoal cleanser (a huge LOVE, but too pricey).</li>
      <li>so I went back to my old skin care product.</li>
      <li>I was right for once it didn&#x27;t get worse my skin actually improved after the first use!</li>
      <li>Purchased this because I was looking to try a new facial wash that I could use as a daily facial cleanser.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also tried many diy masks and scrubs, even oil pulling, and some only made it worse.</li>
      <li>I definitely seemed to have clearer skin (or less acne - although I don&#x27;t have much but around my nose)  after using this face wash.  </li>
      <li>I have very oily skin and see little reduction in oil control using this product.</li>

<li> This cleanser foams a lot, if you have a wet face and hands, so only a tiny bit is necessary.</li>
<li> Later in the day after use, I started noticing flaky, dry patches on my face which I&#x27;ve never had before.</li>
<li> so that&#x27;s probably why it&#x27;s extra dry.</li>
<li> right after washing the past few days</li>
<li> It does dry out the skin a bit</li>
<li> I still rate 4 stars for the initial use and few weeks after but only 3 after continuous use.</li>
<li> It takes only a day and half for my pimples to disappear after I use it</li>
<li> I could never really treat my blackhead problem until now.</li>
<li> Problem is that my skin is oily again only after a few hours after applied and my skin is shiny again.</li>
<li> I am careful to avoid the eye area, and rinse well.</li>
<li> Your chin and any other place</li>
<li> Nothing that hoped for, just an average cleansing solution.</li>
<li> The consistency of this is a not too thick gel, with tiny micro-bead scrubbers in it.</li>
<li> and it has a slight burning sensation after it&#x27;s been washed with this stuff.</li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works fine. Nothing special</li>
    <li> The only reason I wanted to try this is because of the charcoal.  I keep activated charcoal pills in my house to use when I get sick and I love them.  And I was intrigued by using a facial cleanse with charcoal in it.  I really really like this stuff.  I do not like those little exfoliating beads in scrubs because it makes me feel like I&#x27;m using a brillo pad or something. This stuff is nice and smooth, has no fragrance, and leaves my skin soft and smooth.  After 2 uses of this, my mom asked me if I was pregnant because my face was glowing, and I didn&#x27;t have on makeup.</li>
    <li> I used this product for about a month before any real results, but this is so worth it! I&#x27;ve had this for about 6-7 months and not just because there is a lot of uses in it, but because it made my skin so oil free that I didn&#x27;t need it any more! Definitely try to stick it out for a few more weeks if you don&#x27;t think it is working, because I changed my mind and I think a lot of others will, too.</li>
    <li> I buy stuff based on reviews and I was totally satisfied. This is a very good product. and you feel clean n refreshed!</li>
    <li> Nothing that hoped for, just an average cleansing solution. Will continue search for better.</li>
    <li> News Flash: pores do not shrink. No product will make them smaller. What you want your product to do is CLEAN your pores, so pores APPEAR smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know that place on and either side of your nose? Your chin and any other place you see pores? For me, this product totally took care of all of those places!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I seldom get breakouts at my age, but I do find my cleanser doesn&#x27;t get all of the make-up or that my work desk phone irritates my chin, so I&#x27;ve been on the look out for a cleansing product. Salicylic acid is an exfoliate that  is too aggressive for my skin. Exfoliation can often produce more oil. If that oil isn&#x27;t swept away, it can clog your pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, this product doesn&#x27;t contain salicylic acid and it isn&#x27;t an aggressive exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it out. If you have oily skin: try it on your full face. If you have T-zone or spots, just scrub there and use your go-to product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Face :)</li>
    <li> I had the normal breakouts from changing my skin care regimen.  This gel is very thin and has no granules as expected.</li>
    <li> I have acne prone skin combined with a blackhead problem. It is always hard to balance the two issues when I have flare-ups. I would typically treat my skin with benzoyl peroxide or by trying a variety of salicylic acid treatments. I could never really treat my blackhead problem until now. After using this for a few short days, my skin feels tighter, my pores are smaller and cleaner, and honestly my complexion is overall much better. In order to treat my acne flare-ups, I use prescription benzoyl as a spot treatment . Looks like I finally found my balance. Overall a great product.</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin and see little reduction in oil control using this product. I use this product in concert with the blackhead reducing scrub. They work great as cleansers but again do little for oil control</li>
    <li> A sudsy effective deep clean.</li>
    <li> In stores it&#x27;s only 7 bucks, max. Also, isn&#x27;t a gel supposed to have a thick consistency? Because this doesn&#x27;t. Therefore, it&#x27;s not a gel. If Garnier was going to make it so runny they could have at least put it in a pump bottle and not one with a flip cap. Very messy. Last but not least, it smells like something I&#x27;d clean my bathroom with. If you&#x27;re in the market for an inexpensive charcoal cleanser, try Biore&#x27;s version.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive/combo skin, and as soon as I noticed that this new scrub from Garnier has both charcoal, and salicylic acid in it, I grabbed one to try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for about 3-4 times a week, for two weeks now, and I am really happy with the results. It leaves my face feeling so clean, helps swipe away any dry patches, and has helped keep my breakouts to a minimum. The exfoliating beads are so fine, that they don&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin at all. The consistency of this is a not too thick gel, with tiny micro-bead scrubbers in it. It has a fresh/unisex smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use this: I first wet my face and hands, then squeeze out a dime size amount. This cleanser foams a lot, if you have a wet face and hands, so only a tiny bit is necessary. I am careful to avoid the eye area, and rinse well.</li>
    <li> It wasnt as good as I thought it would be. My pours are still big and my skin never cleared up.</li>
    <li> The product is not that thick and it vey runny so little messy when applying it over the sink. Has a very nice smell which is very light. Doesn&#x27;t really lather much on so didn&#x27;t feel to much difference after I washed my face. I didn&#x27;t feel it did much difference for my skin so I went back to my old skin care product. All skins types are different so maybe works better for someone else.</li>
    <li> It feels really good and minty on your face and it feels like it leaves your skin clean because of the mint tingle it gives after washing your face. Problem is that my skin is oily again only after a few hours after applied and my skin is shiny again. Also thought it might help with pores and I didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
    <li> More runny/liquidy than gel but works fine.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: For a while this product was really helping diminish my acne and scars and I liked the way the scrub felt when washing but it didn&#x27;t last for me. I still rate 4 stars for the initial use and few weeks after but only 3 after continuous use. It was still nice but there was no change in my skin anymore. I guess the acne fight continues. I&#x27;m trying out the Biore charcoal cleanser now. (I still use witch hazel daily though. That is a life saver and a definite need for a clean face.)  ----------  Original review: So far I have been using this product for about a week and I&#x27;m loving it. I have very oily, acne prone skin and blackheads are everywhere. I&#x27;m one of those people that has tried just about every brand of product and even prescribed medication for acne and none of it works. I&#x27;ve also tried many diy masks and scrubs, even oil pulling, and some only made it worse. Now I have patches of clogged pores not only on my face but my shoulders, chest, and back as well. I bought this on a whim thinking it couldn&#x27;t get any worse when I saw it had the salysilic acid and charcoal. I was right for once it didn&#x27;t get worse my skin actually improved after the first use! I&#x27;m not saying I&#x27;ve found my miracle product but it definitely helped. The acne and acne scars are hugely diminished, the blackheads are becoming less noticeable, and my pores are smaller. I doubt it will clear out everything but this is the most effective scrub I&#x27;ve used yet. It does dry out the skin a bit but I&#x27;ve also been using witch hazel and/or aloe vera right after washing the past few days so that&#x27;s probably why it&#x27;s extra dry. I will update if I find any more change within the next few weeks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different face washes and scrubs. Some give me breakouts, blackheads, or leave me oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one has done none of that! I tried it on a whim and I love it! my nose is blackhead free, my skin is really soft, and it doesn&#x27;t smell like flours or perfume.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing skin cleanser. I use it every day when I don&#x27;t use their Blackhead Charcoal Scrub. It leaves my face feeling fresh and clean. My sister also used this product and she said she saw a noticeable difference after just one use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have not noticed any difference in my skin since using this product. I have been using it now for about one year.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleansing gel twice a day for 2-3 weeks. It has not clarified, controlled shine, or mattified my skin. It does have a lovely light scent.</li>
    <li> Seems to be delivering on its promises.  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product and have only been using drops smaller than the size of a pea to scrub my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the BEST facial scrub I have EVER used. It takes only a day and half for my pimples to disappear after I use it but when I do it works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its so good that I only use my sample packet when I have a special occasion to go to...I dare not waste it!</li>
    <li> Purchased this because I was looking to try a new facial wash that I could use as a daily facial cleanser. I do not have oily skin but it can be oily at times. I decided to give this a try. I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about a week now and I&#x27;ve noticed every since time I use it my face feels very sensitive to the touch and it has a slight burning sensation after it&#x27;s been washed with this stuff. Later in the day after use, I started noticing flaky, dry patches on my face which I&#x27;ve never had before. I thought I just needed to put lotion on my face but after I&#x27;ve put lotion on my face, the patches still reappear. I&#x27;ve never had patches or any burning sensation on my face before using this stuff.  As a matter of fact, my face is in worse condition than it was before I stated using this and my skin was relatively clear. I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that this stuff just isn&#x27;t for me or my skin type.</li>
    <li> For the price great product</li>
    <li> Does what it says. Is very good. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item as a less expensive replacement for my Boscia charcoal cleanser (a huge LOVE, but too pricey). Nothing like it at all. It&#x27;s runny, doesn&#x27;t lather well, and has a decidedly masculine aroma (almost like aftershave). Also, though it doesn&#x27;t say so clearly on the packaging, it does contain salicylic acid, which may be far too drying for some users. Sending back.</li>
    <li> So I got this at Wal-mart but was really pleasantly surprised by how well this cleanser worked for me. I have oily skin (not overly oily, but there are occasional days that I feel like by the end of work I am a little shiny with oil). Here&#x27;s my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) For me this cleanser actually did seem to keep my oily skin not so oily. Maybe it was just placebo effect, but I felt like my skin did have more of a &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; finish throughout the day, but even if that was just in my mind, it did help control oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) I definitely seemed to have clearer skin (or less acne - although I don&#x27;t have much but around my nose)  after using this face wash.  Perhaps it was from the salicylic acid since I haven&#x27;t used a product with that in it for years (probably since I was in high school), but it was kind of a surprise since I&#x27;ve just dealt with a few blemishes by waiting it out (overall I don&#x27;t have much for blemish prone skin but yes, I noticed a difference).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) I really like the smell - it definitely isn&#x27;t floral or girly - but more light menthol/clean scent which I really liked.  Previously I had used Nivea for Men face wash and although it smells good, sometimes I felt like I had too many competing smells (i.e. face wash, deodorant, cologne). This just seems like a clean complementing smell as opposed to guy smell my previous face wash was like. I think the ladies would like it too :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall for me (oily skin, some occasional acne) this worked great.  I really like the smell and really, it is reasonable price too!  Maybe my previous washes (Nivea for Men Deep Cleaning, Basis Cleaner Clean Face Wash) were just bad for me and this was one of the first I tried that worked really well by comparison.  Either way - I like this wash and would highly recommend it for guys too!</li>
    <li> Although I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m completely oil free for the entire day. However, what I can say is that this product has worked the best out of anything that I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;Usually, my face gets pretty oily after washing with a product within the first 30 minutes or so. With this face wash, I can go a couple of hours completely oil free and by the end of the day, still only have half the amount of oil on my skin than I used to.</li>
    <li> The best it really cleans your pores and makes them less noticeable my package came really fast like a week after I purchased it the price was great too I would definitely recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any change in my oily skin from using this product. Waste of money imo.</li>
