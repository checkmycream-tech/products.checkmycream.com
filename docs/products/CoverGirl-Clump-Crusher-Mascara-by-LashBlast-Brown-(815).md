      <li>Love the color.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the brush on this applicator.  </li>
      <li>I love the way the Covergirl Clump Crusher Mascara works.</li>

      <li>all Cover Girl mascaras, this also comes off easily, with just some eye makeup remover or face wash and water.  </li>

      <li>Otherwise it is merely fine.</li>
      <li>-- this is a light touch</li>
      <li>This shade is perfect for those who have no desire to pile on the heavy ear coloring mask.</li>

      <li>crusher works great no clumps of mascara on your lashes &amp; they actually look longer and fuller</li>
      <li>curved brush on this also does a nice job of adding a gentle curl to your lashes.</li>
      <li>It goes on easier than the cheap NYC Color brand.</li>
      <li>I found my new favorite mascara after receiving this as a gift!</li>
      <li>I originally ordered it as an &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; to my order and was lured by the price.  </li>
      <li>At first I wasnt sure what i would think of this one</li>
      <li>It gives a nice, natural, beautiful long lash look.  </li>
      <li>Nothing special about it though.</li>
      <li>As expected and makes my lashes look great.</li>
      <li>First of all I love the bright green packaging totally cute.</li>
      <li>It is true that there are no clumps.</li>

      <li>think it&#x27;s my new favorite mascara.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite mascara.</li>

      <li>Overall, a very good deal, especially with Amazon prices and P&amp;G coupons.</li>
      <li>Great for everyday use-</li>

      <li>free and long love it</li>
      <li>Nice mascara, it does flake a little but easy to wipe off.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve already had good luck using the regular Lash Blast (the one in the orange tube), but I thought I&#x27;d try this new one to see how it works.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this! A girls must have on her makeup stash! Cheap but beautiful</li>
    <li> it is very good . exceed my expectation</li>
    <li> Speaking as one of the 11% of Scotland (and their descendants) that has red hair, I&#x27;m convinced we have our own type of contact dermatitis.  I can&#x27;t wear a lot of commercially produced eye makeup--only NYX Doll Eyes and this won&#x27;t leave me with itchy, runny eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also very natural looking and goes well with auburn hair.  It doesn&#x27;t flake off over the course of a long workday.  You can even nap in it, and it won&#x27;t leave racoon eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s my new favorite mascara.</li>
    <li> Great mascara for the price. Color is nice and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m over 60 years of age with thinning eyelashes and extremely sensitive eyes and skin.  This mascara is fantastic!  Love the curved brush as it makes it very easy to apply. My eyelashes are defined, fuller and longer but don&#x27;t look fake or extravagant.</li>
    <li> This mascara definitely leaves no clumps.  Otherwise it is merely fine. I have the brown color. When I wear it, my lashes look a little better than natural. The formula is pretty thin. Definitely doors not make lakes look longer or fuller. It goes on easier than the cheap NYC Color brand. I&#x27;d buy it again for a dollar or two. Not worth full price. Also, be very careful while applying. If you poke yourself with the brush, it hurts like hell.</li>
    <li> When they say &amp;#34;no clumps&amp;#34; they mean it! I&#x27;ve probably tried a dozen mascaras over the past few years, from drugstore brands to uber expensive brands, and have found none that can beat this formulation of lashblast. Plus, they are one of the very rare to offer a true brown color (rather than a &amp;#34;black brown&amp;#34;) which is essential to a natural look for those with light blonde hair. Even after applying three coats, my lashes stayed smooth, clump-free, and well defined. It&#x27;s not waterproof, but you can&#x27;t have everything.</li>
    <li> better than my department store brands. good for everyday use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the brush. It&#x27;s very rigid and seems to take a lot of applications to get the volume I&#x27;m looking for. I tried something new but won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to mascara ever since it first came out. I used to use lash blast but found that this goes on easier and can hold up to two coats without turning into spider legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend brown if you have blue eyes and fair skin. It looks more natural than black and makes blue eyes pop more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price here as an add-on item is better than the price at Walmart, Target, etc., and if there&#x27;s a coupon on amazon it makes it the lowest price I&#x27;ve ever seen for it anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re used to $30+ mascara, this probably won&#x27;t impress you, but for the price it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> This color is perfect for daily use. It&#x27;s easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t leave behind any clumps or bare areas. I didn&#x27;t need to reapply after a few hours and my gorgeous lashes lasted the entire day. No irritations or problems with this product at all!</li>
    <li> Does what it says.  My new favorite.</li>
    <li> Goes on easily and looks natural.  Don&#x27;t recommend this is you are looking for thickness -- this is a light touch and it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I have stick straight eyelashes, and this mascara definitely doesn&#x27;t hold a curl. It gives great volume and length though, and is amazing at getting rid of clumps.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara!  I got a great deal on the brown and I use it as a base under my younique 3d lashes.  It works great!</li>
    <li> No clumps but no volume either. It is fine as everyday mascara and it looks natural (brown color usually does), but I was hoping for something more drammatic. Overall is ok for a natural &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; look and is cheaper than in pharmacy.</li>
    <li> Really separates your lashes!</li>
    <li> Good Product to be expected from covergirl all their mascara&#x27;s are pretty awesome!</li>
    <li> Not a bad product but I prefer Maybelline but my sister loves it.</li>
    <li> This mascara goes on nicely and stays on well.  I just wish it were light brown color.</li>
    <li> I wish more of the product came off onto my lashes, I feel like I have to keep applying and applying.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Love the color.</li>
    <li> This is a good mascara, easy to apply, stays on, it doesn&#x27;t crumple or smear, but at the same time, it doesn&#x27;t have any overly impressive effects and I&#x27;m looking forward to try something else once I&#x27;m done with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always bought the drugstore Covergirl Clump crusher mascara but figured I would give this one a try since its a lot cheaper. I decided to purchases the brown mascara but when I finally applied it on my dark lashes, I&#x27;ll admit the color looked a bit clownish. I suppose the color isn&#x27;t for me since I am a dark-haired girl, so please be careful what color you choose. I wanted to go for a &amp;#34;natural look&amp;#34; with brown lashes but maybe if you&#x27;re a blond, this brown will fulfill the &amp;#34;natural look&amp;#34; I expected.</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara !</li>
    <li> Love this mascara.  It is true that there are no clumps.</li>
    <li> love this! no clumping and easy to apply!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the brush on this applicator.  The brown shade was a gift to me, so when I reorder, I will order black just based on personal preference.  However, everything about the formula and the applicator are fantastic! I found my new favorite mascara after receiving this as a gift! This mascara lasts for most of the day, although if I were going to work all day and then go out at night, I would probably reapply.  The brush does an amazing job separating my lashes for maximum volume.  Overall, my favorite mascara!</li>
    <li> I am not one to get particularly attached to any one mascara and this didn&#x27;t change that. It worked. Nothing special about it though.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my teen daughter who loves the color. Last all day and is easy to remove at night.</li>
    <li> I purchased this covergirl mascara in 2014 from a CvS pharmacy. I prefer browns during the daytime. First of all black mascara suits females in the evening. Browns tend to give you that &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; look. For nearly 27yrs I have worn covergirl mascara. Especially due to the fact in the 1980&#x27;s it was so cheap. This shade is perfect for those who have no desire to pile on the heavy ear coloring mask.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara! It&#x27;s the perfect color and always smooth.</li>
    <li> Great mascara though I tried the brown and wasnt too fond of that color. It was easy to apply though.</li>
    <li> Mascara works super and for sure no clumping and the brush you can rinse out and use with other mascaras because it is amazing for separating tiny lashes and preventing clumping</li>
    <li> Bought it because it is hard to find brown mascara. Wish cosmetic companies would understand that fair women may want to not have vamped out lashes! However this actually created lumps and clumps. Tired it four times then threw it out.</li>
    <li> I plan to order more if the price remains low.  it is a good product.  The brush looks weird but somehow it works.</li>
    <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve found, and non-clumping, non-irritating.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Wish it was a bit wetter. Purchased it because it was sold in the brown.  Most other mascaras advertised and sold in black.  Will repurchase.</li>
    <li> I used to pay much money for makeup.  So foolish!  This stuff is perfect for me, but I like a more natural look.  If you like the lengthening, thickening ones, it&#x27;s probably not for you.  If you want the lengthening, thickening one, you probably want the double extend beauty tubes.</li>
    <li> Clump Crusher!  How about clump creator.  I spent more time undoing the resulting clumps than I spent applying the mascara.  I originally ordered it as an &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; to my order and was lured by the price.  A mistake on my part.</li>
    <li> Product works very well. Lengthens and separates lashes, and doesn&#x27;t clump. I found my new mascara!</li>
    <li> This mascara color is great, the wand is great - however this product arrived basically dried out. On the brightside i may take the wand out and use it for another mascara because it seperate the lashes very well.</li>
    <li> Great product at a price I could not refuse.  Under $5!  Does not clump.</li>
    <li> If you are going to buy a less expensive mascara I would buy the 2 step Lorreal, it really extends the lashes and comes right off.</li>
    <li> Well, maybe I was hoping for magic. I have thin lashes and was hoping that this mascara would make them fuller. It&#x27;s probably better than the other Cover Girl mascara I was using, but it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but find that it clumps as bad as any other mascara.</li>
    <li> Although I ordered the wrong color (brown) instead of black, this is still the best mascara I have used in the last 15 years.  It is not hard, sticky, clumpy or hard to remove.  It goes on effortless and comes off just as easy with soap and warm water.  This will be MY mascara from now on.</li>
    <li> My new favorite mascara!!!!  Really full looking lashes and not very many clumps.  Overall, a very good deal, especially with Amazon prices and P&amp;G coupons.</li>
    <li> love this mascara. it glides on, never clumps, and you can see its BROWN. I like the curved brush also.  Good for the price.  Couldn&#x27;t find it in stores around my area.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara. Wished it was black instead of brown but oh well</li>
    <li> This product does not stay on long enough and flakes off especially in hot weather.</li>
    <li> I love not having any flakes on my face all day.  It gives a nice, natural, beautiful long lash look.  And the brown looks so much less harsh than black, since I don&amp;#34;t have black hair!</li>
    <li> Certainly can&#x27;t say &amp;#34;zero clumps&amp;#34;  few clumps, sure. But for a product that specifically advertises &amp;#34;zero&amp;#34; I would expect to see much less. With that said, it&#x27;s still a very good mascara.  It does everything else as advertised- lots of volume coating every lash.  Great for everyday use- it does flake a little (at least for me) but nothing a little refresh can&#x27;t handle.</li>
    <li> Love the long lashes without the clumps!</li>
    <li> While I occasionally splurge on Buxom Lash mascara, my tried and true mascaras seem to be the newer series of Cover Girl ones that have come out in the last few years or [[ASIN:B0047W3QBW Almay One Coat Get Up and Grow Mascara, Black, 0.21-Ounce]].  While some folks hate the large brush and tube of these newer ones, I don&#x27;t mind them, and I love the new bristle brushes that coat without leaving clumps.  I&#x27;ve already had good luck using the regular Lash Blast (the one in the orange tube), but I thought I&#x27;d try this new one to see how it works.  I really like it, and it really does leave zero clumps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curved brush on this also does a nice job of adding a gentle curl to your lashes. The non-waterproof formula stays put, even when my allergies are acting up and my eyes are teary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this in the Very Black color, and it&#x27;s still natural-looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like all Cover Girl mascaras, this also comes off easily, with just some eye makeup remover or face wash and water.  You don&#x27;t have to tug or pull at your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
    <li> great it leaves my lashes looking clump free and long love it</li>
    <li> Simply application.  I experienced no clumping even after a full day of wear.</li>
    <li> First of all I love the bright green packaging totally cute. I have this in very black in water resistant. I love the shape of the wand</li>
    <li> At first I wasnt sure what i would think of this one but I was shocked to see this stuff really works! Zero clumps! My lashes have noticeably more volume AND stay separate! They&#x27;re natural-looking, even with two coats (which I don&#x27;t really need). I was a little wary that the formula wasn&#x27;t waterproof, but it actually stayed on--no raccoon eyes by the end of the day. I love this stuff! It&#x27;s my new favorite mascara.</li>
    <li> After years of trying every mascara under the sun, from maybelline to Dior, this is my very favorite mascara. It seems to me that a lot of popular mascaras these days are VERY heavy and clumpy and everyone is running around with tarantula lashes. On the other end of the mascara spectrum are those watery formulas that are barely lash tints. This is a perfect compromise. Enough oomph to be noticeable, I&#x27;ve used different applications for both more natural and more made up looks, but it really doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
    <li> I am a male and use this on my eyebrows to make them look darker.  It covers the gray brows.</li>
    <li> Great product no clumps and lasts all day</li>
    <li> great price for a great product. love the color, made lashes appear fuller</li>
    <li> I have used the product two times and so far happy with it.  The brush is nice and not clumpy.  Seems to stay on well.</li>
    <li> i hate clumpy mascara and this is one of the best &amp;#34;no-clump&amp;#34; mascaras that I have found (especially given the reasonable price).  the applicator wand has long soft bristles that work like a comb to apply and separate lashes.  also does not flake or wear-off during the day.  great price on amazon.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find a brown mascara in the drug stores for years. This is a nice medium brown and works perfectly for me.</li>
    <li> this is an amazing product and we use it often</li>
    <li> I am in love with this mascara!</li>
    <li> I only needed to apply this 1 time a day. I like the whole line of CoverGirl. I didnt have any issues of clumping, which is annoying. Im glad I bought this!</li>
    <li> This mascara&#x27;s curved applicator does ensure non-clumping and I really like the way it looks. I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> The price that I paid for this mascara was a bargain but I&#x27;m displeased that the color did last long</li>
    <li> The Covergirl clump  crusher works great no clumps of mascara on your lashes &amp; they actually look longer and fuller</li>
    <li> product as described--shipped in 2 days</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this in mascara at target. Goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t clump. Also nice color, I rarely use black mascara because it&#x27;s too intense for daytime use. I will buy this mascara again.</li>
    <li> Mascara is a little less moist than I like.</li>
    <li> I love the way the Covergirl Clump Crusher Mascara works. It works better than other similar products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this brand of mascara! Like it states, it doesn&#x27;t clump up and looks really great when applied! I like the brush shape especially! I typically use black mascara but brown can be great for a more subtle spring look!</li>
    <li> Great product. As expected and makes my lashes look great. I don&#x27;t usually wear a lot of mascara but it is no hassle and doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
    <li> While I appreciate this item it doesn&#x27;t seem to load sufficiently,  also, I prefer black, which may account for my lack of enthusiasm.</li>
    <li> Nice mascara, it does flake a little but easy to wipe off. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This mascara does not clump at all. However, I much prefer the lash blast from cover girl. This does not provide any volume.</li>
    <li> It add so much volume on my lashes just use a little bit. Even the color i purchase is brown but it looks natural and not looks too dramatically &amp;#34; loud &amp;#34; that you have to let everybody notice you apply mascara . I like it.</li>
    <li> I use this mascara to color my hair. It works better than the kind that&#x27;s sold for the hair because it&#x27;s not sticky and obvious,it really blends in nicely and lasts all day. The brush is better also so it covers those small fine hairs around temples and looks really natural not too dark.</li>
