      <li>Smaller than normal spin pins, and not as smooth so they easily get stuck and rip your hair.</li>
      <li>Neat little tool to tidy your hair.</li>

    <li> i am happy to have found these cheap here (was originally considering hair spin pin from Goody Simple). I bought so many of them at once. I have asian black hair so the color works great. I have been using it so often since I got pregnant just to get my hair all tidied. I have not experienced any sort of uncomfortable scratches during usage. I do have quite stubbornly straight hair (again, asian hair), so I find myself working the best with the making a bun when I use 3 screws instead of 2.</li>
    <li> These were a knockoff of the originals.</li>
    <li> The description says that this is 2pkgs of 2 pins for a total of 4 pins.  I received 2pkgs of 1pin each for a total of 2 pins.  So instead of getting a pretty good price I overpaid!</li>
    <li> The clips work ok. They don&#x27;t have the little balls at the tips, It&#x27;s just like raw metal and It&#x27;s not filed very well so it gets caught on my hair sometimes. I don&#x27;t mind the pain thought. I just wish i had gotten bigger ones cause for these to hold I have to first put my hair in a pony tail, spin the clips in, and sometimes even ADD another pony tail band around the bun to make sure it won&#x27;t fall out.. I do however have fine hair and It&#x27;s long but in layers. So if yours is thicker and more even or just longer you may don&#x27;t them easier to use. Over all I like them.</li>
    <li> These are awesome, for any hair. I have really long, really thick hair and the four pins together held it up all day and made a really nice bun. Getting some for everyone for Christmas!</li>
    <li> Neat little tool to tidy your hair.</li>
    <li> these work but the ends are not smooth enouth  - I need to find a way to smooth out the ends so it goes in my hair smoothly and not damage.</li>
    <li> Ends are sharp. Medal is thin so they don&#x27;t hold well when twisted into hair.</li>
    <li> The ends DO NOT have the little ball point as it shows in photo! They poke your scalp. I would not purchase again. I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Smaller than normal spin pins, and not as smooth so they easily get stuck and rip your hair. I guess buying brand name does sometimes make a difference.</li>
    <li> Sent them back - sharp edges and flimsy - also said there were 2 sets but I only got one set. Not sure if the seller knows English to know that 2 sets means 4 pins. It doesn&#x27;t mean that 1 pin is 1 set. Sigh!</li>
    <li> Do not purchase they have very sharp ends. Complete waste of money!</li>
    <li> I love it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really works and it is very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this item. You can use it on any type of hair.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this thru a different seller after I purchased these.  They have the idea but they did not add the rubbery ends on the end of the bobby pin.  The metal scratches your scalp and pulls out hairs.  I absolutely love the new ones I have with the soft tips! They are a must have!</li>
    <li> These are great for keeping my hair  up or in place when I go out. The only problem I have with them is that they are not quite as durable as the Goody spin pins in that these bend a little and whereas the Goody ones don&#x27;t. These are still great and at the price I got them for compared to the Goody ones I am thrilled. I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Very sharp on the ends, do not recommend!</li>
    <li> These are great! I twist my hair into a bun and these hold it into place! Such a great tool for your hair! I wish I would have gotten them years ago!</li>
    <li> It said there were two spin pin clips in the package, but I only received one.  I was very disappointed.  One is not enough, my hair is very long.</li>
    <li> These are excellent for the beach, a very easy way to throw your hair up without the fumbling and loss of typical bobby pins.</li>
    <li> Love the pins, daughters hair stays put while in a bun</li>
    <li> Outstanding - keeps hair in place all day</li>
    <li> First, the seller only sent ONE SET (as in two pins) instead of the clearly stated &amp;#34;2 packages containing two pins each&amp;#34; that is described.  Someone else had the same problem, so I&#x27;m thinking this is probably not the best way to buy these, even if it looks like the cheaper way to go.  Amazon did fix the issue by refunding half the price, but still, I would have rather had the pins and the extra annoyance sucked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pins themselves work as advertised.  It takes some getting used to but they do hold hair into a slightly messy bun (it is not going to look perfect... well at least is does not for me) but still better than a quick messy bun I would do with a hair tie.</li>
