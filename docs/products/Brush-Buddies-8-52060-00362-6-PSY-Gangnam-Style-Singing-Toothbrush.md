      <li>Makes the 2 minute brushing minimum fun and definitely helps us keep on track.  </li>
      <li>but overall worth the money.</li>
      <li>This was fun but only lasted about 3 weeks.  </li>
      <li>the songs never worked that well, even with brand new batteries.  </li>

      <li>Bought this for my 9 year old.</li>
      <li>Not worth the cost, although it was fun while it lasted.</li>
      <li>I purchased other singing toothbrushes to switch off, so he doesn&#x27;t wear it out too fast.  </li>
      <li>Now, if you&#x27;re lucky enough to get it to come on, it will only be for a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> The bristles on the brush wore out long before the battery did, so I guess he&#x27;s brushing his teeth, which has always been a struggle!</li>
<li> EVERY single night, he uses it, and dances along with the song, he&#x27;s even made up a routine to go with it!</li>
<li> Brushing head is a little on the small side, even for a 7 year old.</li>
<li> See my review for 8-52060-00328-2, the other brush buddies I purchased for my children...</li>
<li> This is a poorly constructed, super flimsy, super junky piece of crud with a tiny horrible sounding speaker on the bottom that plays Gangman Style in the the most horrible, slowed down, tinny, distorted way imaginable.</li>
<li> The toothbrush itself is a little skimpy and there isn&#x27;t an attachable head</li>
<li> It sounds so bad it&#x27;s hardly recognizable.</li>
<li> My little boy loves it!</li>
<li> It will randomly turn on when no one is in the room, but when you actually press the button, it may or may not turn on.</li>
<li> Plays music but the bristles are a bit weak and tend to fall out.</li>
<li> This is a poor knockoff.</li>
<li> So disappointing!</li>
<li> I was disappointed it wasn&#x27;t a spinbrush and</li>
<li> Although the song is annoying, my son loves it and it encourages him to brush his teeth longer.  </li>
<li> my son was very disappointed that the toothbrush did NOT work!!</li>
<li> a week - grandson was very disappointed !</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It stopped working after a couple weeks and no way to change the battery. What a joke.</li>
    <li> This thing is a piece of junk. We previously had a Tooth Tunes toothbrush, and the song it played came in clearly and using some sort of cool conductive sound technology where it was actually broadcast right into your mouth. It sounded about as good as anyone could reasonably expect a $10 toothbrush for 6 year olds would sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s not this toothbrush. This is a poorly constructed, super flimsy, super junky piece of crud with a tiny horrible sounding speaker on the bottom that plays Gangman Style in the the most horrible, slowed down, tinny, distorted way imaginable. It sounds so bad it&#x27;s hardly recognizable. It also sounds like it&#x27;s ready to die after a week of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stick with the Tooth Tunes brands. This is a poor knockoff. Not the same thing at all.</li>
    <li> Brought for my son and I wish it worked better. It sounds if the battery is about to die and on some days it don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 9 year old son for Christmas, and he LOVES it! EVERY single night, he uses it, and dances along with the song, he&#x27;s even made up a routine to go with it! LOL  Bristles are medium size and stiffness,, perfect for my boy.  We all have been very entertained by this toothbrush, my son loves the song and dancing, and we love to watch him perform!</li>
    <li> my grandson asked me to buy him a musical tooth brush. I think he is going to like it.</li>
    <li> My son LOVES this toothbrush! I wish it were mechanical, but it&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it stopped working IMMEDIATELY. It will randomly turn on when no one is in the room, but when you actually press the button, it may or may not turn on. The first couple of times it did turn on and play the whole 2 minutes. Now, if you&#x27;re lucky enough to get it to come on, it will only be for a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve filed a claim with the seller. So disappointing!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so much fun! My little boy loves it! He thinks he has to brush his teeth 6 times a day! He loves to dance to the music while brushing!</li>
    <li> Makes the 2 minute brushing minimum fun and definitely helps us keep on track.  We love the timer with this song on this item.  It really makes a difference.  Now we even use it all over the house, when we need a 2 minute timer (we seem to need it for multiple uses on a daily basis).</li>
    <li> Ordered two&lt;br /&gt;One wasn&#x27;t working to begin with&lt;br /&gt;Second one stopped working after 2days</li>
    <li> This is his favorite toothbrush.  I purchased other singing toothbrushes to switch off, so he doesn&#x27;t wear it out too fast.  Although he plays the music after he finishes brushing, so that he can dance to it.</li>
    <li> It was cute a And the kids enjoyed it.  I was disappointed it wasn&#x27;t a spinbrush and the batteries are not replaceable.  So once it stops working it&#x27;s done.</li>
    <li> My son LOVES Gangnam Style so this brush was PERFECT. The sound quality isn&#x27;t that great, but he didn&#x27;t notice. The bristles on the brush wore out long before the battery did, so I guess he&#x27;s brushing his teeth, which has always been a struggle!</li>
    <li> Battery died in a week.</li>
    <li> t only worked for a week - grandson was very disappointed ! Should have returned this but threw away all packaging too quickly...</li>
    <li> My nephew loves and it.</li>
    <li> Fun for my kids. Just wish it had an interchangeable head.</li>
    <li> My grandson will love it when he gets it!</li>
    <li> Plays music but the bristles are a bit weak and tend to fall out.</li>
    <li> This was fun but only lasted about 3 weeks.  You can&#x27;t replace the battery.</li>
    <li> The bristles fall out</li>
    <li> SO much better than Turbo Tooth tunes.  The song plays at a comfortable, audible level.  The toothbrush itself is a little skimpy and there isn&#x27;t an attachable head but overall worth the money.</li>
    <li> What can I say? It&#x27;s easier to get the kids to brush their teeth!</li>
    <li> No problems with the toothbrush&#x27;s function.  It is still.  Going.  Strong.  Although the song is annoying, my son loves it and it encourages him to brush his teeth longer.  Win!!</li>
    <li> After only a couple weeks, the toothbrush stopped working without any way to change batteries. Not worth the cost, although it was fun while it lasted.</li>
    <li> See my review for 8-52060-00328-2, the other brush buddies I purchased for my children... the songs never worked that well, even with brand new batteries.  Also some of the bristles started coming out right away.</li>
    <li> i would not purchase from the provider in the future, AT ALL. my son was very disappointed that the toothbrush did NOT work!!</li>
    <li> Toothbrush was exciting for my son for the first couple day. Quality of the toothbrush was very low. Even after changing the batteries a few times, the sound of the music has gotten lower and lower. Even now the music cuts in and out of the song. All I can say is, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Purchased for a 6th grader, loves it!  The only con for this product..there is no info with product on replacing the battery.  There are 2 holes for where a battery might go but it is seal with plastic over it.  Toothbrush is very lightweight and the song plays loudly.  Still worth the price!</li>
    <li> Awesome toothbrush. Brushing head is a little on the small side, even for a 7 year old.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 9 year old. He loved it, but it&#x27;s already dead. Worked great for a little over a month. Then suddenly died. No place to change the battery so I feel scammed.</li>
