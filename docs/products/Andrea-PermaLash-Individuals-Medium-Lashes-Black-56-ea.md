<ol>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m crazy but it seemed like they were going to come with glue.  Was I wrong?  Now I&#x27;m not sure where to get glue.</li>
    <li> I wear individual lashes everyday. Andrea lashes are the best!</li>
    <li> The only way to buy them verses Sally&#x27;s  selling them 5.00 a pack</li>
    <li> This item was as describe.</li>
    <li> I love the lashes.  I have used them before.  I thought i was ordering one set.  I got 4.  In the detailed description it states that glue comes with it.  IT DOES NOT COME WITH GLUE!!! thanks a lot for nothing.  all they can do is sit on a shelf till i find some glue at my non-existant beauty supply stores.</li>
    <li> when I bought these lashes it said (pack of 4), and I only received one.  I would not have paid that price If I knew I was only getting one package of the lashes.</li>
    <li> I love it! It&#x27;s very simple to put on and it lasts a long time too. I love how it looks and feels</li>
    <li> In comparison to Ardell (the other Sally&#x27;s brand), these are not AS soft and natural looking, BUT, these do not crease and bend! I prefer the look of the Ardell lashes, but that isn&#x27;t worth a flip when the next morning they are creased and bent. I applied Andrea perma lashes 3 days ago and they look just like the day I put them on. I will use these going forward over the other brand.</li>
    <li> Too long to look natural.</li>
    <li> These are natural looking, last for days, are waterproof with the singles eyelash glue and can even be worn swimming.</li>
    <li> These are the ones with the knots on the end.  I didn&#x27;t realize that when I purchased them, but have learned how to use them as well as the more natural ones without the knots.  They do come off the packaging much easier than the ones without the knots, which is great.

    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing false lashes for a couple of years.  Started with professionally done lash extensions, which cost me about $150/month to maintain.  My natural lashes began falling out and became thin.  I love using the PermaLash clusters.  I wear the medium black clusters with knots. They will stay on for a week easily.  Just don&#x27;t get them very wet as the glue will go.  PermaLash is much better than DuraLash.  They last longer and are easier to get out of the container.  I&#x27;ve ruined many DuraLashes as they pull apart just trying to remove them from the tray.  My cost now... less than $10/month!  And I like them better than the professional ones.  If I want to swim, I just wash them off then put on a new set later for about $4.  It takes me about 20 minutes!</li>
    <li> I have reccomend this product to family and friends. They look real, because there not to long. If applied correctly.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on as well... The medium are actually long!</li>
    <li> These lashes are the best! I have been using them for years! If you are familiar with flare lashes you know they are NOT all the same. Some have a sticky adhesive on the bottom tip that is difficult to remove without damaging the lashes. Permalash have the tiniest bit of glue (to adhere to the box) and it comes off in a second if you prefer (but it&#x27;s really not necessary). I use it with the tiniest bit of the DUO  adhesive and my lashes stay on for weeks! I just re-do them every few days as one or two will fall off at night. These lashes have the perfect curve and color. Everyone always thinks my lashes are real! It&#x27;s hard for me to lie about them, but I should start to!</li>
    <li> Lashes look like real lashes. When I put them on they don&#x27;t look fake.  I order the medium and short lashes  together but they shipped them separately and have not received the shorts yet</li>
    <li> I use these all of the time and really like these better than the Ardell brand.  Andrea Permalash is easier to remove from the package whereas when removing the Ardell flairs that little ball of glue used to hold them in the package remains on the lash which is quite annoying.  I haven&#x27;t had that problem with the Andrea brand.</li>
    <li> Wow!!!  These were sooo easy to apply!  I watched a couple of videos on youtube to prep before they came in!!! I am telling everyone how easy it is to apply and also how much cheaper it is than the salon!  I paid $35 to get them done and they were suppose to last two wks but only lasted three days...these have already been on for a week!  I will never go to a salon again!!!</li>
    <li> Ordered this early, by the time I opened to use, it was past the return date.  They sent short instead of medium &#x3D; unuseable for me.</li>
    <li> I sort of bought these on a whim for a special occasion. I used to have long lashes, but as I have gotten older, they don&#x27;t seem as nice as they once were. I have tried lots of mascaras and that helps (plus my lashes aren&#x27;t dark in color), but sometimes it is annoying to always put it on. I read some reviews and chose these and the [[ASIN:B0035LCW0W Ardell Lashtite Adhesive, Dark]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I watched a bunch of videos on how to put them on. I have worn strips before (like for halloween! ha ha!) but they don&#x27;t look natural. These aren&#x27;t THAT different to put on, just more time consuming. And the trick is...put them on the very base of your lashes, NOT your skin. Here is what I did:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Get your tweezers (you need tweezers...I like the pointy ones like these [[ASIN:B000EMYHA8 Tweezerman&#x27;s]] because I have good control, but you may prefer the fla-tip kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Put your tweezers at the very bottom of the lashes in the tray close to the knot. They glue them in there and you are trying to pop them off without denting or breaking your cluster. Pop off one and just lay it on your surface (or even your hand.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Squirt a little puddle glue on a small piece of foil or plastic. Like less than a dime size is fine. I just used a shiny tag I had just removed from a dress! Why waste another item when recycling is fine?! :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Pick up your lash cluster with your tweezers; THIS TIME by the tip end (not the knot.) Don&#x27;t squeeze hard, you can accidentally crimp them. Just enough to hold them. Make sure you have the curl UP...like a cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Lightly drag the knot through the surface of the puddle of glue. If you dip, you are more apt to get a glob. Dragging is better. You can even keep dragging to remove some if you pick up too much...it will come off sort of like painting with a brush! You can always re-drag, but getting a glob off your lashes is a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Look in your magnifying mirror and lift your chin up. Don&#x27;t try to squeeze your eye shut, just lift your chin and your lid will close enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. The hardest part!! (which isn&#x27;t really that hard): Lay your glue tipped lash on top of your natural lashes. Try to get that knot as close as you can to the roots of your lashes, but NOT on your skin. The glue is going to fuse the false cluster to your real lashes. You might want to experiment BEFORE you dip in glue to see generally where you want the cluster to be (such as toward the middle or more toward the side.) You will have a few seconds to adjust/slightly reposition before the glue sets. I seem to do best by laying them close, then using the tweezers to push them back a little toward the roots. Even if you hit your skin, just use your tweezers to slide them out a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. Give that cluster a minute or two to set, then go to the next one! I use about 4 per eye. That is enough for me. Feel free to lay them there without glue first to see where you are going to place your cluster. You can&#x27;t wait too long to figure it out once you drag through the glue...the glue will \\&quot;skin\\&quot; over and not stick. And putting them on and then taking it off will result in a random bit of glue on your lashes. Not the worst thing in the world...especially if you were careful to not have a glob.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. That&#x27;s it!! Now flutter your eyes provocatively at your beautiful self in the mirror!! :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find these lashes slightly long for me. They just didn&#x27;t match my real ones closely enough. For an evening out or something, I liked them a little more dramatic. For work, I DID try to slightly trim some in the tray for a more natural length, but the hairs weren&#x27;t as nice and tapered then. :/ Not too too obvious, but not perfect. With a touch of mascara, you couldn&#x27;t notice my haircut! :D I am here buying some shorter ones to mix and match lengths on my eyes (no more trimming...but in a pinch it was fine.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine lasted a 2 days even WITH waterproof mascara. Afterremoving it though, most lashes came with the oily remover. I knew they would, but didn&#x27;t care. It was just for a special event. You would want to stick with non-waterproof mascara (if you wanted to use any) to maintain your lashes longer. You will need some oily remover to get them off. Let the product do the work, don&#x27;t pull. Or just let them fall off of their own over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like them! I really didn&#x27;t have much trouble even as a novice.  Have fun with them..even if you totally screw up, just toss those few and remove the glue with oily remover. They aren&#x27;t that expensive per cluster. Make sure you WASH that off before trying again though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to try slightly shorter and the no-knot kind, too. You can only slightly see the knot...and that was with the magnifying mirror. But the non-knot type seem harder to place. I will try them next, compare and update my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I just used [[ASIN:B003ZS8MCM these shorter versions]] and the COMBINATION is awesome! I used the longer ones here more toward the middle and outside of my lids, 2 or 3 per eye; and filled in any sparse areas with those shorter ones. VERY natrual look and I haven&#x27;t needed mascara for a WEEK!! nice! (actually, i have light hair and going out one night I did a touch of mascara on the bottom lashes only...don&#x27;t put falsies there!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed there is a groove in the tray near the bottoms of the lashes. If you use pointy tweezers, the tweezers will slide right in the groove and you can get the lashes out easily and accurately. You have to reposition the lash in the tweezers before gluing and placing (I just drop them on the back of my hand after I pull them out) since you don&#x27;t want the tweezers so close to the base to place.removing it though, most lashes came with the oily remover. I knew they would, but didn&#x27;t care. It was just for a special event. You would want to stick with non-waterproof mascara (if you wanted to use any) to maintain your lashes longer. You will need some oily remover to get them off. Let the product do the work, don&#x27;t pull. Or just let them fall off of their own over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like them! I really didn&#x27;t have much trouble even as a novice.  Have fun with them..even if you totally screw up, just toss those few and remove the glue with oily remover. They aren&#x27;t that expensive per cluster. Make sure you WASH that off before trying again though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to try slightly shorter and the no-knot kind, too.

    <li> I really like these. They dont really look natural, but when applied properly they&#x27;re barely visible. I first saw these when I paid a bunch of money for eyelash extensions, I put them on w ardell lashtite adhesive and they last about a week.</li>
