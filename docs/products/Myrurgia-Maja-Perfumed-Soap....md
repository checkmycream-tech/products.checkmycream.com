<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I got this for my sweetheart, and she loved it.  So I am a happy customer too  :-)</li>
    <li> I have used nothing but this Maja soap from Spain since I first tried it. It is the only thing that keeps my hands from feeling like sand-paper in the winter. I like the 4.9 oz. Bars best. The smaller size isn&#x27;t as long lasting. The 4.9 oz. Bar lasts a long time. This is my annual birthday gift from my son - along with the body lotion and dusting powder. I buy the Eau De Toilette Spray for myself because I love Maja everything!  Treat yourself to these wonderful Maja products!</li>
    <li> So disappointed.  Hardly smells like the Maja of old.  I returned it.</li>
    <li> As a teenager I received Maja bar soap and fell for the heady aroma. I am still fascinated by the alluring scent, but I would like to see smaller bars of this soap in the future as they would be easier to handle.</li>
    <li> In the early 60&#x27;s my grandparents spent the winter in Spain. My grandmother brought me back 4 Maja soaps and a container of the dusting powder.  After over 40 years I still have the original container and pink puff from the dusting powder,I refill it with the talc. And i still have a small sliver left from the original 3 soaps. That small sliver STILL has the scent.    I was so happy to find it online. It has always been my favorite scent. It calms me</li>
    <li> it just doesn&#x27;t have the same smell i remember. it&#x27;s nice, but there is an undertone that is a tiny bit harsh. But it is soap...so all in all it works....lol  I think it being made in Mexico and not Spain....maybe the recipe is a bit different?</li>
    <li> time to order some more......splendid!</li>
    <li> Wonderful scented soap. It leaves skin smooth and not dry. I first found this soap and perfume in Spain. It has a wonder oriental spice  aroma! This is hard to find in the States. Thrilled that Amazon carries this product!</li>
    <li> I grew up with this soap, given as Christmas presents. In my family the soap would be kept in a drawer with handkerchiefs and other small linens. The perfume is understated and beautiful, slightly woodsy, also spicy and a muted floral tone. So many perfumes are glorified bug-spray or bus-bathroom deodorant caliber. Maja is a fine sachet that will not cause your neighbor in the theater to cringe or cause anyone to have an asthma attack. How nice that it is available on Amazon.</li>
    <li> There are many different Maja soap products, some are not from Spain. I look for the box which says 4.9 ounces, round soap. This soap is wonderful to place in luggage, linen shelves, chests, drawers or wherever you want a nice clean scent. I still have some old soap from 1980, purchased in Spain, which I had cut in half and placed in an old trunk, the blankets still smell fresh.&lt;br /&gt;The trick is to find the right kind, there are many \\&quot;look alike\\&quot; soaps.</li>
    <li> Subtle woodsy smell, rich lather.  I love this soap!</li>
    <li> My favorite soap because of the scent.  It is somewhat drying.</li>
    <li> Wow! I&#x27;ve been looking for Maja products for over 30 years now. I thought it was a discontinued product until I happened to Google it. The soap is absolutely wonderful. After using it the fragrance lasts and lasts. Maja means, &#x27;beautiful woman&#x27; and I can&#x27;t help but feel beautiful when I use it. This is a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> One of two favorites here. Usually have Magno and Maja out for shower and shower.  Nice contrast</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t even know it was still around - i remember it from years ago.  i was happy to see it - it smells exactly as i remember it.  i thought the company went out of business years ago (hmmm, maybe it did and this is leftover??) - but anyway, happy to have a few bars again.</li>
    <li> great old-fashioned fragranced soaps</li>
    <li> it was tan color and smelled like tar and perfume</li>
    <li> My mom loves these soaps.  I try and get them for her at least once a year at Christmas time.</li>
    <li> Reminds her of her youth I guess, this is the only soap she wants!!!!! It smells lovely I must say.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. My whole family uses it.</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  My sister surprised me one Christmas with a bar because our mother used it long ago and I had forgotten all about it.  My husband liked it too and I bought him a box of the rectangle soaps for Christmas which he now re-orders.  Have to say, some folks don&#x27;t like the smell but that&#x27;s true of any fragrance.  This is a very nice gift and great to use.</li>
    <li> Just love it, the scent last longer than any other soap, it feels cleaner and refresher.</li>
    <li> My mother always loved this soap. I couldn&#x27;t find it any longer at any drug stores like my mother used to. Thank God I found it at Amazon.com! My mother was absolutely thrilled at receiving it in her hands.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to be the same fragrance as the Jabon I use to get. Maybe the formula has changed. I liked but won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice smelling soap and I have been using it for years. I recommend buying it for the bath.</li>
    <li> Happy, my product received timely with no problems</li>
    <li> Favorite from my childhood. My father used to bring it to my mother from Spain. Unique, earthy, comforting fragrance that leaves skin clean and smooth. Love it. Will order it again and again.</li>
    <li> Love the unique smell of this fine milled soap.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this soap for years, and stocked up on it when I went to Spain. I usually only use handmade local soap products, but I have a weakness for this. Makes a great gift too, using one of the wrapped soaps in a gift basket.I will be back for more....</li>
    <li> I discovered Maja on my first trip into Mexico 30 years ago and have loved using it ever since. The fragrance is like no other on earth and if you shower with these bars, it will stay on you all day, in a good way. They are packaged like the highest-end, luxury toiletries. Highly fragrant, great suds and the feel of lanolin - VERY nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave them 4 stars has nothing to do with Maja, but everything to do with Amazon. Don&#x27;t get me wrong - I love Amazon.com. Like eBay, it is often the only way to buy something I like that is no longer available in the local, even chain markets. I used to even find Maja at Wal-Mart, but no more. What I don&#x27;t like about Amazon is their propensity to bounce prices on stuff like this with no apology and no kind of price guarantee. When I buy something at Wal-Mart or Target, if it goes on sale within 30 days I can go back with my receipt and they&#x27;ll refund me the difference. Not so with Amazon. I just bought this exact item this week for $17.99 and today the price is $15.49, tomorrow it might be $13.99 then back up to $21.99. The same thing happened last month with Season One of Hazel, only the other way round. Bought it for $10.99 and the very next day it was $39.99 and two days later it was back down to $24.99. I understand the idea of supply and demand, but that kind of price bouncing is utterly ridiculous. Amazon ought to put in place some type of price guarantee to avoid the feeling of being gouged. Granted, as I already said, it goes both ways, but there must be a better way to do business even if the prices just remained constant for a couple of weeks at a time instead of changing daily.</li>
    <li> Maja for Women is a wonderful soap- the scent is light and yet stays with you most of the day- the packaging is elegant and the soap itself lasts much longer than most commercial soaps. It arrived earlier than expected- now my search is for the dusting powder by Maja-cannot find it in any stores in my area.</li>
    <li> My wife likes this soap.  It has a fragrance like no other.  My only complaint is the price.  Used to buy it at Ross for one quarter of the Amazon price.  Also disappointed that shipping is not included.  However the product itself deserves five stars.</li>
    <li> Product received did not meet expectations. Maja soaps have a particular fragrance that sticks in your skin softly but present. This was not the case with these soaps. Also during the use of the soap my skin was not being nourished. The soap left my skin dry after using it and it just didn&#x27;t feel right. I have used Maja products in the past and this definitely didn&#x27;t feel like the original stuff. Was very disappointed. :(</li>
    <li> I am always very happy when I smell this soap. It is not produced in Spain like before but it is still the same product. I started using this 40 years ago after my then  future husband gave this to me as a present. THANK YOU for having  this on line.</li>
    <li> I use this soap on a daily basis AND also use it for gift-giving too.  Classy product!  It&#x27;s been around a long time.</li>
    <li> I use the bars of soap as sachets for my lingerie/nightwear drawers. My things have a lovely light aroma that is quite pleasant.</li>
    <li> Love this soap for both men and women!  It is truly delightful.  We bought the lotion as well and will continue to purchase it!</li>
    <li> Contrary to some opinions, this is not the real stuff from Spain. That just isn&#x27;t available anymore except in limited quantities from a few other sites at high cost. This has the dancer pictured, it is the size that some said means it is original, but it isn&#x27;t. It smells ok, but we have some of the real Spanish soap and when compared, this falls way short. All Myrurgia is now made in Mexico. Don&#x27;t bother if you are looking for the soap you used to get years ago from Spain, sorry...</li>
    <li> While the image shows the Spanish version (with the woman dancing) the soap delivered was the Mexican version, with just the red and black colors.  There&#x27;s a slight difference in the aroma.  The difference is strong (and disappointing) when one first opens the box, but it actually settles down in a day or two and become very similar to the original Spanish version.  I&#x27;m 62 and can remember this aroma in my grandfather&#x27;s house, when I was in my teens.</li>
    <li> This has to be the best smelling soap I&#x27;ve ever had. My first boyfriend brought this home from Spain and I loved it ever since. Refreshing and unique in it&#x27;s scent. I wish it was available in a body wash but I have a feeling it&#x27;s impossible to duplicate.</li>
    <li> I found that it left  my skin so soft that I wasn&#x27;t required to slather myself in moisturizer. When her gift of the set of soaps  was gone I had to order for myself and a gift for my daughter and granddaughter.</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift because my Cousin always loved this soap. She claims the smell is different than it was years ago. I have no idea if they changed something.</li>
    <li> Good, great gift, great scent. Excellent!</li>
    <li> Smells good in the shower and on your skin.</li>
    <li> When I grew up these were extra special to us. Scented spanish soaps. This last Christmas I got them for my senior aunts. Scent is a powerful memory device.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care about the negative reviews here who tells it&#x27;s not the same smell anymore, I purchased it from Amazon, I didn&#x27;t imagine it will be THAT different, it is a totally new scent, not the nostalgic aromatic one from old days at all. Will definitely not buy it again from here and I will advice you to do the same. Save your money.</li>
    <li> Always love Maja! For those of us whose skin is sensitive to &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34;, Maja is wonderful! Olive oil and whatever the ph is, are great. Just wish the manufacturer would leave the scent alone. Spcent suffered in transition from Spanish to Mexican manufacturing.</li>
    <li> My mom&#x27;s favorite soap. After she passed away, I took her remaining  bar of soap and have used Maja soap forever.&lt;br /&gt;Heavenly fragrance!</li>
    <li> This is the only place where I can find this soup. My older sister loves it so she had me order 2 boxes. Great product!</li>
    <li> I love this soap- it smells fantastic and the scent lingers. It is no longer available in my area. I would prefer to support my local source, but have been relegated to on-line purchase</li>
    <li> Good soap for dry skin my husband Dominick uses it exclusively .</li>
    <li> this soap was given to me as a birthday present when I was nine! Sixty years ago!&lt;br /&gt;Memories are wonderful!</li>
    <li> I have used this soap for many years.  To find it on the internet was great.  It&#x27;s the same as I remembered, and the friends I have shared it with just love it too.!</li>
    <li> I have  used this Maja Soap for over 30 years.  I questioned the seller as it was advertised as Maja by Myrurgia even though the packing did not indicate it being authentic.  He replied it was authentic Maja Soap.  This soap does not have the same scent, not even close!!  Sadly, I now have many cakes of soaps which appear to be fake copies !!</li>
    <li> This has become my favorite soap.  The scent is long lasting on the skin and the bars last through many showers.  I leave the unopened ones in clothing drawers to scent my clothing.  Makes a wonderful gift as they are so nicely wrapped.</li>
    <li> I have loved this soap from childhood, and only thought it was available in Mexico (I grew up in San Diego).  So nice to have an old favorite available!</li>
    <li> My father brought me a couple of bars of this soap from Europe a long time ago, still using it.</li>
    <li> I grew up using this soap as it was my Grandmother&#x27;s favorite and that was her usual Christmas gift for her many grandchildren.  I was thrilled to find that I could get it through Amazon and that it was as good as I remembered.  It brought back many good memories. Thank you for making this soap available.</li>
    <li> Satisfactory arrived in time in good condition</li>
    <li> The product that arrived was not as shown in the photo, different box, square soap that was not the original scent- very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have a wonderful Mother who is 93 years young and has one and only one &#x27;vice&#x27; in this world.&lt;br /&gt;She MUST have her Maja! Maja soap + dusting powder and that is that!&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recall a time when this was not so. I will always connote(make the mental connection)&lt;br /&gt;the wonderful aroma of Maja with the vision of my freshly bathed Mother being liberally dusted with Maja powder, after being happily bathed with her large round Maja soap!&lt;br /&gt;This is the only product good enough for &#x27;my&#x27; Mother. Nothing else even comes close!!&lt;br /&gt;Amazon, thank you for being the best procurer and supplier of the world&#x27;s very best products.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister. She loves it !!</li>
    <li> Well, all my girls do, anyway.  Has become a traditional Christmas gift for all of them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed on it. those aren&#x27;t the one I had before. some one need to have QUALITY control, otherwise no one will buy again. Mexico is far from Spain may be that&#x27;s why the soap such bad Quqlity. -hard. no sub . the small so bad you have to hold the breath ...</li>
    <li> ordered this for my mom, she lived in spain for 4 yrs when my dad was staioned there in the navy many yrs ago, and she loved this soap.  it is not easy to find. and if you order directly from the manufacture it is almost double the cost,  was shipped in 2 days and my mom loves it.</li>
    <li> these soaps are very difficult to find and again, are one of the best Spanish products from Spain..... very traditional and the best!!!!</li>
    <li> What can I say?  This is a beautiful, classic scent.  Love it!  Nice, mellow, floral/spicy scent.  Price is right!  Will order it again.</li>
    <li> personal secret...personal fragrance</li>
    <li> Love it, The scent  is as i expected.</li>
    <li> Maya has a lovely smell, but the consistency seems to dry my skin.I do not plan to buy any more .</li>
    <li> perfect -don&#x27;t need to go to Spain!</li>
    <li> Ordered this twice, and each time the package was damaged, and the soaps were lacking in smell</li>
    <li> Fantastic service as usual, arrived on time. The product was packaged with great care. This is same soap my wife&#x27;s mother use to use, brings back a lot of memories.</li>
    <li> This is an outstanding in several ways: Feels good; Does a great job; Pleasant aroma; and no need for Shampoo. This is from a man who uses this ladies product because it&#x27;s the best I have used..Anything else I could say would be unnecessary.</li>
    <li> I have always loved the smell of this soap. There&#x27;s nothing like it!</li>
    <li> I use to buy this years ago and I loved it!  I found this item on Amazon.com and decide to purchase again.  However, the scent is so strong, it is over-powering.  I suffer from migraines and smells are one of my triggers.  This could, very easily, trigger a migraine.  I don&#x27;t remember the soap smelling so strong before. I&#x27;m afraid I will have to throw it out.  Thankfully, I didn&#x27;t pay shipping &amp; handling.</li>
    <li> Fell in love with this soap many years ago, but it disappeared from the marketplace. Was delighted to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  It has the most wonderful smell.</li>
    <li> Ordered as I can no longer find it locally, so online shopping was my only option.  Glad to have found an outlet.</li>
    <li> I love Maja soap.  I use it all over my home in place of potpourri, or air fresheners.  I often find when I buy it online, although it is less expensive, it also doesn&#x27;t have much scent to it.  I figured Sellers are sending out their older stock to online customers...One Amazon reviewer said not all Maja is made in Spain.  She recommended buying the round 4.9 ounce versions, saying those are made in Spain and have the most long-lasting scent.  I took her advice and bought these, but was very disappointed upon opening them.  Yes, they do smell like Maja, but very weakly.  When I looked at the labels it said made in Spain AND it also said Hecho en Mexico/made in Mexico.  These will go back to Amazon as a return.  Wish Amazon would clearly state which Maja is made in Spain....</li>
    <li> I first discovered this fragrance in the late 60&#x27;s on a cruise to the Caribbean. Maja always will me my most favorite of all fragrences for a soap.</li>
    <li> Always love thee smell of this.</li>
    <li> Love this soap.  I find it to be worth the cost.  I like the fragrance very much and don&#x27;t feel i have to wear any other fragrance when I shower with this soap.  It is subtle, but woodsy with a little note of spice.</li>
    <li> Excellent smell since 1950. One of the few products that has not been changed by the manufacturers to something &amp;#34;new and improved,&amp;#34; only to destroy the great original product. Remember the new Coke? Well, Maja de Myrurgia -- thank God -- has not fallen into that rut. Unfortunately, too many of the French parfumieres have fallen for &amp;#34;change no matter what&amp;#34; and have destroyed their fragrances, perfumes, soaps etc. The best example is Guy Laroche for Men: the best DRAKKAR was the Drakkar ORIGINAL. All the other &amp;#34;Drakkars&amp;#34; they have created made me nauseous: Drakkar Noir, Drakkar Dinamyk, Drakkar Essence, etc. They are not worth 10 cents. Same with the Vintage version of Vetiver by Guerlain and the ones for sale now. There is no comparison. The vintage version is a million times better. The idiots continue their struggles in futility. Even Paco Rabanne has changed the smell of its EDT. And this is pure Lavender, the rest do not come even close.</li>
    <li> I thought the smell of the soaps were more for a man than a woman.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak to other reviews issues about the item being made in Mexico and not Spain. I&#x27;m only used to the one from Mexico and&lt;br /&gt;from my perspective there isn&#x27;t much wrong with it so I don&#x27;t care where its made. I love the fragrance, its very soothing to my skin&lt;br /&gt;and it lasts longer than regular soaps. Will buy more once these are gone.</li>
    <li> Not only is the scent wonderful &amp; unique but it brings me memories of my Mom (may she rest in peace). My Mom used this soap for yrs. Thank you.</li>
    <li> fast shipping fragrance does not last as with the liquid soap</li>
    <li> I discovered this soap in Spain and searched everywhere for it until I finally found it. It is my favorite soap because it has a little fragrance and since it has olive oil it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin.  When you bath or shower, you have a refreshing feeling and you feel so clean.  Will never use another soap. Have given it as gifts and people love it.  Highly recommend it. The bars last  a long time and I am so glad I finally found on Amazon. Try it because it isn&#x27;t just about being cleaning but a distinct fresh feeling.</li>
    <li> Timeless scent that my wife always has to have. I just love the smell of this stuff. Unlike any American soap.</li>
    <li> Disappointed ! After all the raves that I read in the reviews, and the compliments that a friend received after using the soap, I expected something a bit more pungent right out of the box. It lathers well but there is hardly any scent  - bad batch maybe? ...but certainly nothing worth using as a sachet in a drawer. I should pay more attention to the 1 &amp; 2 star reviews - many said the same thing.</li>
    <li> This soap smells wonderful, lathers wonderfully and really cleans the body without stripping away vital moisture.  The packaged is beautifully packaged and one can smell the wonderful scent through the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend...if you want a soap that really cleans and strips away body odor.</li>
    <li> Made a great gift and I love the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for someone who loves it and can&#x27;t usually find it.  She was thrilled.</li>
    <li> This product was a gift and as such makes a great gift for woman. I buy this product every year as gifts.</li>
    <li> this is a hidden treasure of cleanliness and without any residue.............&lt;br /&gt;I will use this product til the end of time...!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love it!! Great smell!!</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift and was highly appreciated due to the fact the scent brought back fond memories.</li>
    <li> Good gift for grandmothers.</li>
    <li> Glad I found it  in Amazon. Haven&amp;#34;t seen it for decades. Still smells great. Gives the lingerie drawer a nice scent.</li>
    <li> This is my all-time favorite scent ever!! I always wanted my &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; scent...well I found it!! It&#x27;s perfect for early morning and evening!  After my shower, I dust myself with the Maja powder!!</li>
    <li> Good quality, soap scent essentially the same.  Fragrance no longer as strong and lasting as when manufactured by Myrurgia in Spain.  Company acquired by Puig and now made in Mexico.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of this soap.  It reminds of an old time barbershop.  Plus it lasts a good long time.</li>
    <li> Bought the product as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was earlier than indicated, which was a pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived as expected, in proper packaging with bubble wrap for the material.&lt;br /&gt;Will be back to purchase more of it!</li>
    <li> I bought these for myself. I think I&#x27;ve mentioned that I love anything made by Maja.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite soap- originally made in Spain is now made in Mexico.</li>
    <li> NOT JUST FOR WOMEN, FINE FOR MEN TOO, UNISEX SOAP</li>
    <li> I had to return this product. The formulation has changed. The odor (not fragrance) was so strong we could not have it in the house.</li>
    <li> My grandmother kept this soap in her drawer as a sachet. I was a little girl but I&#x27;d always manager to get a bar from her for bathing so it was a wonderful surprise to see it offered here.  It has that same familiar smell of freshness and leaves you feeling refreshed after bathing. No residual feeling of soap....just soft, pleasant smelling skin.</li>
    <li> These round soaps are made in Mexico so they are the same in essence but a slight bit different in scent than the originals from Spain. If it matters to you, the soaps pictured, with the Maja dancing lady, are not the same that I received (no dancing lady sticker).&lt;br /&gt;I went to a CVS Pharmacy and these soaps are available in rectangular shape at less cost per ounce and are also made in Mexico.  They have the same packaging as the Amazon-sold product.  Even with tax, they cost less at CVS, which also carries the various powders and bath gel made by Maja, at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> In the 1960s, as an USAF pilot I would frequently be assigned to Spain in a temporary duty status.  Upon my return I would bring home bars of the Maja soap for my wife and little girls.  They would use some of the bars and store others with their clothes because of the sweet smell.  After 40 years and many  moves, only one bar remained which was recently found in my deceased wife&#x27;s dresser.  One soap and two middle aged women created a problem. Therefore; I kept the one bar and gave my girls each a set of 3 Maja soaps for Christmas.  A great gift.</li>
