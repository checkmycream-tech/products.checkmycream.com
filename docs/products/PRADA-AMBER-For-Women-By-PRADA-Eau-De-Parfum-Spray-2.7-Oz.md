      <li>I have bought this fragrance before at Dillard&#x27;s- a much better value and everything about it is the exact same.</li>
      <li>This fragrance is most definitely not for everyone.</li>
      <li>Very well worth the price, in my book.</li>
      <li>Prada has been one of my favorite perfumes for the last couple of years...</li>
      <li>I received a sample of this product and instantly fell in love with the scent.</li>
      <li>It is hard to find on a local basis and this site provided the best price and shipping deal that I could find anywhere.</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of patchouli, and deep, earthy scents, and this fits that bill for me just beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>recommend the seller and will buy from them again, if its a reasonable price..</li>

      <li>I don&#x27;t think I could live without it.  </li>
      <li>Because I live in Portugal, I thought I would have no problem finding it here in Europe</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>This was my first Amazon purchase but indeed will not be my last.</li>
      <li>It also came with an atomizer, which was an unexpected surprise.</li>
      <li>I was exactly the same as when I bought it at Nordstrom, only cheaper.</li>
      <li>but I think it was watered down because the smell didn&#x27;t longer as much as the one I purchased in the department store.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My absolute favorite fragrance. Price was good at amazon. Bought it in the train station for about twenty dollars more. Always get compliments on this one.</li>
    <li> I will wear nothing else.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance, it has a light smell, never overwhelms anybody, I get compliments on this fragrance every day.</li>
    <li> Prada has been one of my favorite perfumes for the last couple of years...at department stores this bottle is very expensive but buying it on Amazon I was able to purchase two bottles for the price of one.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Counterfit. Chemical mess. That is all.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product and instantly fell in love with the scent. Because I live in Portugal, I thought I would have no problem finding it here in Europe, Wrong! I purchased it while vacationing in California this Spring. A truly great scent for those who are sensitive to strong fragrances.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the sweet flirty scents, I became a woman, I like to smell like a woman in charge of her destiny.     Bergamot Oil Italian, Orange Oil, Bitter Orange Oil, Mandarin Flower, Mimosa India, Rose Absolute ABS, Schinus Molle ABS LMR, Peru Balsam, Patchouli Oil LMR, Raspberry Flower, Labdanum Resinoide LMR, Tonka Bean ABS LMR, Vanilla Absolute, Musk, Sandalwood Oil.    It sounds like an overload to the senses, but it&#x27;s distinguished without being a blast to your olfactory system.  The Patchouli is light and understated.  This can be dressed up or down.  And don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m still mad about Chanel, but there are some places Chanel can&#x27;t go, so for everywhere else, there&#x27;s Prada by Prada.</li>
    <li> So excited to find this price! This is the real thing, no gimmick. Why pay almost double at the department store?</li>
    <li> Although I love fine fragrances, and have tried many, Prada Amber remains my signature scent.  The wonderfully warm amber scent draws more compliments than anything I&#x27;ve ever worn.  Like Prada&#x27;s fashions, I would characterize Amber as exquisitely tasteful, classic, memorable and graceful -- if serenity has a fragrance, this may be just that scent.</li>
    <li> My wife and I love this perfume.  She has used it for years and referred many to it who ask her about how good she smells.</li>
    <li> I always get compliments on this parfum!</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume. It also came with an atomizer, which was an unexpected surprise.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend wears this and it drives me wild... :)</li>
    <li> I have bought this fragrance before at Dillard&#x27;s- a much better value and everything about it is the exact same.</li>
    <li> This is a great buy for me because I love Prada by Prada for Women.  I had to return an item a few months ago to Amazon and \\&quot;wow\\&quot; I was amazed at how fast, friendly and easy it was.  My credit was issued almost immediately.  What a great store.</li>
    <li> a little strong maybe but a clean sexy scent good for going out on the town.  Two sprays is overkill</li>
    <li> This fragrance is most definitely not for everyone. If you prefer light, floral, citrus, or sweet fragrances, I would highly recommend that you try a sample of this before you think of investing in an bottle of Prada.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I absolutely love this fragrance (and the matching body lotion)! I am a huge fan of patchouli, and deep, earthy scents, and this fits that bill for me just beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to describe it, I would say that it is a very rich, earthy, and strong fragrance. On me, one spray goes a long way, and it lasts so long that I can even smell it on my clothes for a day or two after wearing it. Very well worth the price, in my book.</li>
    <li> I simply LOVE this Prada Amber.  I don&#x27;t think I could live without it.  I have had compliments almost every day that I wear it.  Makes me feel good.</li>
    <li> I searched around to duplicate this size, shape of perfume I received as a gift two years ago.  This was exactly what I wanted and it was delivered on time and in perfect shape!</li>
    <li> I always use this scent.  No saving for good for me. I love it.</li>
    <li> I received my Prada purchase within the designated time frame and found the order was in tact and met my expectations. This was my first Amazon purchase but indeed will not be my last. Last but not least the price point was fantastic!!!!!</li>
    <li> it did not smell the same as what i have bought in department stores, Will not order this product again</li>
    <li> Got an extra little bonus gift in there&lt;br /&gt;Will only buy from this site from now on&lt;br /&gt;You should to</li>
    <li> It is hard to find on a local basis and this site provided the best price and shipping deal that I could find anywhere. Excellent product! My wife rarely uses another fragrance.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance ! Lots of complements !</li>
    <li> A great deal. Prada is usually very expensive. I was exactly the same as when I bought it at Nordstrom, only cheaper.</li>
    <li> Love love love this smell</li>
    <li> Package arrived on time and was in good condition.  This is my all time favorite perfume.  I used to only wear it when going to special places. I would wear different versions of Musk at the store or Faraway from Avon...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to treat myself and just wear this, because this is my favorite and god it makes me happy wearing it...its the best....I do not like the purple or blue version and not the newer versions as well.  This is the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the seller and will buy from them again, if its a reasonable price..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a woman who is into the flowery, fruity, powdery smells, and I tend to love strong smells woody, nature kinds. This fragrance is very unique and allows me to smell great without smelling sweet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years!</li>
    <li> I enjoy this perfume because of it&#x27;s nice, light scent. It is by for my new favorite scent. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I received a bottle of this last week. I was so excited. There&#x27;s no way that this is authentic eau de parfum. Even with it still wet on my skin, it has ZERO scent. AND - even better - it&#x27;s non-returnable. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!</li>
    <li> Wow! Great price for a very expensive and great perfume</li>
    <li> Good price but I think it was watered down because the smell didn&#x27;t longer as much as the one I purchased in the department store.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my favorite fragrance now, and I get compliments on it all day long - it lasts, without being overwhelming. It&#x27;s spicy and unique.</li>
    <li> The price seemed too good to be true.  My wife has had a couple bottles of this perfume, from department stores.  It has an exotic strong scent.  As good as we can tell, this perfume is the same as we have bought in department stores.  Good deal.</li>
    <li> I have been using Prada perfume for a few years.  I always buy it from the big department stores.  I discovered that I could purchase it from Amazon.  I also discovered I could buy a 2.7 oz at an even better cost.  This product came on time and the service was wonderful.</li>
    <li> This product is THE best Prada I have ever ordered...it was delivered well before expected and smells 100% like I just brought it home from the department store..  I will buy again and again from this seller!!! I couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
    <li> Love it and stay on all day</li>
    <li> I could not believe how fast I got my merchandise.  I love this product and will definitely be a return customer.  I am a very very very pleased customer!!!</li>
    <li> This has good a great scent to it.  Everyone also compliments me when I&#x27;m wearing it and I feel confident.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume. Whenever i wear it, someone invariably will ask me &amp;#34;what smells so good?&amp;#34; Hubby loves it,too! My very favorite</li>
    <li> neither here nor there</li>
