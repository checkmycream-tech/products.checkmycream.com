    <li> I dont paeticularly have sensitive skin but just started getting into soap and brush shaving.  It does make my skin feel a little better after shaving and makes me feel clean and fresh</li>
    <li> i pay $8.43 for this? i had to hand it to them...no alcohol...but you don&#x27;t feel fresh...smell is okay....not on plastic container...you cannot just squeeze ...gravity does the work on this one which is a hassle...they sell this at walmart...$5.54 talk about getting jack...</li>
    <li> This will not sting your skin, is very neutral (cologne will sit on top very well), and will make your skin feel excellently smooth.</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price. I bought this for my husband&#x27;s birthday and he really likes it, it is very soothing for sensetive skin with a very gentle smell. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Soothing and refreshing with a mild and pleasant smell.  Great price, easy to apply, widely available.  Really like it.</li>
    <li> Good aftershave.  Soothes skin irritation and moisturizes the face well.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Very good. Leaves skin feeling moisturized and soft.</li>
    <li> Great Product, leaves a clean smooth look on skin.</li>
    <li> This with my safety razor and I can&#x27;t imagine life without it. The smell is very pleasant, there&#x27;s no burn, goes on really nicely without feeling greasy, and it washes off the hands without even using soap. They sell it everywhere, Walmart Target etc. Definitely pick up a bottle if you also like double-edge razors, it&#x27;ll make your morning 10x awesomer.</li>
    <li> Now truth be told... I knew this was unscented and I still choose to give it a try. It works great, does what it is supposed to do. BUT... the unscent reminds me of paste from grade school. I am mixing it with a Niva Aqua aftershave balm to get what I paid for but I will not be buying this again. Not Niva&#x27;s fault or Amazon&#x27;s... My choice.</li>
    <li> I will never use a different post shave balm. This is the best stuff you can get, period.</li>
    <li> This is a good product at a reasonable price. I can&#x27;t find anything like it locally so I appreciate being able to get it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Pros: Like the charming fragrance.it does the work.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: expensive</li>
    <li> This is another well known aftershave balm that feels great.  It does not have much scent but who cares for the price.  The most important things it you face will feel good and it will take away any feeling of razor rawness or burn.  Get it you will love it!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best after shave I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, works very well.</li>
    <li> After a straight razor shave, this stuff is like the gravy on the biscuits. Such a refreshing feel. The key is to wash your face with cold water after the shave, then apply this beauty. You will feel your face orgasm, then it will thank you. Shaving has never been so rewarding.</li>
    <li> This after shave balm will definitely rehydrate and sooth the skin after a shave.  There is a faint scent to this product that is pleasant and fades quickly.  The consistency is rather watery and easy to apply gently to the skin without having to rub it in.  While almost all men who get into wet shaving believe themselves to have sensitive skin, whether or not this is actually the case it is just as important to try out different products for your pre and post shave if you suffer from razor burn or irritation after shaving as it is to evaluate/practice your technique.  Though this after shave balm alone will not reduce irritation or razor burn, in tandem with other products (prorasso sensitive skin preshave balm and alum block) it has helped to reduce this issue and has definitely enhanced the wet shaving experience for me.</li>
    <li> I have truly sensitive skin ... especially to scents and chemicals.  This immediately started to irritate my face.  Burning, redness etc. I did not expect this from a product made for sensitive skin.  I use the Nivea sensitive skin shave cream in a tube and Nivea gel in a can, and Williams shave soap with no issues. But my reaction to this was immediate the two times I applied it to my face.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Fast shipping</li>
