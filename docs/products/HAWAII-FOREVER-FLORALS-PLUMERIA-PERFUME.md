      <li>I love the light smell of Plumeria.  </li>
      <li>Other wonderful fragrances are available which I&#x27;ve tried and liked.[[ASIN:</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve looked everywhere for a product that captured the beautiful essence of plumeria, I should have known it could only come from Hawaii.</li>
      <li>what a fabulous place....</li>
      <li>It still smelt like cheap perfume but that&#x27;s what you get with the price</li>
      <li>Fast shipment and wonderful personal note included!</li>
      <li>works great as a air freshener or bathroom deoderizer instant no bad smell.</li>
      <li>Special Aloha\\&quot; for daytime.</li>

      <li>There was a personal, handwritten note from the sales person that made the buy even more special and unique.</li>
      <li>Perfume smells exactly as i expected, arrived in good condition.</li>
      <li>, right?</li>

      <li>My husband likes it very much.</li>
      <li>I am extremely pleased with this purchase, especially for the price!!&lt;br /&gt;It can be used as a perfume, car deodorizer, etc etc...</li>

      <li>would like it to be more floral less alcohol but</li>
      <li>and it was a little strong at first</li>
      <li>This smells exactly like the blossoms and brings back fond memories every time I wear it.</li>
      <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it can be a little strong at first but that fades quickly and you just need to apply a little.</li>
      <li>but it wasn&#x27;t the natural smell I was going for.</li>
      <li>It is VERY STRONG so you only need a little tiny drop on your wrists or neck etc.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I received this package yesterday and got lovely personal small note written by seller from Hawaii.</li>
      <li>Very fresh and clean smelling Plumeria fragrance is subtle yet long lasting.</li>
      <li>I was lucky enough to visit Maui a few years back and outside of my house was a plumeria tree.</li>

    <li> I love the smell of this perfume.  I first purchased this on my 40 wedding anniversary on our trip to Hawaii.  Looked all over for it in the stores here in Florida.  Could never find it.  Thanks</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent. I found it in Hawaii 58 years ago, on the lovely Plumeria  leis</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to visit Maui a few years back and outside of my house was a plumeria tree. Everyday I would stop to smell it and at night for 10 days I picked one plumeria and put it on my pillow when I went to sleep. I have looked and tried so many different fragrances to find something that smelled like that beautiful flower that put me to sleep every night.&lt;br /&gt;This product has it! It is VERY STRONG so you only need a little tiny drop on your wrists or neck etc.&lt;br /&gt;The seller even wrote me a personalized hand written thank you in beautiful handwriting.

    <li> Plumeria is hands down my favorite scent ever. This company does a great job. It smells very natural- not chemical or fake. It&#x27;s.subtle but lovely.</li>
    <li> Perfume smells exactly as i expected, arrived in good condition. good product.</li>
    <li> Mom loved the fragrance.  It was a gift for her 90th birthday.  She loves Hawaii and was sorry she did not buy a bottle of this cologne when she went to Hawaii 25 years ago.  This was a great reminder of her memories there.</li>
    <li> Forever florals have the best, most authenic smells. i miss living in hawaii and the smell of plumeria in the wind. this brought me back... yum! amazing the care that was taken in packaging. there was even a handwritten note!</li>
    <li> Smelt pretty but it wasn&#x27;t the natural smell I was going for. It still smelt like cheap perfume but that&#x27;s what you get with the price, right? It is nice if you can handle artificial perfume but I was looking for a more pure natural oil perfume.</li>
    <li> I am assuming that I will like it. I did whenever I was in Hawaii. Since you do not ship to Canada, I have to have it sent to my son in Alaska and then he mails it to me at a later date. So I do not have it yet. I am sure I will like it. No problem.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, the roll on is perfect for traveling and it smells like fresh flowers.  I have had friends ask me what Perfume I am wearing because it smelled so sweet and subtle.</li>
    <li> When I visited Aruba several years ago I noticed that the air seemed to smell like bubble gum.  I realized that it was the plumeria trees and have loved the fragrance ever since. This smells exactly like the blossoms and brings back fond memories every time I wear it.</li>
    <li> This is such a wonderful perfume!  I&#x27;ve gotten lots of nice compliments on it.</li>
    <li> I will order this again and use it all summer.......I would love to return to HAWAII....what a fabulous place....I am happy to have the smell of Hawaii now I need the music and the plants...haha</li>
    <li> Wonderful. Took me back to Hawaii!</li>
    <li> To chemically smelling</li>
    <li> This scent makes me homesick. I will buy it again and recommend it to people. I love this island smell and my friends love it on me!</li>
    <li> I ordered the Pikaki and Plumeria roll on&#x27;s and the scent is so authentic and my order came very prompt.  I will always recommend this business and these products!  The very best!  Mahalo!  Cathy</li>
    <li> I love the light smell of Plumeria.  This perfume is not over powering and is just what I wanted in the product.</li>
    <li> My husband is from hawaii and his favorite sent in plumeria. I ordered this and it was a little strong at first but it faded to a pleasant smell quickly. My husband likes it very much.</li>
    <li> Years ago when a friend came back after vacationing in Hawaii she brought me a sample of this fragrance.  I instantly fell in love with this heavenly scent. Unfortunately, at that time, I couldn&#x27;t order it through the mail.  Since the perfume is a stronger scent I&#x27;ll save it for the evening so I&#x27;ve gone ahead and ordered the cologne from \\&quot;A Special Aloha\\&quot; for daytime.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve looked everywhere for a product that captured the beautiful essence of plumeria, I should have known it could only come from Hawaii. I love the smell of this perfume and it lasts!</li>
    <li> Scent doesn&#x27;t last long but it&#x27;s nice anyway :)</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, bought it on Maui and cant be without it now!! Reminds my husband and I of how the air smelled while we were there. Beautiful and fragrant!! Thank you. Fast shipment and wonderful personal note included!</li>
