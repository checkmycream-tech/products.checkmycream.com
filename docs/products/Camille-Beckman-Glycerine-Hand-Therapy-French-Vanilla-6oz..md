      <li>It will leave your skin smooth and fresh all day.   </li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>

      <li>I noticed a difference the first time I used it.  </li>
      <li>The French Vanilla Hand therapy has been my wife&#x27;s favorite hand lotion for years.</li>
      <li>It does a great job on dry skin and especially the cuticles.  </li>
      <li>As a hand cream, it does absorb pretty well without much of a residue.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the French Vanilla, the rosewater, the Camille, and the lavender--amongst other scents that I can&#x27;t currently remember--and every one of them smelled wonderful.  </li>
      <li>Everyone always wants to borrow this when I put it on.</li>
      <li>It is incredibly reasonable, and won&#x27;t take a bite out of your budget.</li>

      <li>/&gt;Vanilla fragrance is nice but not overwhelming</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>round and more often in winter because it really helps keep hands soft and prevents chapping and cracking.  </li>
      <li>This is one of the those rare products that is about as close to perfection as anything can possibly get.  </li>
      <li>This cream is quickly absorbed and dries so that you can put your rings back on without them swinging around.  </li>
      <li>I have tried more lotions and creams than I can possibly name and this is the one and only cream that actually works.  </li>
      <li>More importantly, after smoothing it over your hands, it&#x27;s not greasy and doesn&#x27;t glisten for a long period of time like a hand cream I purchased from Victoria Secret.  </li>
      <li>I love that it isn&#x27;t greasy, and I can actually see the difference in my hands when used a few times a week.</li>
      <li>I hesitated due to the cost but after reading some of the reviews decided it was worth trying.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth its price and the trouble to find it.</li>
      <li>It not only keeps the dryness at bay and heals the cracks when I do get them, it actually makes my hands soft.    </li>
      <li>Keeps hands soft for a long time.</li>
      <li>This lotion makes your hands so soft and smooth, and the french vanilla smell is very subtle and not overpowering.</li>
      <li>While the scent was a bit too strong for me, the cream itself is thick, moisturizing and something that has finally worked on my dry skin.  </li>

<li> It was a sentimental gift.</li>
<li> They not only get rough, they will get so bad that they crack and bleed.  </li>
<li> Hard to find in stores, so I searched and found online</li>
<li> Needless to say, looking for a new hand cream after all that time was depressing,</li>
<li> Every winter, I dread the painful, cracked, bleeding hands that accompany the cold temperatures.</li>

    <li> The French Vanilla Hand therapy has been my wife&#x27;s favorite hand lotion for years.</li>
    <li> I have been using Camille Beckman for years and I love it.  The French Vanilla is one of my favorites.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This lotion makes your hands so soft and smooth, and the french vanilla smell is very subtle and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I have happily used this Camille Beckman product for seven years. This is one of the most appealling vanilla products you will find. Its scent is neither sickening sweet, nor is it a bland scent that fades after a few hours. It smells quite yummy, and has the pleasant aroma of walking into an exquisite bakery filled with delicacies.   I use this as a body moisturizer, even though it is listed as a hand therapy. It will leave your skin smooth and fresh all day.   Oh, and I haven&#x27;t mentioned the price. It is incredibly reasonable, and won&#x27;t take a bite out of your budget. If you want a vanilla scented moisturizer, you will love this product.</li>
    <li> Every winter, I dread the painful, cracked, bleeding hands that accompany the cold temperatures. This winter has been the coldest in years, but my hands have held up better than ever. I started using this hand lotion in November and find it not only preventive, but also healing. It doesn&#x27;t seem heavy to me, I use it day and night. It has a nice scent that is not overpowering. I was relieved to find that it did not cause the \\&quot;perfumy headache\\&quot; I often get from scented products.</li>
    <li> This is the best hand cream I have found. It has a light fragrance and often people will ask what it is because it smells so good. I use it year round and more often in winter because it really helps keep hands soft and prevents chapping and cracking.  It also makes a great gift because the aroma isn&#x27;t overwhelming.  I always order several tubes because it isn&#x27;t available where I live!</li>
    <li> I use it just before I go to bed to allow it to soak in all night.  The other scents in this product line are a bit too strong for me but the French Vanilla is fine.</li>
    <li> This hand lotion is fantastic.  It does a great job on dry skin and especially the cuticles.  A little goes a long way so it is well worth the money here.  I hesitated due to the cost but after reading some of the reviews decided it was worth trying.  So glad I did.  This stuff is amazing.  Put it on at night especially to relieve dryness.  It absobs nicely and is not greasy, just makes your skin feel nice and soft.  I noticed a difference the first time I used it.  Will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.  I have used the hand cream for several years now and it&#x27;s   the only product that protects my hands and feet from dryness.  I received this product promptly and in good condition.</li>
    <li> Smells Great. Feels Great. Best smelling hand lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. Hard to find in stores, so I searched and found online (Amazon has everything!). Everyone always wants to borrow this when I put it on.</li>
    <li> While the scent was a bit too strong for me, the cream itself is thick, moisturizing and something that has finally worked on my dry skin.  I use it on my hands but also on my shins and feet.  I am in love with Camile Beckman glycerine hand creams.  If you have dry skin and want a thicker lotion that isn&#x27;t greasy, this is it for you!</li>
    <li> I have been using this hand cream for 15 years and won&#x27;t use anything else. It heals and conditions my hands wonderfully. I use it twice a day, morning and evening and it lasts all the hours in between.</li>
    <li> One of the best hand creams I have ever tried.  A little expensive, but well worth the money.</li>

The scent is not overpowering either. I have paid a lot more for a jar of hand lotion, but I have never had these results. I have a smaller size tube in my purse at all times, too. This makes a great gift, and I have converted a lot of new customers for this product. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It is an excellent product and I would highly recommend it to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for twenty plus years.&lt;br /&gt;Sharon Barrea</li>
    <li> Greatest lotion I have found.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine purchased this hand cream for me several years ago from a hospital gift shop.  The smell is second to none when you think of French Vanilla.  The smell and richness of the cream is incredibly appealing. More importantly, after smoothing it over your hands, it&#x27;s not greasy and doesn&#x27;t glisten for a long period of time like a hand cream I purchased from Victoria Secret.  This cream is quickly absorbed and dries so that you can put your rings back on without them swinging around.  It does a wonderful job of moisturizing and softening your hands.  I&#x27;m so glad I was able to find this product again in Amazon.</li>
    <li> I used Pacquins hand cream for more than 50 years before it was discontinued.  Needless to say, looking for a new hand cream after all that time was depressing, but I found this quite by accident and have been very pleased with it.  Nothing will ever feel as good to my skin as Pacquins did, but I&#x27;m more than grateful that I found this product because it comes as close as possible without being Pacquins!!</li>

    <li> Love this stuff. Been using it for years. Only hand created that works.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I got  sample from birchbox and I absolutely love this stuff. The  smell alone is awesome. I recommend this for dry hands and for anyone who loves lotion. It leaves your hands feeling nice and moisturized. None of that greasy feeling like most other hand lotions.</li>
    <li> See above statement on cream use.  This tube is more portable for my husband.  He keeps a tube in his truck and another one in the car.</li>
    <li> Love this product&lt;br /&gt;Not greasy,&lt;br /&gt;Vanilla fragrance is nice but not overwhelming&lt;br /&gt;Convenient product container&lt;br /&gt;Would buy this product again</li>
    <li> Excellent hand lotion! Keeps hands soft for a long time. Not greasy at all.  Love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years. It is the BEST vanilla scent ever!!!!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t receive French Vanilla which was disappointing since it was a gift for somrone whose mother always used French Vanilla. It was a sentimental gift. I received Vanilla Noel which made me feel it was a leftover from what didn&#x27;t sell at Christmas.</li>
