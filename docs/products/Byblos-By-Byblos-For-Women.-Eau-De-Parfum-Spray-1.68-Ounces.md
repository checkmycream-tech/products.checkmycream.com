      <li>Glad it&#x27;s still around.. .beautiful!</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this fragance!</li>
      <li>This was sold at Sears many years ago, and a Doctor&#x27;s wife told me about it.</li>
      <li>Byblos is my favorite perfume.</li>
      <li>I love the smell.  </li>
      <li>Byblos is just okay.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love this perfume.</li>
      <li>what I like the most about it is that it&#x27;s not a \\&quot;known\\&quot; scent.  </li>
      <li>This one does not cause me any breathing problems, and I love the fragrance.</li>
      <li>but I love the smell</li>
      <li>Wonderfully mystical Italian scent, created by Illias.</li>
      <li>My favorite all time fragrance.</li>
      <li>Byblos is pleasant enough &amp; lasts a good at 6-8 hours.</li>
      <li>I lean towards watery, citrus, clean scents more than flowery ones.  </li>
      <li>A nice size bottle with an amazing low price.</li>
      <li>Sometimes I order for the bottle and am always so happy because not only do I like the bottle</li>
      <li>Plus, it can be had for cheap.</li>
      <li>It claims more and more women, each day, though they&#x27;ve cancelled this 2nd release... and just when others are beginning to dive into it&#x27;s wonders.</li>
      <li>The package came quickly.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an old favorite of mine from about 20  years ago.  </li>
      <li>I was given my first bottle by my daughter in the early 90s, and I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really think there&#x27;s anything terribly special about this scent.</li>
      <li>It is unique and those who love it&#x27;s subtle yet sexy vibe it gives off, are devoted.</li>
      <li>The bottle is so pretty.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, Byblos is pretty but lackluster.</li>
      <li>Crisp fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I am hyper-sensitive to most chemicals, especially the solvents used in almost all of the fragrances these days.</li>
      <li>The floral of violets, mimosa, heliotrope and others, the kick of pepper and the woods of cedar, are just the start when the first burst of raspberries wafts into your senses.</li>
      <li>But where are all those pretty basenotes?</li>
      <li>In keeping with the style of perfumes like Sunflowers, although Sunflowers is a better composition imo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blue bottle is cobalt, much darker than pictured ... and shorter and fatter.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Byblos wears as a just slightly sweet, soft floral.</li>
      <li>There are just so many other things to wear in this class at this price.</li>
      <li>I love the slightly grapefruity smell.</li>
      <li>The brown plastic top is tacky and does not fit the neck of the bottle well.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite fragrance and it is so hard to find.  </li>
      <li>-- that&#x27;s something that strikes me about many of the fragrances from the late 1980s or early 1990s, like it was created hastily as an anti-Poison or an anti-Red.</li>
      <li>My skin interacts negatively with most perfumes and only two really are compatible with my chemistry make up-Joy and Byblos.</li>
      <li>If all those who love this fragrance could email &amp;#34;House of Byblos&amp;#34; and plead for its &amp;#34;keeping&amp;#34;, others can experience it before it&#x27;s too late.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Byblos is my favorite perfume. My skin interacts negatively with most perfumes and only two really are compatible with my chemistry make up-Joy and Byblos. I love the slightly grapefruity smell. I always get compliments when I wear it and people constantly ask me about it. I&#x27;d give it ten stars if I could!</li>
    <li> Byblos is pleasant enough &amp; lasts a good at 6-8 hours. Plus, it can be had for cheap. However, I doubt I will be replacing this bottle unless it improves on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Byblos wears as a just slightly sweet, soft floral. But where are all those pretty basenotes? I don&#x27;t get them on me. Byblos seems thin, like it is missing some depth &amp; lacking well-roundedness -- that&#x27;s something that strikes me about many of the fragrances from the late 1980s or early 1990s, like it was created hastily as an anti-Poison or an anti-Red. In keeping with the style of perfumes like Sunflowers, although Sunflowers is a better composition imo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blue bottle is cobalt, much darker than pictured ... and shorter and fatter. I have the 1.7 oz EDP. The brown plastic top is tacky and does not fit the neck of the bottle well. Even the box, including the interior padding, is lacking. The presentation just doesn&#x27;t suggest quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Byblos is pretty but lackluster. There are just so many other things to wear in this class at this price. I think we should leave Byblos back in the 1990s where it belongs.</li>
    <li> My favorite all time fragrance. Not carried in stores</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful. This fragrance can be hard to find, and I&#x27;ve been wearing it on-and-off for 20 years. Love it!</li>
    <li> Great smell.  The bottle is so pretty.  I love buying perfume bottles but the perfume has to smell great.  Sometimes I order for the bottle and am always so happy because not only do I like the bottle but I love the smell</li>
    <li> Wonderfully mystical Italian scent, created by Illias. And I&#x27;ve never read &amp;#34;anywhere!&amp;#34; that it was created by or for, Giorgio Armani. Not even the &amp;#34;House of Byblos&amp;#34; claims this. This is 2nd release of this fragrant marvel. If you want a list of it&#x27;s ingredients, go to Fragrantica.com. The floral of violets, mimosa, heliotrope and others, the kick of pepper and the woods of cedar, are just the start when the first burst of raspberries wafts into your senses. It is unique and those who love it&#x27;s subtle yet sexy vibe it gives off, are devoted. It claims more and more women, each day, though they&#x27;ve cancelled this 2nd release... and just when others are beginning to dive into it&#x27;s wonders. If all those who love this fragrance could email &amp;#34;House of Byblos&amp;#34; and plead for its &amp;#34;keeping&amp;#34;, others can experience it before it&#x27;s too late. Opal</li>
    <li> This is my favorite fragrance and it is so hard to find.  The package came quickly.  The price was great.  I am happy with this purchase and will order from this company again.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to Byblos years ago and could no longer find it in department stores. Glad it&#x27;s still around.. .beautiful!</li>
    <li> This is my signature scent. I was given my first bottle by my daughter in the early 90s, and I absolutely love it. I am hyper-sensitive to most chemicals, especially the solvents used in almost all of the fragrances these days. This one does not cause me any breathing problems, and I love the fragrance. The blend makes me think of musk roses.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. It&#x27;s an old favorite of mine from about 20  years ago.  Smells delicious but what I like the most about it is that it&#x27;s not a \\&quot;known\\&quot; scent.  If I walk down the street, I don&#x27;t like to smell like every other woman who is wearing the current fad of perfume.  This never dissapoints.  Winter or Summer - I love it.</li>
    <li> Byblos is just okay. It&#x27;s another fruity floral in the long line-up of fruity floral perfumes. I don&#x27;t really think there&#x27;s anything terribly special about this scent.</li>
    <li> Crisp fragrance.  Not too heavy. Quality product.</li>
    <li> My favorite parfum!!!</li>
    <li> Bought for a friend: top-note subtle,  mellow lingering fragrance. She loved it.</li>
    <li> been using this product almost 15 years. This was sold at Sears many years ago, and a Doctor&#x27;s wife told me about it.</li>
    <li> I love the smell.  I lean towards watery, citrus, clean scents more than flowery ones.  The smell is perfect for me.  However, even though this is an eau de parfum, it doesn&#x27;t have longevity on me like I would like.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this fragance! A nice size bottle with an amazing low price.</li>
