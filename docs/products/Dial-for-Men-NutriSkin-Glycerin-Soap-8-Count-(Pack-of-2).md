      <li>This product is fantastic.</li>

      <li>My wife likes it on me but mostly noticed it right after I switched from Dial Gold.</li>
      <li>You feel clean and the scent stays with you for hours.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I brought it in large quantity.</li>
      <li>Cool smell.</li>
      <li>Finally a bar soap that smells good for a man.  </li>
      <li>Seriously the best smelling mens soap I have ever used.</li>
      <li>One quick e-mail to Amazon</li>
      <li>or more specifically, New Car Smell.</li>
      <li>I bought about 10 years worth.    </li>
      <li>Dial makes this product worth buying.</li>
      <li>Unlike other soaps or male oriented bathing bars, this one has a great aroma, works well, rinses off easily and leaves you smelling fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>Great value, but still a very drying soap given the glycerin and other ingredients it boasts.</li>
      <li>just right for the man that doesn&#x27;t want to use a puffy thing</li>
      <li>Personally, I prefer a very mild, clean scent.</li>
      <li>Fair price and fast shipping despite order issue listed above, Still, I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>The soap cleans well, smells fine, and lasts longer than many other brands.</li>
      <li>Lasts well in shower and consistent through the bar</li>
      <li>Pretty sure they would reformulate if it were that big of a concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Skin feels Clean and refreshed and seems to moisturize it better than previous men&#x27;s bar soaps.</li>
      <li>As far as I know gets me clean.</li>
      <li>Nutriskin 7 Bionutrients Soap works well with soft water and generates a vibrant clean feeling.</li>
      <li>Thanks Dial, Mike</li>
      <li>I really, really like this soap.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t describe the scent very well</li>
      <li>This Dial product makes showering a real privilege.</li>
      <li>Better than I expected.</li>
      <li>It dries out faster, and doesn&#x27;t seem to use as much on my showers.</li>
      <li>Good price, smells good (very subtle masculine scent), and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
      <li>I like this soap that much.</li>
      <li>Item is as shown and arrived in good working order, minus the fact that only ONE package of 8 bars arrives.</li>
      <li>On the positive side, it only cost about 50 cents per bar, but I would rather pay more and get a soap like the Blue Grit if I can find a substitute.</li>
      <li>Makes good lather unlike other glycerin-based soaps and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin as much as lye-based soaps.  </li>
      <li>Coming from a dude who is not super picky about his soaps, I will say, this is not my favorite.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>High quality.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>At one time this was available in most retail stores, but for reasons unclear it became harder and harder to find locally but thanks to Amazon</li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is great- at least in my opinion, and yes, it does contain Aluminum Powder in it&#x27;s ingredients, as another reviewer claimed, however after worrying and researching a lot, I&#x27;ve come to peace of mind in using this soap for the long term since Aluminum use in antiperspirants and soaps (along with soda cans, food cans etc) has not had any proven link to Alzheimer&#x27;s</li>
      <li>Not a bad bar of soap if you&#x27;re not expecting anything special, but don&#x27;t get it if you suffer from dry skin or want to battle dry indoor heating in the winter</li>
      <li>I now smell like fresh clean manly soap rather than my usual man-stink.  </li>
      <li>The soap lathers up well, but I do not really feel like it makes you feel clean.</li>
      <li>It barely dries out between daily showers, and it has full air circulation (not sitting in a puddle).</li>
      <li>Be aware that this is 2 8-packs, for a total of 16 bars!  </li>
      <li>His skills is always soft and smells manly!</li>
      <li>After that, I stick the old bar to the new bar and repeat.</li>
      <li>It use to be available at Target for half the price, but I can no longer find it there.</li>
      <li>Product is equivalent to other Dial soaps as far as cleaning and odor protection but rinses clean with no residue feeling.</li>
      <li>After the first bar of Dial for Men Nutriskin 7, I am ready to throw the other bars out.</li>
      <li>Started using it when it first came out and will use it as long as I can get it.</li>
      <li>Like all bar soaps it leave more soap scum than liquids.</li>
      <li>So far no allergic reactions or breakouts.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t seem to find it in my local stores but Amazon gets it to me fast.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much easier to just stick it on the next bar.</li>
      <li>I buy everything from Amazon for my home supplies however this item is a complete rip off.</li>
      <li>On the plus side, my local men&#x27;s homeless shelter is going to smell nice and rosy for the next few months.</li>

    <li> Great value, but still a very drying soap given the glycerin and other ingredients it boasts. Not a bad bar of soap if you&#x27;re not expecting anything special, but don&#x27;t get it if you suffer from dry skin or want to battle dry indoor heating in the winter</li>
    <li> Love this soap; to bad I&#x27;m now allergic to it.</li>
    <li> Dial makes this product worth buying. It does a good job at cleaning and has a good smell. Thanks Dial, Mike</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful I gave these out as stocking stuffers to the boys in my family,  they like how it smells and feels. So far no allergic reactions or breakouts. Dial soap for men is amazing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s soap, don&#x27;t see what makes it for men</li>
    <li> Has the same affect as liquid soap body wash Same cleaning and fragrance just right for the man that doesn&#x27;t want to use a puffy thing</li>
    <li> Item is as shown and arrived in good working order, minus the fact that only ONE package of 8 bars arrives. One quick e-mail to Amazon and I was appropriately refunded immediately. The soap cleans well, smells fine, and lasts longer than many other brands. No oily feel or perfume smell. Fair price and fast shipping despite order issue listed above, Still, I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> For years I have used Dial Blue Grit for Men. This is a wonderful soap, but Dial does not make it any more. There are a few internet vendors selling it at several dollars per bar, so I know people really want that soap. However, I was forced to find another soap. I bought a pack of 8 of the Nutriskin 7 at Tar**t. After the first bar of Dial for Men Nutriskin 7, I am ready to throw the other bars out. Cosmetically, it is an unattractive charcoal gray color. There is no scent to the bar at all, which you may consider good or bad. Personally, I prefer a very mild, clean scent. The soap lathers up well, but I do not really feel like it makes you feel clean. On the positive side, it only cost about 50 cents per bar, but I would rather pay more and get a soap like the Blue Grit if I can find a substitute.</li>
    <li> Smells great and works well</li>
    <li> I was price shopping and found this stinks like perfume.  I don&#x27;t care for it at all, and how do I return a used bar of soap?  On the plus side, my local men&#x27;s homeless shelter is going to smell nice and rosy for the next few months.</li>
    <li> One of the few men&#x27;s soaps that don&#x27;t dry you out or smell too much like a used car salesman.  Just so some know, there are 16 bars of soap in this kit, so the price is well below Target, etc.</li>
    <li> my husband loved this trying to get away from antibacterial soaps</li>
    <li> I love this soap. It has a very slight man scent, not making me smell like I&#x27;ve doused myself in cologne. My wife likes it on me but mostly noticed it right after I switched from Dial Gold. I shower every day, sometimes twice. Each bar lasts about two weeks. After that, I stick the old bar to the new bar and repeat. When the bar shrinks down to very thin, it doesn&#x27;t turn into jelly like regular soap, it will just break. It&#x27;s much easier to just stick it on the next bar.</li>
    <li> Finally a bar soap that smells good for a man.  This is all I use!</li>
    <li> some speculation here regarding the actual scent of these Dial For Men Nutriskin 7 Bionutrients Soap Bars. to me, the scent is leather. or more specifically, New Car Smell. it&#x27;s a subtle fragrance, not loud like Irish Spring. i love it!</li>
    <li> Like all of Dials Nutriskin products for Men, I am not impressed with how nourished they leave my skin. I am very happy with how clean I feel after using this soap. It makes a lot of lather and seems to rinse off easily. Like all bar soaps it leave more soap scum than liquids. I prefer bar soaps because they work for me and are easier to use than liquids. I use a wash cloth to wash with and this may be a part of my reasoning for preferring them. If you use something else or nothing you might feel differently. I grew up using a wash cloth and don&#x27;t feel like just rubbing some soap on my skin does quite as good a job of cleaning. Sponges, and other things don&#x27;t seem to work well for me either. Although I do like to use a loofah like things for removing dead skin.  More information than you wanted perhaps.</li>
    <li> not bad, not wonderful, was priced right,  I do like that it rinses well other than that; it&#x27;s soap how bad could it be screwed up?</li>
    <li> These bars have aluminum in them.  We will not be purchasing these bars again.</li>
    <li> Dial men&#x27;s soap is the only soap I will use. Started using it when it first came out and will use it as long as I can get it. Very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Aroma of this soap is very good.... I feel good to take shower with that scent...my love also liked it!!!! Thumbs up...</li>
    <li> Good smell. Rinses smoothly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Dial soaps for some time now because, for some weird reason or other, Ivory would dry my skin out something fierce.  The Dial line of soaps did not do this, so I&#x27;ve been using them for quite some time now.  It was my younger daughter who introduced me to the Dial Soap for Men.  She had bought some by accident.  (She hadn&#x27;t read the label, it seems). I tried it and I liked it because it has a nice, pleasant musky aroma.  Not that I object to the aroma of regular Dial, mind you, but this soap&#x27;s aroma I find rather pleasing.  Do I recommend this product?  Yes, I do, because a), it&#x27;s Dial soap and b), I happen to like the aroma.  Maybe you&#x27;ll like it, too.</li>
    <li> I buy this item repeatedly and my husband loves it!  His skills is always soft and smells manly!</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic. Better than I expected. High quality.</li>
    <li> Lasts well in shower and consistent through the bar</li>
    <li> My Husband totally loves it. I used it a couple of times when I used his shower, it is strong so I put a bar of my Dove Pink Rose in his shower, now we both are happy</li>
    <li> This is a great soap.  I love the way it smells and my son and husband like what it does for their skin.  I just wish I could find it in stores.  It use to be available at Target for half the price, but I can no longer find it there.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this soap, couldn&#x27;t find  it in any stores.  Found it online, appreciate the price and quantity it comes in.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Item works well.  Skin feels Clean and refreshed and seems to moisturize it better than previous men&#x27;s bar soaps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been swapping the last few years back and forth between regular Irish Spring and their Irish Spring Moisture Blast bar soaps because I could get large amounts at Costco. Never had issues until lately. The weather in SoCal has been really cool and dry lately so my skin has been drying more than normal and the Irish Spring regular dries me out to the point of itchy pain. The other issue was it doesn&#x27;t dry out often between uses of washing hands at the sink. It barely dries out between daily showers, and it has full air circulation (not sitting in a puddle). This Dial bar soap is WAY better. It dries out faster, and doesn&#x27;t seem to use as much on my showers. Purchased the regular 8 pack for a similar price at Target, but this is where I will be purchasing it in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is great- at least in my opinion, and yes, it does contain Aluminum Powder in it&#x27;s ingredients, as another reviewer claimed, however after worrying and researching a lot, I&#x27;ve come to peace of mind in using this soap for the long term since Aluminum use in antiperspirants and soaps (along with soda cans, food cans etc) has not had any proven link to Alzheimer&#x27;s and it is actually listed as one of the most common myths associated with it. Then again, I grew up around lead paint, and I drank from garden hoses and I&#x27;m still perfectly okay as is the rest of my family.. soooo maybe I&#x27;m a bit jaded about all this stuff. Pretty sure they would reformulate if it were that big of a concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great smell and price. Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> I like the way this soap last. I&#x27;m glad I brought it in large quantity. It keeps me from buying so often.</li>
    <li> I love this glycerin soap.</li>
    <li> Makes good lather unlike other glycerin-based soaps and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin as much as lye-based soaps.  Pleasant fragrance and useful shape to the bar......</li>
    <li> Smelly!  I now smell like fresh clean manly soap rather than my usual man-stink.  Be aware that this is 2 8-packs, for a total of 16 bars!  What a deal!</li>
    <li> I love this soap! I can&#x27;t seem to find it in my local stores but Amazon gets it to me fast. You feel clean and the scent stays with you for hours. Plus I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out with the big packs. I&#x27;ve bought them from Amazon twice and as long as they sell them I&#x27;ll keep buying them! As a bonus I don&#x27;t have the dry skin problems in the winter that I normally have.</li>
    <li> Its soap, this isn&#x27;t the soap I am used to like Dial or Irish Springs. I like it better than those and it does the job, I feel clean and smell nice after showering. I think the bars last longer than the other type.</li>
    <li> I really, really like this soap.  It smells great, cleans well, lathers great, and leaves me feeling refreshed.  My wife likes the smell of it.  It has an odor that smells good, but is still manly.  I couldn&#x27;t find it at stores, so I had to look to Amazon.  I bought about 10 years worth.    Seriously, I bought 64 bars...I like this soap that much.</li>
    <li> We had been using this soap for a while and our local grocery store  could not keep it in stock. Found  a source online. Product is equivalent to other Dial soaps as far as cleaning and odor protection but rinses clean with no residue feeling. Doesn&#x27;t have a perfumey smell.</li>
    <li> Cool smell. As far as I know gets me clean.</li>
    <li> At one time this was available in most retail stores, but for reasons unclear it became harder and harder to find locally but thanks to Amazon I can now get my male soap fix in quantity. Unlike other soaps or male oriented bathing bars, this one has a great aroma, works well, rinses off easily and leaves you smelling fresh and clean. Other products I have tried left you clean but were hard to rinse off and you ended up smelling like a perfume factory or worse like someone who prefers being fragrant over being simply clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> Thanks amazon and dial, i smell much better now!</li>
    <li> great buy. great price. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Coming from a dude who is not super picky about his soaps, I will say, this is not my favorite.  It cleans fine but the smell is very odd and tobacco-ey. The smell dissipates slightly over time, but when you first open the box, it is potent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps that is what Dial thinks that a &amp;#34;man&amp;#34; smells like,..?</li>
    <li> It is Dial how can you go wrong.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any advertisement on this product through media, but there should be. It is the best soap, for real men, I have found.</li>
    <li> I bought a bunch of soap at once because I thought it would be a good idea.  Now I&#x27;m conserving soap like some kind of hippie and I still have a bar left because I use them down to the last morsel.  I&#x27;m sick of the smell now too because I&#x27;ve used the same bars for too long.  It&#x27;s great for my skin though and it was cheap as all heck.  Get some.</li>
    <li> Do not like the sticky film that it leaves on your skin.</li>
    <li> I dontated this to my church for a mission trip to Panama. http://www.faithfulservantmissions.org/</li>
    <li> Seriously the best smelling mens soap I have ever used. I don&#x27;t often write reviews but this soap is that good. I can&#x27;t describe the scent very well but it just smells good. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Good price, smells good (very subtle masculine scent), and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
    <li> This Dial product makes showering a real privilege. Dial for Men Nutriskin 7 Bionutrients Soap works well with soft water and generates a vibrant clean feeling. Amazon&#x27;s price and delivery are wonderful. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I buy everything from Amazon for my home supplies however this item is a complete rip off. Now I know this is two packs of 8, however Target sells a single pack of 8 for $3.49 which surprises me how much more expensive Amazon is with this product.</li>
