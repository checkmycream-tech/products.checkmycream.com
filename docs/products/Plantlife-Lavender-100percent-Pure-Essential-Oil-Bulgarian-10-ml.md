      <li>I just love this smell.</li>
      <li>Fanastic product for a fantastic price!</li>
      <li>It is better to use it on the skin diluted with water as it can irritate a sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;The company is great</li>
      <li>The fragrance is strong enough and very pleasant.</li>
      <li>The lavender oil smells nice, but the true lavender scent is not as strong as I had hoped.  </li>
      <li>I ordered pure oil this time and it smells good (even though lavender it&#x60;s not my favourite</li>
      <li>Very good price for an essential oil.</li>
      <li>Excellent pure essential oil and the scent is amazing.</li>

      <li>I love lavender oil, and when I used up my first bottle of it, I decided to check out the lavender oils available on Amazon.  </li>

      <li>I received the product very quickly and it&#x27;s exactly what I needed and excpected!  </li>
      <li>A GOOD QUALITY LOW COST ALTERNATIVE!If</li>
      <li>good for various things.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a bad oil</li>
      <li>I love putting this into masks when I am doing a facial on a client, they love the smell too.</li>
      <li>Product came quick.</li>
      <li>I only wish there were more to the contents, but I am happy with it overall.</li>

      <li>Love lavender for the bath and as a natural cleanser for bamboo. .</li>
      <li>I recently tried their massage oils and they are really nice too.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very strong so only a drop or two is necessary, but I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s strong -</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never been a giant fan of lavender scented things, so I didn&#x27;t expect to be much impressed by this particular bottle of essential oil from my starter kit from PlantLife.</li>
      <li>Not too heavy and very effective.</li>
      <li>The pure oil is strong and pure; the scent is like smelling lavender in bloom; it can be applied to clothing or skin and creates no irritation.</li>
      <li>i can&#x27;t say that the scent it self helped with either one, but mind over matter right?</li>
      <li>I put some drops in my raw Shea butter and it worked great.  </li>
      <li>all as expected according to the reviews, very potent.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d buy more essential oils from this company.</li>
      <li>I will absolutely buy from this seller again!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Product came quick. What a beautiful smell. I sometimes have problems sleeping and this gets me in the mood to sleep. I put 5 drops in the bath.  It has a beautiful smell. I will continue to buy. Next time I will get a bigger bottle:)</li>
    <li> Pleased with everything I get from Plantlife! My go to company for essential oils!</li>
    <li> I was pleased to receive this bottle of Lavender oil as quickly as I did.  The lavender oil smells nice, but the true lavender scent is not as strong as I had hoped.  I have never bought lavender oil before, so perhaps this is how they all are.  I wanted to make a linen spray with the oil.  I only wish there were more to the contents, but I am happy with it overall.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use essential oils frequently but have been pleased with this product when I do.  Plantlife sent a couple samples with my order which is really amazing for such a small order.</li>
    <li> I purchased the lavender oil in the summer because I read that lavender oil repels mosquitoes. I am not sure that the oil repels insects, but it has a soothing smell that put me to sleep. However, only 1-2 drops on your bed sheets, pillow case, etc. is enough; otherwise the scent is too overpowering.</li>
    <li> I love lavender oil, and when I used up my first bottle of it, I decided to check out the lavender oils available on Amazon.  This Plantlife brand of oil smells great!  It is calming, and like some of the other reviewers noted, it works well when added to a cotton ball next to your pillow to give you restful sleep.  Below are some of the other uses for lavender that I use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Homemade body sugar scrub:  I use my favorite homemade sugar scrub recipe and add drops of lavender to the mix.  It smells so delicious and feels great in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Body Mist:  I add water, drops of lavender and orange oil (or any other essential oil) to an empty squirt bottle.  I use it to freshen up a room and when at work and I&#x27;m staring at the computer screen, I spray a couple of squirts in the air as a refresher.  It feels heavenly.  It helps keep me alert (in particular after lunch when feeling groggy), and perks up my mood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Homemade body oil:  This is one of my favorite uses of lavender oil.  I mix it with sweet almond oil (which is scentless), vitamin E oil, and orange essential oil to create the sweetest floral fruity body oil.  I rub it all over my body after a shower, and it feels so therapeutic.  It&#x27;s a great start to a day or the best nightcap before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know there are hundreds of other uses for lavender oil (and I&#x27;m going to check them out).  I am very pleased with this lavender oil and my uses of it.  I give this oil my HIGHEST Recommendation.  You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> Very good price for an essential oil. I use it (mixed with vodka and water) in my steam iron. Makes ironing an aromatherapy session, plus makes your room smell awesome.</li>
    <li> I have a problems with sleeping, so I started to use a lavender body oil at night. It helped me with relaxation and I fall asleep much faster! I ordered pure oil this time and it smells good (even though lavender it&#x60;s not my favourite smell).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x60;m gonna use it to balance my mood, for skin (for blemishes or add few drops to a face masks), for skin burns, insect bites, headaches and menstrual pain- 5 drops for a 5ml of a baby oil etc. It is better to use it on the skin diluted with water as it can irritate a sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;The company is great too-shipping is fast and I got 2 samples of their other products.</li>
    <li> not at all happy with product...has very little scent and does not last an hour...will not buy again.</li>
    <li> good for various things. I&#x27;m not a fan of lavender, although it does have therapeutic properties.</li>
    <li> I bought the smallest size just to test it.  And it is very nice.  No complaints.  The fragrance is strong enough and very pleasant.</li>
    <li> Great product to help you calm your nerves and help you relax. I put some drops on my pillow, sheets, and under my nose before bedtime and it really helps me to relax and get ready to sleep. My dog also loves it. He falls right off to sleep as soon as I open the container. It lasts for a long time. I now have to try the diffuser.</li>
    <li> Great product exactly as described!!&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast and even got some cute freebies in my order!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks:)</li>
    <li> I received the product very quickly and it&#x27;s exactly what I needed and excpected!  I will absolutely buy from this seller again!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a bad oil but it&#x27;s not the best lavender oil I&#x27;ve had for the same price.</li>
    <li> Lavender oil is great it makes you have sweet dreams if you add a few drops to your pillow at night. Works every time for a great nights rest. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I like it for the price but it could have been better. I am using it to get rid of my acne scars. I have used it for a few days. My skin texture has improved but the scars still are same. They probably will need more time to fade away. Other wise the aroma is good and definitely relaxing. It soothes acne prone skin. I highly recommend it to those who are looking for a cheaper option and are OK with a little watery quality. I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE an input ON A GOOD QUALITY LOW COST ALTERNATIVE!If anybody who has experience with buying essential oils would please suggest something!!</li>
    <li> all the plant life oil&#x27;s ive bought were kinda crappy. they smell good for like 15 minutes then vanish. So I just use them in my daughters bath.</li>
    <li> a great quality essential oil.  I use it in the bath and also wear it under my nose when I need to calm down.  I&#x27;d buy more essential oils from this company.</li>
    <li> Pure and geniue smell, and comes with massage and soap gifts. I will buy the 6 bottles gift pack next time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an esthetician and have used it not only for the water I soak my towels in, but also with my massage serum...my clients have fallen for it! As soon as I touch their face, they&#x27;ve all said \\&quot;mmmm...what IS that?!?\\&quot; ;D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other lavender essential oils, and this is by far my favorite. Fanastic product for a fantastic price! I&#x27;ll definitely be buying again!!!</li>
    <li> Great quality, great company, they even sent me a handwritten note. And a lemongrass bar of soap. Thank you! Would buy again. Why better quality than other brands I have tried. I Used this for everything...helps me and my husband to relax. And it was great in my soap recipe.</li>
    <li> I love putting this into masks when I am doing a facial on a client, they love the smell too.</li>
    <li> all as expected according to the reviews, very potent.</li>
    <li> Smells too strong for aroma therapy.</li>
    <li> uhhh...it seemed like there were only two drops in&lt;br /&gt;the whole bottle but yeah it smells good not sure if&lt;br /&gt;it works to cure toe fungus</li>
    <li> It would be a good idea when selling to Americans that the product be labeled in ounces and not in the metric system. I didn&#x27;t buy the product due to this error and won&#x27;t as long as it is used.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in the 10mL vial.  Wow, what a great essential oil!  This comes in a glass vial and is of very high quality.  One can easily tell that this is the real deal, and no gimmick.  It smells great and lasts long.  A+++</li>
    <li> Smell is perfect!!!!!! Shipping was very good! it was before they said it was going to be..! definatelly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I just wanted to say that Dr. Oz recommended Lavender oil for men who have receding hair.  I don&#x27;t know if it really works, but we are trying it on my husband.  I do like it for myself for its other medicinal values.  I used it just this morning for a \\&quot;pick me up\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying Plantlife&#x27;s Lavender oil (and other essential oils) for about two years and this is definitely my favorite one. I&#x27;ve used other lavender oils before this one and while they&#x27;re all 100% pure essential oil, the others&#x27; scents don&#x27;t last as long or have a funky smell to them. I usually just use it in my burner which I&#x27;ve also purchased from Plantlife, but it&#x27;s also great for adding scents to bath salts or moisturizers (it&#x27;s best to dilute it). Each bottle lasts about 6 months for me with regular use. The scent is very purely lavender and VERY soothing.</li>
    <li> I got this lavender oil when I had an ear infection. I took the anitbiotics for the 2 weeks that the dr. said to and it didn&#x27;t even touch it.  I didn&#x27;t want to go on more, so I tried lavender oil. It worked. 5 days later my ear infection cleared up. All it took was a few drops in my ear twice a day.  This is my new treatment for ear infections!</li>
    <li> I received this purchase quickly and in perfect condition.  What a wonderfully relaxing aroma!  I recommend this for making Yule presents - bath salts, bath oil, lotion, etc.  Reconstitutes perfectly with any medium.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been a giant fan of lavender scented things, so I didn&#x27;t expect to be much impressed by this particular bottle of essential oil from my starter kit from PlantLife. But its soft, pleasingly sweet but cool fragrance instantly changed my opinion of lavender! I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ve managed to live 24 years without experiencing TRUE lavender in this form, but it has definitely been worth the wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product helps me SLEEP!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some of you that might not be a big deal. My husband, for instance, falls asleep almost before he manages to get horizontal (the pinhead)-- but I have ALWAYS had an enormous amount of difficulty dropping off. My mind just seems to whirl and agonize and fret and churn until I&#x27;m so frustrated and exhausted that sleep is completely impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, using a few drops of this oil on a cotton ball or tissue and breathing it in for a few minutes in bed, I can actually fall asleep within half an hour. That is COMPLETELY unheard of for me. I am soooo grateful and excited about this newfound ability to gain restful slumber!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this oil can be used for many other things, but I highly recommend this product especially to anyone who has difficulty falling asleep or relaxing. And it&#x27;s so inexpensive, what is there to lose?</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lavender oil. All of Plantlife&#x27;s products are great and are the oils i prefer to use. I recently tried their massage oils and they are really nice too. Not too heavy and very effective.</li>
    <li> Pleasant calming fragrance. Put a couple drops on a cotton ball and place on night stand or near pillow. Fragrance calms and soothes to help sleep. Seems to work better each night as one associates fragrance with sleep; fall asleep faster.</li>
    <li> I am using to lighten, remove my tattoo. I am applying a couple times a day. This will take eight months or so. getridtattoo.coim</li>
    <li> The smell is so sweet and delicious.  I put some drops in my raw Shea butter and it worked great.  It is not a very expensive product here and they even sent me a little gift! It was a neat surprise.  Will definitely recommend and buy again.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I just tested this stuff on my wrist to see how it smelled.  It didn&#x27;t smell like what I&#x27;d come to expect lavender to smell like AND it left a small round burn on my wrist were I put it.  Now I&#x27;m terrified to try this for any of the relaxing health remedies described for it...</li>
    <li> Love it.....put a couple drops in tube of toilet paper roll when changing roll and it keeps bathroom smelling great.</li>
    <li> Great smelling lavender, great for putting on your pillow to smell while sleeping, nice product, good price and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I love lavender oil and I&#x27;ve always had good success with Plantlife products.  I would definitely recommend plantlife oils for sure!</li>
    <li> These essential oils seem very watery and possibly aren&#x27;t as pure as they say. I only use Be Young essential oils now #14998.</li>
    <li> Excellent pure essential oil and the scent is amazing. Plantlife is great!  Add 10 drops to my home made hair conditioner. It&#x27;s beneficial to your hair and scalp. Promotes hair growth, helps to get rid of itchy scalp and dandruff and it&#x27;s scent is very relaxing.</li>
    <li> Smells very nice, use it to relax for when I go to sleep. You can put some on your pillow case and it smells very pleasant.</li>
    <li> Super product with a great smell.  I use it in a spray for my husband&#x27;s pillow to relax him after a hard day at work.  He just loves the smell of lavender.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> This oil is the best lavender oil ever! Blends well with Younique&#x27;s Rose Water for custom lavender water.</li>
    <li> The pure oil is strong and pure; the scent is like smelling lavender in bloom; it can be applied to clothing or skin and creates no irritation. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to. I use this for aroma-therapy, to make my hair smell nice after a cleansing rinse, and much more. It&#x27;s very strong so only a drop or two is necessary, but I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s strong - that&#x27;s less I have to use. I ordered over 6 months ago and I still have so much of the bottle left. When I&#x27;m out I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I ordered from this same seller from whom I ordered eucalyptus essential oil awhile back. I was so pleased with the last order, I ordered again. This is now my go-to seller for essential oils. I placed the order on Dec. 3rd and it was in my hands today, Dec. 5th, having come from the opposite US coast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lavender essential oil smells just like it was fresh-picked out of an herb garden! Bottle came in plenty of bubble wrap, perfectly sealed, and the dropper works great. The reasonable prices aren&#x27;t too shabby, either.  I put 15 drops of it in a squeeze bottle with baby oil and now I have an amazing body wash in the shower or even just something to slather on before I go to sleep.</li>
    <li> It smells lovely!  I bought the lavender essential oil to put behind my mask at work because I have a horribly stinky job. This lavender has helped me to not get nauseous with disgust and barf all over the place when I&#x27;m working.  They even sent me a sample bar of lavender soap with my purchase which I loved. I may be buying some for my mom and sisters in the future.</li>
    <li> I only bought this for my meditations and to add a little bit of it to my pillow at night so that I could get a good night sleep. i can&#x27;t say that the scent it self helped with either one, but mind over matter right? All I can really say is that the scent is very good and it did relax me a bit.</li>
    <li> 2 0 1 2&lt;br /&gt;todo excelente, todo listo, entrega y satisfacion garantizada, buen material&lt;br /&gt;2 0 1 2&lt;br /&gt;2 0 1 2</li>
    <li> I like to put this on a cotton ball next to my bed. Smells wonderful, and calming right before you fall asleep.</li>
    <li> A few drops in the bath... nice!  Had a minor burn on my face from the curling iron.  A dab of lavender oil and instant relief!</li>
    <li> I was wanting to try a new scent, especially to help me sleep at night.  This was the perfect size for me to try.</li>
    <li> This smells sooo good.  I use it in my homemade laundry detergent as well as burning it.  I just love this smell.</li>
    <li> Love lavender for the bath and as a natural cleanser for bamboo. .</li>
    <li> A good quality product</li>
    <li> I have ordered Plantlife Lavender Oil numerous times and I am 100% satisfied with the quality!  I have only tried one other lavender oil previously that I purchased from a spa.  The scent and price are no comparison to Plantlife&#x27;s.  This oil is by far my #1 choice among oils for quality, price and shipping.</li>
    <li> Love this ,I put it in a vaporizor and on a cloth in the pillowcase. I believe in its relaxing aroma</li>
    <li> Great value, smelled wonderful</li>
    <li> first timer here, just discovered essential oils, and lavender goes everywhere, i think im using too much because my bottles go by too quickly, i think I enjoy smelling it constantly and since lavender, like tea tree dont need to b diluted i tend to get carried away.&lt;br /&gt;fast shipping, and safely packaged.</li>
