<ol>
    <li> Removes nail polish on first try!</li>
    <li> It takes up to 4 layers of nail polish off within 30 seconds. It doesn&#x27;t get any better than that. Of course, since it contains acetone, it has a strong smell and can dry your skin out, but it&#x27;s nail polish remover, so that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
    <li> It works! I don&#x27;t use nail polish often, sooooooo I&#x27;m afraid I may not be the best judge of the extra strength claim.&lt;br /&gt;It does seem to work quickly though, and does not seem to be more harsh than other ones I have used.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is nothing to speak of, neither good nor bad.</li>
    <li> ok product.  nothing i wouldn&#x27;t have expected from polish remover</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the first time that I receive something all spilled and I bought 2. I waste my money. I want refund</li>
    <li> Not strong scented. Shipped triple wrapped for safety and is a larger bottle than I thought it would be. You get alot for the add on price. Works really fast and doesnt sting like other removers. Quality goes along way so you dont need to use as much as cheap off name brands.</li>
    <li> LOVED THIS! WORKS GREAT! I usually buy nail polish remover from my local pharmacies or stores like walgreens and cvs... never thought of using this but i saw the price of it here on Amazon, so i decided to give it a try and i loved it. it does the job, removes the polish much better from the ones i&#x27;ve used in the past. i&#x27;m giving it a 4 stars though because i haven&#x27;t tried the other brands yet so i can&#x27;t really compare. overall, i&#x27;m going to be using this, great price, great quality remover.</li>
    <li> Huge bottle :) definitely will be buying it again</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove easily. Have to apply two three times.</li>
    <li> This works alright, but it didn&#x27;t take off my shimmery nail polish any faster than the Cutex brand I was using before. It does have a nicer scent than other nail polish removers. The opening is wide, so if you use small cotton balls, there could be spillage. Overall, just an average product.</li>
    <li> I got this as an add-on for $2.49---what a great buy!  Does the job well and is a lot of remover--will last me for a long time!</li>
    <li> Does the job of taking off 4 or 5 layers of polish with a cotton pad. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my nails like other removers.</li>
    <li> It works good as I expected!</li>
    <li> Great product!!  Arrived in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Remover is good works like it should.. Ordered it with  lot of other small items so it want too costly.  I&#x27;m housebound nd penny on other to shop for me so this was perfect for me.</li>

    <li> Great price and it works wells.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.  I guess nail polish remover isn&#x27;t as strong as it used to be.  Took a lot of rubbing to remove polish.</li>
    <li> Works well even on the toughest polish. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> nice product will buy again.</li>
    <li> this was such a bad buy because the nail polish remover was open and empty. Do not waste your money on this</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s intended to do.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell. But polish remover all have that.</li>
    <li> Pretty much removes nail polish the moment it makes contact. As it should! Works equally well on gloss and glitter based polishes also. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Was delivered all spilled. Want refund.</li>
    <li> easily removes nail polish and the glitter nail polish too.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised how fast this remover worked, is faster then any other that I have try....</li>
