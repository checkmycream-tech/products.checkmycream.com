      <li>Yes, one does have to keep using it, and I do use gloves to do most anything.</li>
      <li>Since it did such a good job the first time, and my nails aren&#x27;t great, but they are better than without using the DermaNail, so I&#x27;d encourage anyone with nail problems to give it a try.</li>
      <li>This product is the best I&#x27;ve ever found ... and I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on my nails trying to stop the splitting.  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this consistently on my nails and they have never looked better!</li>
      <li>My nails are strong, they don&#x27;t peel and break like they did before.</li>
      <li>This product you are supposed to use before a strong moisturizer, so at night I use TIPPS after using, and during the day I use Cutemol, the product they sell it with.</li>
      <li>This product will help you grow strong nails.</li>
      <li>my nails will be strong again.</li>
      <li>This product has restored my thin,splitting nails into healthly, strong nails.  </li>
      <li>It makes a huge difference.</li>
      <li>Like TIPPS is primarily soy bean oil.</li>
      <li>I would recommend ProStrong, available through QVC or the ProStrong website, any day over the Dermanail product.</li>
      <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t understand how this product would work, because the texture is very watery and reminds me of rubbing alcohol.</li>
      <li>have nothing but praise for this product, and hope it will always be available for my nail emergencies.</li>
      <li>One could say this time so far so good.</li>
      <li>It is easy to apply and dries quickly.  </li>
      <li>The first bottle from Drug store site seems to have worked better than this bottle.</li>
      <li>I purchased the first bottle at his office and, for convenience sake, just ordered more on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it takes to see significant results.</li>
      <li>and we both see significant improvement in our fingernails.</li>
      <li>I started this product 3 weeks ago at my dermatologists suggestion, along with the special cream that comes with the DermaNail solution,  and I am also using the Trind Balsam.</li>
      <li>After a few weeks I noticed a huge difference and by 12 weeks I had beautiful nails of iron.  </li>
      <li>Dermanail on its own, completely disappears, which is a plus, too.</li>
      <li>I tried this product for the full 16 weeks hoping it would prevent breakage.</li>
      <li>I had to use almost the whole first bottle before my nails really looked good.</li>
      <li>I wear chemical free top coat clear polish on my fingernails.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and I still have about a third of a bottle left, so the value over time is excellent too!</li>
      <li>My shipment was fast and easy to order on Amazon.com</li>
      <li>DermaNail is the first nail product I&#x27;ve ever used that does what it&#x27;s suppose to do!  </li>
      <li>Cutemol is a very thick, lanolin based cream that is best used at bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have been using this for about nine weeks, and can now say that it is well worth all of the effort.  </li>
      <li>Go for it, gals, it will be worth the month</li>
      <li>high quality product which leaves great satisfaction in their use and price-wise is accessible to everyone reason that I recommend is widely purchased by anyone interested</li>
      <li>I use it right before I go to bed, and as I am leaving the house so that I will not get water on my nails for an hour after putting the Dermanail on.</li>
      <li>I ordered it right away.  </li>
      <li>Only problem is that the cap unscrews VERY easily when traveling with the bottle</li>
      <li>The application is very easy, and takes only seconds.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for the past two years and now am proud of my hands.</li>
      <li>Fingernails splitting in two across ridges may not sound like much of a health issue to those who haven&#x27;t experienced it</li>
      <li>I followed the instructions exactly and still had this problem</li>
      <li>This was first prescribed by a dermatologist.</li>
      <li>I used two bottles, exactly as instructed, and nothing changed for me.  </li>
      <li>Its exactly what I ordered.</li>
      <li>When I use it only at bedtime, my nails are still okay.  </li>
      <li>Sure enough that guarantee is written on the box.  </li>
      <li>Once you get your nails where &#x27;want them&#x27; you can cut back from 2x a day to 1x a day and after 6 more weeks to just a couple times a week.</li>
      <li>and I do see where my peeling is starting to get better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using this product for about 3 weeks now and my nails are definitely a lot better...</li>
      <li>The first four weeks</li>
      <li>WHEN I am consistent and use once or twice a day my nails all grow.  </li>
      <li>I was only able to apply DermaNail once a day</li>
      <li>My nails are now long, strong and dont peel!  </li>
      <li>I usually see the results after about a month of using it, and once the nails are repaired they remain strong and beautiful for a very long time.</li>
      <li>You do have to use the product twice daily for a month or so before you see the full result, but it is worth the wait!</li>
      <li>I will be a forever customer as long as it is available to customers!</li>
      <li>It worked very well the first 6 months that I used it,so I stopped using it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I purchased this product in hopes of it helping my dry and peeling nails. It did not help mine at all. I felt it was an expensive lesson learned. It may work for someone else but for me I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this product on the advise of my niece. We both suffered from weak, peeling nails. I would try to let mine grow, but they would bend and split before very long. So frustrating!! The application is very easy, and takes only seconds. You do have to use the product twice daily for a month or so before you see the full result, but it is worth the wait! My nails are strong, they don&#x27;t peel and break like they did before. My niece has the same positive result. I have been using this for over 3 months and I still have about a third of a bottle left, so the value over time is excellent too! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> After three glorious months of gel manicures and then six months of pathetic, peeling, splitting, broken nails, I asked my dermatologist for advice. Other than to stay away from gel manicures, she recommended this product. I was initially taken back by the price, but my nails were embarrassing. I haven&#x27;t been using this product for very long, less than three weeks, but my nails have stopped peeling and feel stronger. This is a very encouraging sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a clear liquid that goes on with a small rod inside the cap. You place a few drops at the base of the nail and then allow the fluid to flow over the rest of the nail and let it dry without touching or massaging it into the nail. You then apply a good moisturizer on top.You are supposed to do this twice a day, but sometimes I forget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the application of DermaNail, my nails look somewhat dull but look better after I apply the moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer recommends Cutemol Emollient Cream (which it makes) to be used in conjunction with DermaNail. Cutemol is a very thick, lanolin based cream that is best used at bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully, I will continue to get good results. It&#x27;s going to take at least another two months before I know for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 6/18/2013:&lt;br /&gt;It has been almost six weeks since I started using DermaNail and I am very surprised how well it is working! The peeling and the splitting were the first to stop but now most of the chipping and breaking has been eliminated or greatly reduced. Very little of my original damaged nail is left, perhaps 1/4 of an inch and I can see the stronger, healthier nail growing in. I have been using the product twice a day, followed by either Cutemol or Argan oil massaged into the nail and cuticles.</li>
    <li> I tried this product, and while it helped my nails to some extent, there was not much difference. It also caused cracks, very painful and deep, around my fingernails as it is so drying. I had one crack that was so painful I had to bandage up my finger for 3 days. I realized that it was the adipic acid in the product that was making the cracks. The product is too drying, even if you apply moisturizer immediately afterwards, as they recommend. I followed the instructions exactly and still had this problem so I gave up on the product. I have since switched to ProStrong fluoride nail treatment and it is much better. It is a brush-on formula that absorbs into the nail EVEN THROUGH POLISH and has completely transformed my nails. I would recommend ProStrong, available through QVC or the ProStrong website, any day over the Dermanail product.</li>
    <li> One of the best products I have used on my nails.  I get hang nails frequently and this has helped me from getting them. recommend this</li>
    <li> I have had ridges across some of my nails for about as long as I can remember. These bumpy nails also had no cuticle. I started using derma nail mid January and by the end of April, the ridges have grown out. The bumpy nails also flaked at the end into layers, but the treatment has fixed that problem too. I used in conjunction with cutemol.</li>
    <li> I used this product as instructed for 4 months.  It produced no change in my nails at all.  I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> My entire life, my nails have been paper thin and have rarely grown beyond the fingertip. In my thirties and forties, I used acrylics for periods of time, because I was so embarrassed by my unsightly nails...then,tiring of the time and expense involved in the \\&quot;filling\\&quot; of artificial nails, I would let them grow out (it took &gt;6mos. each time), only to have them look worse than before.  As I entered my 50&#x27;s, I noticed that a white, horizontal crack would begin in the middle of my nail which would begin to split and break off, even before it reached the end of my fingertip!  When I complained to my dermatologist, he recommended that I might try DermaNail and a Biotin supplement.  I figured I would give it a shot and ordered a couple of bottles of DermaNail.  This was over a year ago and I was, admittedly, not faithful to the twice daily application so I did not have the desired result and shortly thereafter, abandoned \\&quot;Project Nail Growth\\&quot;. As I envisioned a busy summer of weddings and family celebrations, I resigned myself to getting acrylics for the summer so as not have jagged, painfully short nails.  Then, I decided to give DermaNail one last try. Each morning I took the minute to apply the liquid to my nail bed and left a bottle on my nightstand to apply before I went to bed.  The first four weeks I saw no noticeable improvement and had to keep filing down the cracked part of my nails as they grew out.  Then it happened; the white cracks disappeared as the nail bed improved and the nails became stronger and healthier as they got longer.  It has now been ten weeks since I began treatment and my nails are smooth and healthy. The tips are strong and white and there are no striations in the nail. My hands now have a tapered look and I have received many compliments from friends who are acrylics users!  Additionally, I like the fact that one can wear nail polish and still be able to apply the product effectively.  I am ordering two more bottles and am sure that this will be a permanent regimen for me.  By the way, I also take the biotin when I remember it!</li>
    <li> This product will help you grow strong nails. I have been using it for the past two years and now am proud of my hands.</li>
    <li> Order handled quickly and product packaged carefully.  Still waiting for the results of use but nails showing improvement already (3 weeks).</li>
    <li> This is recommended by my dermatologist.  They have a photo of it in the office - it says \\&quot;Nails of Steel\\&quot;.  Mine no longer split into the nailbed after using it.  Using the Cutemol cream with it is also very helpful.</li>
    <li> This product is the best I&#x27;ve ever found ... and I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on my nails trying to stop the splitting.  It&#x27;s slow but sure.  I am alergic to polish so this product is very simple to use on bare nails.</li>
    <li> I actually purchased DermaNail for my mother. Her words: \\&quot;It&#x27;s working great!\\&quot; She had very weak nails that were splitting at the ends. Not only that but the splits were occuring below the point where the nail seperates from the skin, so they were actually causing her pain. She has been using DermaNail for about 2 weeks now and the splits are closed up. The nails also look stronger, less fragile.</li>
    <li> I have been using DermaNail for several years now and it&#x27;s great.  My nails are strong and look great.  My dermatologist recommended it when my nails were splitting.  I use it twice a day.  It takes less than a minute to apply.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product as per directions since I have gotten it and my nails are still brittle.  I was so excited to get it since the commercial seemed to make this product so promising.  Perhaps I need to still use it but I thought I should see some results by the sixth week, but I still will use it until the eight week and hopefully I will see some improvement.  But right now my nails are still fragile and still cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product may not be for everyone ... But it doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work for you.  It just was a disappointment for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to all those who purchase this product in the future.</li>
    <li> My nails were the bane of my existence. Splitting, peeling, nail polish would peel or chip after a day or so.  My mother&#x27;s dermatologist told her about DermaNail and she bought a bottle for me.  After a few weeks I noticed a huge difference and by 12 weeks I had beautiful nails of iron.  You shouldn&#x27;t wear nail polish with this product but I still have occasional manicures and have my nails buffed.  I love this product!</li>
    <li> After years of battling brittle, breaking nails, I have finally found a product that actually works !  I won&#x27;t be without it in the future.</li>
    <li> I got it Monday three days early.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a five star rating because it came three days early.&lt;br /&gt;This stop works, this is my second bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got my grandmother long nails, I let them grow a little long. Not super long because I am a guy.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I started using this product. I wear chemical free top coat clear polish on my fingernails.&lt;br /&gt;I notice my fingernails will crack on the side, I cut the crack nail off  this stop my fingernails from cracking.&lt;br /&gt;I been using it faithful for one month.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. My nails improve a lot when I use it. Results are seen after several weeks of using the product.</li>
    <li> I have a crack that travels the length of the nail. I used DermaNail for 5 weeks and it had no effect.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product, though it takes a couple months to see results. My shipment was fast and easy to order on Amazon.com</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this product for about 3 weeks now and my nails are definitely a lot better...I can&#x27;t wait to see how they will look in 8 to 10 weeks.</li>
    <li> I work in a Dermatology office and decided to give this a try. This bottle is liquid gold!!!  My nails began growing (they were PAINFULLY broken and weak) and almost 6 weeks later they are growing so much and extremely strong.  I honestly didn&#x27;t understand how this product would work, because the texture is very watery and reminds me of rubbing alcohol. I am happy with my beautiful nails and would pay twice as much for this OUTSTANDING product!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. If your nails are not strong get this. It makes a huge difference. I use it every day.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist.  My nails are weak and split often. I have not had much success with other products.  DermaNail is applied twice daily:  morning and evening.  It takes a while but I was pleased with the results.  However, when I ran out, I noticed that my nails began to split again.  I don&#x27;t think you can wear polish while using this product.  Check with the manufacturer.  I am now on my second bottle and my nails already feel stronger.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd time I have purchased this product, first time I questioned it and after going without it for some time decided to try it again.  haven&#x27;t used it very long this time so I am waiting to see how good it works. One could say this time so far so good.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist told me about DermaNail.  I have used it for several years.  When I use it twice a day, my nails do really well.  When I use it only at bedtime, my nails are still okay.  I had to use almost the whole first bottle before my nails really looked good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years because I have terrible nails if I don&#x27;t use this product. My dermatologist told me to get this product and to use it twice a day, every day. I use it right before I go to bed, and as I am leaving the house so that I will not get water on my nails for an hour after putting the Dermanail on. I quit it once for a while, and I was sorry because my nails went right back to splitting and cracking. I&#x27;ll never quit it again!</li>
    <li> I tried this product for the full 16 weeks hoping it would prevent breakage. I have very hard nail that are prone to breaking close to the quick and I saw no improvement at all. The 80% isopropyl alcohol is also EXTREMELY drying and hard on the cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am taking advantage of their satisfaction guarantee - the representative I spoke with was a tad surly - I hope they stand behind their product like they say they do.</li>
    <li> In all honesty, I didn&#x27;t use this every single day religiously, but fairly close.  I really did not notice any major difference one way or the other. After reading other reviews, I was hopeful but as usual, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.</li>
    <li> high quality product which leaves great satisfaction in their use and price-wise is accessible to everyone reason that I recommend is widely purchased by anyone interested</li>
    <li> I used this product just as the directions said, but I&#x27;m not actually sure it had any effect at all.  Didn&#x27;t harm me though, as another reviewer reported.  Not much more to say.</li>
    <li> I need to use this on a continual basis. My nails will never be perfect but they are so much improved with this product that I do not intend to stop using it, ever.</li>
    <li> I have tried many things recommended for weak, splitting nails.  DermaNail is the only thing that&#x27;s worked.  I recommend it to everybody I know.</li>
    <li> DermaNail is the first nail product I&#x27;ve ever used that does what it&#x27;s suppose to do!  It was recommended to me by my dermatologist, who has his mother using it.  My nails are no longer vertically split and peeling.  They are very strong.  My husband uses it, loves it.  I bought a bottle for my 13 yr old grandaughter...her nails were so thin and looked aweful.  She has used it all summer and now has white tips on her nails.</li>
    <li> My nails are in desparate need of help so I thought I&#x27;d try this.  You&#x27;re supposed to use it twice a day, but it&#x27;s in a 1 oz. glass bottle with a plastic rod instead of a brush.  Two smaller bottles (like an eye drops bottle) would have been much easier to carry and use.&lt;br /&gt;Because of the awkwardness in applying it, I haven&#x27;t been as faithful as I should, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement at all in two weeks.</li>
    <li> My nails are slowly improving.  The key word is patience.  It takes a while for the old nails to grown out and the treated ones to grow in.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a week now and I do see where my peeling is starting to get better. I use cream on my nails about 3 times a day and at night I use argon oil and coco butter and wear cotton gloves to bed at night. I will write a review later after I have been using it for a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t perform as advertised my nails are still breaking and I have been using it for over 2 months.</li>
    <li> I have had incredible results with DermaNail. After four months of consistent use, my nails have been transformed from weak, thin and peeling to long and healthy.</li>
    <li> My wife used this product. She said it worked ok.</li>
    <li> I ordered \\&quot;Derma Nail\\&quot; from Amazon because the local pharmacy where I normally purchased it closed.  This product has restored my thin,splitting nails into healthly, strong nails.  It is an amazing product and I will be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> Suffering too long with severely peeling nails, I finally asked a dermatologist if there was anything to be done.  He recommended DermaNail which has been marvelous!  It does take a while to see results because it works in the nail bed, and nails do grow slowly, but now I have nails!</li>
    <li> Since the age of 13 I&#x27;ve always had well manicured nails.  After undergoing chemotherapy my nails were destroyed.  I desperately tried anything to help them grow but the tips ripped off as though they were made out of paper.  I took mega doses of Biotin and gelatin in hopes it would turn my nails around.  Nothing worked until I saw my dermatologist and told him of my problem with my nails.  He recommended *DermaNail* and told me it had 100% money back guarantee.  If I didn&#x27;t like DermaNail all I had to do was mail the cap and rod to the company and they would return all of my money.  Sure enough that guarantee is written on the box.  I love this product and will continue to purchase it and use it.</li>
    <li> It works!  One must be patient, but results will occur w/ in the expected time frame given.  Do it now.</li>
    <li> I had a thumb nail that had a permanent split mid nail - has gone on for years.  Bought this at my dermatologist&#x27;s recommendation.  WHEN I am consistent and use once or twice a day my nails all grow.  My poor thumb nail is way better even if I forget for a week or two.  The permanent split is gone.</li>
    <li> Okay, you need to try this stuff! It takes at least 8-12 weeks, because you applit it to the base of your nail by your cuticle. Then, your nail needs to grow out fully. You WILL see a difference!  My whole life, I was a nail biter. Short, stumpy nails that peeled. I wore acrylics, wraps, UV gel, and those the UV color polishes - but they left my nails a mess.  I used this upon the advise of my dermatologist. After 3 months, YES - my nails grew! I apply this product to the base by the cuticle, and on the edges when I wear nailpolish and it keeps my polish on for a full week. Ladies, do yourselves a favor - I never would have thought this stuff would work but I am ordering my fourth bottle today. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is what miracles are made of. I&#x27;ve been using this consistently on my nails and they have never looked better! Due to my nails being thin, chipping and breaking I&#x27;ve never been able to grow them out until now. It&#x27;s not a quick fix. It&#x27;s a nail corrector for new growth. Be patient during use and you will be pleased with the end results.</li>
    <li> Love it. I have exhausted every other possibility. This really works</li>
    <li> only thing that works</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so sorry to say but I was very disappointed with this product.  I read many, many reviews before ordering this product and was so hopeful that it would give me the nails I&#x27;ve always wanted.  I used two bottles, exactly as instructed, and nothing changed for me.  I&#x27;m still so disappointed as it was my last hope for nice nails.</li>
    <li> The product says it is not a quick fix as it takes 8 to 16 weeks to show improvement.  It has been a little over 9 weeks and I do see improvement.  My nails were cracked with ridges. They are now stronger and the ridges are beginning t fade.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 wks and my nails seem to be stronger and ridges seem to be disappearing.</li>
    <li> Over this past year my nails have been horrible.  I have always had great nails with length and strong.  Working with Derma Nail I do see a difference over this past month.  Need to use it for 8 weeks for full benefit, so still applying it daily.  Now need to reorder.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just about finished with my first bottle after using for several months.  The only thing it has done for me is dry out my cuticles.  Definitely not the result I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I have found that actually helps strengthen and grow my nails.  Only problem is that the cap unscrews VERY easily when traveling with the bottle and I have had two bottles open and drain while in transit.</li>
    <li> Still having major problems with my nails.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this nail conditioner about a week and I like it, so give it a try, I see a change in my nails.</li>
    <li> I am on week 5 and finally see a difference, buy 2 bottles you will need the second bottle.  Once you get your nails where &#x27;want them&#x27; you can cut back from 2x a day to 1x a day and after 6 more weeks to just a couple times a week.</li>
    <li> This product really helps my nails not only grow but grow stronger.&lt;br /&gt;Been buying it for several years now along with the nail cream.</li>
    <li> My fingernails were cracked and split from my chemo.....they are finally filling in with new growth that is not splitting or peeling!  Yippee!</li>
    <li> This is awesome best nail product I&#x27;ve ever bought</li>
    <li> Dermanail is an amazing product for people with weak, chipping, splitting nails.  After 3 months of use, my nails have really improved.  To be able to enjoy healthy fingernails is such a joy.  I&#x27;ll continue this amazing product.</li>
    <li> I have very weak and brittle nails.  Using this product has helped them become much stronger.  I could not have any length on my nails until using this product.</li>
    <li> This Product was recommended by our family doctor.  It seems to be working, very slowly. Product as expected and ordered.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have been using this for about 5 weeks and we both see significant improvement in our fingernails. We both work as poker dealers and the felt on the tables is hard on our nails. I have a problem with thin flakey nails, and my husbands split. We both like what we see so far.</li>
    <li> Its a standard nail conditioner product.  I did not see a big differnce after finishing the entire bottle.  Applied as directed, twice a day for 3 months.  Maybe less peeling, but my nails still very prone to rips and snags.</li>
    <li> I ordered it right away.  I mean, I had been scared enough of the condition to go to the Doctor, after all.  Within four weeks my nails were not only resealing to my fingers, they were actually growing!  I was beginning to see the whites at the end of my fingernails that I had not seen in years.  I am never giving this stuff up!&lt;br /&gt;  Since you only put a drop on each finger, the one ounce bottle lasts a little over a year with me, so do not be scared of the price.  This little bottle of medical magic is definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> It takes from 6 weeks to 3 months to know whether this stuff works. I can&#x27;t evaluate it until then.</li>
    <li> Supposed to get my money back if it doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;Wrote to company - never responded. THANKS for honoring your guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nails still weak, thin and peeling. Dermatologist cannot offer any more advice - he had faith in this stuff. Why, I dunno.</li>
    <li> I used this product for 8 weeks and saw slight results.</li>
    <li> Fingernails splitting in two across ridges may not sound like much of a health issue to those who haven&#x27;t experienced it but six of mine were constantly splitting for several years despite all my efforts to protect them. I&#x27;ve read many theories as to why annoying and painful ridges form (arthritis? hands in water too much? use of nail polish or polish remover? metal fingernail files? advancing age? poor nutrition? genetics? global warming?). I tried many products, including a wide array of cuticle creams, but ridges continued to form so I sought help from my dermatologist who recommended DermaNail. I purchased the first bottle at his office and, for convenience sake, just ordered more on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a long time for me to see results from that first bottle of DermaNail, as it should be applied twice daily for 16 weeks, allowing ridges to smooth out from the growing base of nails (where they start splitting) all the way to the tips. I was only able to apply DermaNail once a day so my results were slow in coming, but thankfully, all ridges have disappeared and I still have half a bottle of DermaNail left - a little goes a long long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend keeping hands dry, using work gloves to protect hands when cleaning or prepping foods, and being sure to apply moisturizer on fingertips during the day and overnight. I also recommend eating gelatine now and then - not sure why, but when I do, I find that my nails stay strong and break less often.</li>
    <li> My nails, especially after menopause, started splitting, or peeling at the tips. I tried TIPPS, and it worked, but left my fingers so greasy. This product you are supposed to use before a strong moisturizer, so at night I use TIPPS after using, and during the day I use Cutemol, the product they sell it with. Sometimes I wonder if you just use Cutemol and keep moisturized (like TIPPS does) the peeling is as much curtailed. Like TIPPS is primarily soy bean oil. I have been tempted to use TIPPS on one hand, and soy bean oil on the other... but I digress. The combo of Dermanail and a grease honestly for sure cures the peeling nail tips I used to have. Yes, one does have to keep using it, and I do use gloves to do most anything. And, you have to keep using grease of some sort to really make it work. Cutemol does sink in, and works great. And yes, takes patience. Dermanail on its own, completely disappears, which is a plus, too. Do not hesitate, it is cheap, unlike TIPPS, at least for what you get!</li>
    <li> All my life I&#x27;ve had a terrible time growing out my nails, only to have them split off and leave me with jagged and uneven nails and miserable hang nails.  I tried the acrylics, which caused itching and reactions and more cuticle peeling, plus I tried &amp;#34;gels&amp;#34;, weekly regular manicures (both wet and dry) and everything else in between.  It was agony getting rid of the artificial nails. I started this product 3 weeks ago at my dermatologists suggestion, along with the special cream that comes with the DermaNail solution,  and I am also using the Trind Balsam. The trio of products is already helping. If I forget the application, woe is me when I am away from home. I strongly recommend the DermaNail to anyone looking to leave the land of dry fingernails and cuticles. I don&#x27;t think I will even return to nail polish. This is a god send and a terrific product. The prices are about the same from Amazon, maybe a little more from the dermatologist, but every dollar spent on this nail repair is worth it to have pride once again in my personal appearance. Go for it, gals, it will be worth the month it takes to see significant results. Also, give the Trind Balsam a try. It does help the entire process, and makes my nails shine after the application with just gentle buffing.</li>
    <li> Medical problems have caused my nails to peel, so my dermatologist told me to use rubber gloves whenever I washed dishes or clothes, and to start using DermaNail.  He warned me that I wouldn&#x27;t see results for at least 6 weeks, and he was right about that.  It worked very well the first 6 months that I used it,so I stopped using it. That was a mistake. I started reusing it, and now my nails don&#x27;t seem as protected as they did when I used DermaNail before.  However, the current state of my nails could be due to changes in medication.  Since it did such a good job the first time, and my nails aren&#x27;t great, but they are better than without using the DermaNail, so I&#x27;d encourage anyone with nail problems to give it a try.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about nine weeks, and can now say that it is well worth all of the effort.  Application of the product is a little annoying, in that there is no brush but instead a thin rod. In addition, you must put it on and wait an hour before washing your hands. I do it in the morning after I feed my dog and before I take a shower, and then in the evening after I get into bed.  I was just starting to despair that it would work but then really noticed an improvement.  I am almost at the point where it would not seem a waste of money to get a manicure, which is really saying something. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had no problem with receiving it. Its exactly what I ordered. I&#x27;m using this product on my feet for brittle and cracking nails. It was recommended to me by a dermatologist. It just takes time to see the results.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product.  My dermatologist said it would be helpful but not magic.  Te directions tell you to be patient; can take 6 wks to see improvement. Now I am really happy with the results? My nails are smoother and longer than they&#x27;ve ever been.  However, I have to keep doing the treatments to maintain the results.</li>
    <li> Using DermaNail for 6weeks.  Not much improvement so far. Hope it works into the future.</li>
    <li> I have had brittle, split nails for years and nothing has helped.  It took 4 months but by nails have stopped splitting and are stronger.  I used Dermanail in conjunction with Cutemol as advised.</li>
    <li> I have used Dermanail for several years and it is the only product that grows a healthy nail for me. And I have tried them all.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I have ever found that will strengthen  my fingernails.  This was first prescribed by a dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I like Dermanail and have been using i for two or three years.  Without Dermanail my nails are very weak and crack and chip.  I have recommended Dermanail to my friends.</li>
    <li> I have used Summers Lab DermaNail Conditioner for years. It was the only product that repared my brittle nails time and time again. It was recommended by my dermatologist and it works! I usually see the results after about a month of using it, and once the nails are repaired they remain strong and beautiful for a very long time. Unfortunately, my tendency to have my nails &amp;#34;crash&amp;#34; occasionaly is still there, but nowhere near as frequently as before I started using this conditioner. And now I don&#x27;t despair over the state of my nails, I just order another bottle of this product and know that in relatively short time (from 1 to 3 months) my nails will be strong again. By the way, one bottle lasts a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;I have nothing but praise for this product, and hope it will always be available for my nail emergencies.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist as i had a nail that breaks straight across at the bed. Also a vertical ridge that makes the nail break in one section.  I used the product for several weeks and noticed that on the finger right beside the nail, I had developed dry flaky skin.  I kept using it and one morning woke up with a swollen red finger.  I had developed an infection in that spot.  I discontinued using the product and have been afraid of using it ever since.  There was a tube of Cutemol with it that I have just started using.  Perhaps I should have been using that all along, but as the one reviewer says, Who has time for all these applications.  We shall see how the Cutmol does.</li>
    <li> Works as expected with time</li>
    <li> I see an improvement, but nothing amazing. My nails still peel.  I use it regularly along with a cuticle cream twice a day. I was hoping to stop the peeling so my nails would grow longer, but I&#x27;m not getting results that others are claiming.  Even supplementing with biotin didn&#x27;t help. I&#x27;m on my third bottle...I keep hoping...</li>
    <li> I have been using Dermanail and Cutemol since November 2012 and I can&#x27;t believe the difference in my nails.  I have tried so many products in the past and nothing has cured my peeling nails like Dermanail.  My nails are now long, strong and dont peel!  I will be a forever customer as long as it is available to customers!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had problem fingernails for years, and they often split at the edge. When my dermatologist suggested this, I had my doubts. But it really works. You apply it to the growing edge at the back of the nail, so it takes a while for the nail to grow out and the effect to be seen, so you have to be patient. It comes with a moisturizer cream called Cutmol, which is apparently included as a sample, and some people who have written reviews here apparently think using that cream is required. I&#x27;ve never used the cream. Only the DermaNail. And that worked for me. I&#x27;m in my 70s. I won&#x27;t say this made my nails like a 20-year-old. But the splitting is greatly improved.</li>
    <li> The first bottle from Drug store site seems to have worked better than this bottle.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for a few weeks. I see a difference in my nails. They are much stronger &amp; not splitting.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist for my splitting nails.  I have only been using it a few weeks and the directions say to be patient as it takes 16 weeks to see results.  It is easy to apply and dries quickly.  There is no unpleasant smell and it leaves a slight gloss on your nails.  I intend to keep using it until the bottle is used up and if I see improvement I will order again.  In the time I have been using it the bottle has gone down very little, so I expect it to last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - I have been using this product for 5 months now and it has done everything it promised.  I have been using it along with Elon Nail Conditioner as recommended by my dermatologist.  My nails have grown out and there are no more cracks and splits.  They are very hard and strong.  I use it every morning and night as directed and still have about 1/3 of the bottle left, so even though it seems expensive it lasts a very long time.  I am very pleased with this product and intend to continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I am having some dry nail issues and this was prescribed by my dermatologist.  I nails are improving, but I still am having issues.  Could possibly be other health problems.</li>
    <li> I started using this product conscientiously shortly before Christmas and now in the middle of May, I&#x27;m still waiting to see results.  If anything, my nails have gotton worse due to the drying properties of the 82% alcohol in DermaNail.  I feel like an idiot for being duped by the claims the manufacturer of this product made.  It&#x27;s not a cheap experiment.  I&#x27;ve used every product that I&#x27;ve run across including large doses if biotin and all sorts if nail  &amp;#34;hardeners&amp;#34; and nothing has helped.  I&#x27;m convinced good nails are a product of good genes and there isn&#x27;t much that can be done to overcome the lack thereof.  I don&#x27;t understand how a person can have great hair but terrible nails.</li>
