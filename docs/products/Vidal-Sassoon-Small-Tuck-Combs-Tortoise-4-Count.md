      <li>Good price and gray service</li>
      <li>So glad they&#x27;re here on Amazon!</li>
      <li>so I am thrilled to find them here.  </li>
      <li>The teeth of these combs break very easily.</li>
      <li>It might just be my hair, which is very fine, but I couldn&#x27;t get these to stay put.  </li>
      <li>They won&#x27;t stay in my hair, even though I have very fine hair.  </li>
      <li>LOVE THESE FOR MY VINTAGE LOOKS.</li>
      <li>CUTE SIZE,</li>
      <li>GLAD</li>
      <li>They are a good value and hold my baby fine hair very well.</li>
      <li>they really work well on fine hair and are good quality.</li>
      <li>If you have fine hair, these work well.  </li>
      <li>The  set work fine, they attach to hair, they are just what a tuck comb doctor would order</li>
      <li>But these are quite flimsy, - the teeth are too flexible, and the plastic too cheap.  </li>
      <li>Not so great when I want to pull it back, and those elastic headband</li>
      <li>These combs have light hold.  </li>
      <li>I thought I ordered bigger ones myself but am happy with the size now that I have it.</li>
      <li>As I got older and my hair thinned, I needed a smaller comb, and this is perfect.  </li>
      <li>The price was good, but I don&#x27;t really have any use for them because they are too large for what I wanted them for.</li>
      <li>exactly as described and they hold my fine hair well.</li>
      <li>I have lots of layers in my hair which is great when it&#x27;s down.  </li>
      <li>These are a fantastic alternative, and I haven&#x27;t been able to find them in my local stores.  </li>
      <li>The combs are very nice little combs.</li>
      <li>I use them to pull back my super fine hair on each side and secure it from falling in my face.  </li>
      <li>- it gave her the right amount of &#x27;lift&#x27; to the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My hair is quite fine and not thick.  </li>
      <li>She liked using these combs instead of a bobby pin in certain key areas of her up-do</li>
      <li>Very small and great for shorter hair.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;d also be great for kids, but if you have normal to thick hair</li>
      <li>it feels flimsy, I can see it working in a baby or toddler&#x27;s hair, in VERY fine hair, or in an up-do (along with other bobby pins and combs).  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see these working very well or holding a lot of hair.</li>
      <li>Thanks for carrying them.</li>
      <li>and it was really 1x2x.02.</li>
      <li>They seem very sturdy since I wear them a lot</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon / Vidal Sassoon for still carrying them</li>
      <li>Thanks for having them on line...</li>
      <li>I buy regular sized combs and cut them in half to get the size I want, so I was thrilled when I saw these!  </li>
      <li>Always comes in handy for a little lift!</li>
      <li>It was nice to find these small combs ...</li>
      <li>I also bought medium combs and they seem to  work a little better.</li>
      <li>Two of the combs&#x27; teeth easily broke (one out of the package and the other after I tried it in my hair).</li>
      <li>if a normal size bobby pin would work for you, then one of these combs would replace one bobby pin.  </li>
      <li>In reading all the other posts, some complained that this comb does not hold enough hair; others say it is perfect.  </li>
      <li>I used to wear these every day years ago, and decided to get some new ones.</li>
      <li>cheap, not worth it, the teeth are already breaking off.</li>
      <li>I have short, thin hair and these work great to hold my hair back.</li>
      <li>I had my old batch for years.  </li>
      <li>I do okay with other combs, wanted these because they are small, but really can&#x27;t use them.</li>
      <li>What I didn&#x27;t realize, and the reason I&#x27;m only giving 3 stars, is that the teeth are not very long, so these will not hold your hair very well at all.  </li>
      <li>Hard plastic, pokey, itchy, doesn&#x27;t go into the hair easy or come out</li>
      <li>I have very thick, curly hair and there is no way these would fit in my hair but will hopefully work out well for the person I am giving them to!</li>
      <li>I wore my hair super short for last few years and now that it&#x27;s growing out I need the combs again.  </li>
      <li>I had some small combs like these in the past and really liked them.  </li>
      <li>Just be aware of the size only being an inch wide and .5 of an inch long.</li>
      <li>They fall out of my hair easily, and two of them have already broken.  </li>
      <li>IF YOU HAVE THIN FINE HAIR.</li>

<li> Very small (like tiny) and flimsy.</li>
<li> growing out my hair and these little combs keep it out of my way.  </li>
<li> Misplaced them over time, but none ever broke.  </li>
<li> instead, these are a waste of money.</li>
<li> I bought these as a gift and they are the tiniest little combs!</li>
<li> These are particularly small.</li>
<li> But if one bobby pin wouldn&#x27;t hold your hair sufficiently, then this comb will be too small and flimsy for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
<li> comb is small - around 1 3/4\\&quot;</li>
<li> These are quite small.</li>
<li> Too small to hold my hair in place.  </li>
<li> They are too small</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not able to go through the thickness of your hair to anchor it snugly.</li>
<li> Way to small, gave to granddaughter for the baby dolls.</li>
<li> I dislike this product because it&#x27;s too small for why I bought them.</li>
<li> She uses bobby pins (at least 15-20 of them) to hold her hair in place.  </li>
<li> hairdresser says I don&#x27;t have thick hair</li>
<li> I like this product because it&#x27;s very small</li>
<li> This size is hard to find!  </li>
<li> These small tuck combs are difficult to find.</li>
<li> With really thin hair it has been difficult to find combs that work.  </li>
<li> My Mom has a very small frame and loves the mini combs but they are close to impossible to find.  </li>
<li> The design is flawed and they won&#x27;t stay in my hair.</li>
<li> Combs were a disappointment.  </li>
<li> I used to find them at the drugstore, Target, etc.; they are now impossible to find at stores</li>
<li> These combs are worthless.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I buy regular sized combs and cut them in half to get the size I want, so I was thrilled when I saw these!  This is also my preferred color, so I purchased several pairs.  What I didn&#x27;t realize, and the reason I&#x27;m only giving 3 stars, is that the teeth are not very long, so these will not hold your hair very well at all.  I have thin, fine hair and only want to hold the sides up a bit; unfortunately, these will not do the job.</li>
    <li> These are particularly small. Just what I needed!</li>
    <li> They were and are to short to get a proper hold with.</li>
    <li> cheap, not worth it, the teeth are already breaking off.</li>
    <li> These small tuck combs are difficult to find.</li>
    <li> Combs were a disappointment.  They are too small I guess. They won&#x27;t stay in my hair, even though I have very fine hair.  I also bought medium combs and they seem to  work a little better.</li>
    <li> The product description is &amp;#34;Product Dimensions:  3.5 x 4.5 x 0.2 inches &amp;#34;, these combs are NOT this size!  The individual combs measure 1 3/4&amp;#34; x 1&amp;#34;.  Instead of &amp;#34;small tuck combs&amp;#34; it should read &amp;#34;tiny tuck combs&amp;#34;.  Returning for a refund.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re functional but way smaller than I thought.</li>
    <li> I bought these as a gift and they are the tiniest little combs! I have very thick, curly hair and there is no way these would fit in my hair but will hopefully work out well for the person I am giving them to!</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because I read the product dimensions and it was stated 3.5x4.5x0.2 and it was really 1x2x.02. I dislike this product because it&#x27;s too small for why I bought them. I like this product because it&#x27;s very small and you can use it to tuck stray hairs in and they are not seen. I would not recommend this product until there is truth in advertising of product dimensions.</li>
    <li> Very nice combs. Good price and gray service</li>
    <li> What can you say about this comb. The  set work fine, they attach to hair, they are just what a tuck comb doctor would order</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t listed in the sale offering, but these are about 1.5\\&quot;  inches wide. Too small to hold my hair in place.  I like the color but I need a wider comb.</li>
    <li> I have lots of layers in my hair which is great when it&#x27;s down.  Not so great when I want to pull it back, and those elastic headband things give me a headache.  These are a fantastic alternative, and I haven&#x27;t been able to find them in my local stores.  So glad they&#x27;re here on Amazon!</li>
    <li> exactly as described and they hold my fine hair well.</li>
    <li> Finally found these and the side combs I have been searching for... With really thin hair it has been difficult to find combs that work.  Thanks for having them on line...</li>
    <li> The teeth of these combs break very easily.</li>
    <li> Great.  This size is hard to find!  Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> They are very nice. Just be aware of the size only being an inch wide and .5 of an inch long. I thought I ordered bigger ones myself but am happy with the size now that I have it. They seem very sturdy since I wear them a lot and they are still in too condition.</li>
    <li> The combs are very nice little combs. They are perfect for the area that I use them in my Hair</li>
    <li> In reading all the other posts, some complained that this comb does not hold enough hair; others say it is perfect.  So I didn&#x27;t know if it would work for me - it doesn&#x27;t, but it does work for my mother!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comb is small - around 1 3/4\\&quot; x 7/8\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is too flimsy for my hair - I use the Vidal Sassoon Medium sized combs, and they work for my hair.  I was going to use this in a smaller section of hair, but it didn&#x27;t hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother, on the other hand, wears her hair in an &#x27;up-do&#x27;.  She uses bobby pins (at least 15-20 of them) to hold her hair in place.  She liked using these combs instead of a bobby pin in certain key areas of her up-do - it gave her the right amount of &#x27;lift&#x27; to the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the moral of the story - if a normal size bobby pin would work for you, then one of these combs would replace one bobby pin.  But if one bobby pin wouldn&#x27;t hold your hair sufficiently, then this comb will be too small and flimsy for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it feels flimsy, I can see it working in a baby or toddler&#x27;s hair, in VERY fine hair, or in an up-do (along with other bobby pins and combs).  But for everyone else, I would probably suggest the medium size instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this is helpful to you...</li>
    <li> I had some small combs like these in the past and really liked them.  Thought these would be the same.  But these are quite flimsy, - the teeth are too flexible, and the plastic too cheap.  They fall out of my hair easily, and two of them have already broken.  I had my old batch for years.  Misplaced them over time, but none ever broke.  My hair is quite fine and not thick.  These should have worked well for me.  Granted, they are not expensive, but if they are this useless, then that changes.  I would not buy this brand again in the tuck combs.</li>
    <li> IF YOU HAVE THIN FINE HAIR. THESE COMBS ARE PERFECT. THEY STAY WHERE YOU PUT THEM. THE COLOR AND QUALITY ARE GOOD</li>
    <li> Hard plastic, pokey, itchy, doesn&#x27;t go into the hair easy or come out easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hairdresser says I don&#x27;t have thick hair but I have a lot of it, these do not work at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get Goody instead, these are a waste of money.</li>
    <li> LOVE THESE FOR MY VINTAGE LOOKS. MATCHES MY RED HAIR WELL. CUTE SIZE, GLAD THEY&#x27;RE NOT TOO BIG.</li>
    <li> It will not hold even the smallest amount of hair back.  It&#x27;s not able to go through the thickness of your hair to anchor it snugly.</li>
    <li> Very small (like tiny) and flimsy. Two of the combs&#x27; teeth easily broke (one out of the package and the other after I tried it in my hair). Not worth the order.</li>
    <li> My Mom has a very small frame and loves the mini combs but they are close to impossible to find.  Thanks Amazon / Vidal Sassoon for still carrying them - she uses them on a daily basis!</li>
    <li> I used these over twenty years ago when I had longer, almost shoulder length hair.  I wore my hair super short for last few years and now that it&#x27;s growing out I need the combs again.  I used to find them at the drugstore, Target, etc.; they are now impossible to find at stores so I am thrilled to find them here.  If you have fine hair, these work well.  I use them to pull back my super fine hair on each side and secure it from falling in my face.  These combs have light hold.  I&#x27;m stocking up again.  Thanks for carrying them.</li>
    <li> It might just be my hair, which is very fine, but I couldn&#x27;t get these to stay put.  I do okay with other combs, wanted these because they are small, but really can&#x27;t use them.</li>
    <li> Way to small, gave to granddaughter for the baby dolls.</li>
    <li> I wish amazon would post the actual measurements of these. These are almost 2&amp;#34; long and 1&amp;#34; wide, much larger than I expected. I thought they were going to be about 1-1.5&amp;#34; wide. The price was good, but I don&#x27;t really have any use for them because they are too large for what I wanted them for.</li>
    <li> I wish the size of the comb had been stated.  These are quite small.</li>
    <li> As I got older and my hair thinned, I needed a smaller comb, and this is perfect.  They are shaped in such a way that they go into the hair without tugging and hold the hair in place all day.</li>
    <li> Always comes in handy for a little lift!</li>
    <li> Some other reviewers noted the small size of these and that&#x27;s actually why I bought them. I have short, thin hair and these work great to hold my hair back. They&#x27;d also be great for kids, but if you have normal to thick hair I don&#x27;t see these working very well or holding a lot of hair.</li>
    <li> It was nice to find these small combs ... they really work well on fine hair and are good quality.</li>
    <li> I used to wear these every day years ago, and decided to get some new ones. Couldn&#x27;t find them in any stores anywhere, so when I saw them offered as an &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34; I immediately ordered!  They are perfect! Very small and great for shorter hair. Thank you.</li>
    <li> growing out my hair and these little combs keep it out of my way.  They are a good value and hold my baby fine hair very well.</li>
    <li> These combs are worthless.  The design is flawed and they won&#x27;t stay in my hair. I wish I could the ones I used to buy years ago.</li>
