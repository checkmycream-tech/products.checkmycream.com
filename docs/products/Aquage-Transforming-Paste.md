      <li>This product is FAR superior.</li>
      <li>Pretty incredible hair product that was first brought to my attention by a professional hairdresser.</li>

      <li>The right product</li>
      <li>the best&lt;br /&gt;I will order it for sure net time from you guys</li>
      <li>Fast Shipping!</li>
      <li>Everyday is a good hair day with this product.</li>
      <li>My new favorite by far.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve tried countless others--this is by far my FAVORITE!</li>
      <li>Coming from a guy who prefers an easy and natural look, and who prior to this point had never \\&quot;done\\&quot; my hair every morning before leaving the house, the Aquage Transforming Paste is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t make me look like I&#x27;ve lathered myself all over with gel, or like a grease ball.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only hair product I have found that holds my hair nicely, isn&#x27;t greasy, looks natural and never crusty.  </li>
      <li>I have long spike hair, so this product was able to hold my hair up, but the oily feeling that I got on my hair</li>
      <li>Easy to use and gives hair a natural and soft look</li>
      <li>They have a tiny travel size that is a ripoff, and a huge one that is cumbersome.</li>
      <li>I have made the mistake of putting too much in and having a clump or two in my hair</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I have saved this seller&#x27;s name and will order from them again, fast delivery</li>
      <li>I can really make it look like the hairdresser just styled it.</li>
      <li>I found that your service was was a much faster way to recieve the Aquage.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much so it lasts forever.  </li>
      <li>I did use too much one time, it is greasy when that happens.  </li>
      <li>Being that it&#x27;s water based, you can also easily just wet your hands and give it a touch up throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>last comment:  If you are guy, wife or girlfriend deciding between this and any of the Axe products, lucky for you</li>
      <li>I think it is the same price, just comes in a more basic tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry into a hard crust like many pastes and give you the most extreme control available.</li>
      <li>The best paste ever, but very difficult to find at the major drug stores or beauty supply places.</li>
      <li>I still have my old dispenser for a few more uses</li>
      <li>After your dried your hair, put wax on your hair and style to your liking first, then squeeze out like an inch worth of paste and rub it around your fingers, then applies it on your hair to pull out and define the shapes or styles you want.     </li>
      <li>If you want your hair straight and slicked back probably not the product for you.</li>
      <li>It was time for me to have a professional hair style, and this is what the girl who cuts my hair told me to use.  </li>
      <li>but, wow it does work well.</li>
      <li>ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many other brands of hair product since then, but I always come back to this simply because nothing is better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>for)---it lasts all day and most importantly never makes my hair greasy like other molding</li>
      <li>Worth the price, since you use so little.</li>
      <li>I use it after I wash and dry my hair--just a little bit that I rub between my hands and lightly put on my hair to &#x27;separate&#x27; it.</li>
      <li>This product will give you a very good hold but not great if you are getting wet (rain, excessive sweat, swimming) but gets the job done.</li>
      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s not a bad product, but for $18, it is pretty expensive...</li>

<li> I have thick straight short hair.  </li>
<li> , you need such a small amount to style, the bottle will last for years!</li>
<li> I look professional and kept without looking like I am trying all that hard to achieve it.  </li>
<li> Product is exellant and it arrived in just a few short days!!!</li>
<li> my hair is naturally curly and thick and  I&#x27;ve had all types of hairstyles--short and spiky, curly, all lengths, layered, bobs, etc.</li>
<li> husband loves this stuff as a dry gel only need to use very little to get desired results</li>
<li> so a little does go a long way.</li>
<li> Usually just a tiny dot on the tips of my fingers and rubbing together before I rake through my hair does the job.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Perfect level of tackiness for finishing hair styles</li>
    <li> Love this styling paste! It helps me style my hard to manage hair and it leaves it shiny. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love this product, have been using it for years.  And a good buy.  I like the pump more than the tube, even though they say you get 25% more.  Will continue buying from this company.</li>
    <li> It was time for me to have a professional hair style, and this is what the girl who cuts my hair told me to use.

I look professional and kept without looking like I am trying all that hard to achieve it.  Bingo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do use this stuff every day, save yourself the money and buy the 4.6 fl. oz. size.  I think it is the same price, just comes in a more basic tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last comment:  If you are guy, wife or girlfriend deciding between this and any of the Axe products, lucky for you, your search ends here.  This product is FAR superior.</li>
    <li> I remembered reading a review from another user stating that this product put a shin or gloss over your hair, but I couldn&#x27;t find that review anymore, but I have to agree the reviewer.   By only using the Aquage Transforming paste only, your hair would look glossy, or to me, I felt it&#x27;s the shine that you haven&#x27;t washed your hair for couple days.     About it&#x27;s holding power, when you squeeze and rub it between your hand, you can feel the stickiness of it, it is like mixture of hairspary+wax as someone described it.     Scent: personally I didn&#x27;t like it as much, but it is not strong type of scent.     Styling:  I have long spike hair, so this product was able to hold my hair up, but the oily feeling that I got on my hair, I didn&#x27;t really enjoy it.      What I would recommended others do:  After your dried your hair, put wax on your hair and style to your liking first, then squeeze out like an inch worth of paste and rub it around your fingers, then applies it on your hair to pull out and define the shapes or styles you want.     Overall, it&#x27;s not a bad product, but for $18, it is pretty expensive...</li>
    <li> Started using this stuff after a salon owner recommended it to me years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many other brands of hair product since then, but I always come back to this simply because nothing is better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very sticky paste when you pump it out onto your palm, but dissolves effortlessly into moist hair.  Firms into a nice, matte coat that doesn&#x27;t give off that gel/mousse sheen.  Very easy to style, holds well, washes out easily.  Perfect.</li>
    <li> Holds my hair great.  Great service. Quick delivery.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Have used this for years. Works great.</li>
    <li> Great hair product.Not greasy or flaky.</li>
    <li> My wife likes the hold this stuff gives to her hair, and she gets many compliments!!</li>
    <li> I had such a hard time finding this product, even Aquage&#x27;s home page was out of stock so I was very thrilled to find this and I bought 2 of these.  If you have short hair and like to spike it, this is the stuff for you.  I have found nothing that works as well or even close.  I have saved this seller&#x27;s name and will order from them again, fast delivery, no complaints!!</li>
    <li> Great product to make hair appear thicker and wavier. If you want your hair straight and slicked back probably not the product for you. I have longer hair on top that is wavy, I try and go for the Bradley Cooper look. This product will give you a very good hold but not great if you are getting wet (rain, excessive sweat, swimming) but gets the job done. My new favorite by far.</li>
    <li> If you want a hair product to do \\&quot;bed head\\&quot; then this is the best product I&#x27;ve ever tried. It doesn&#x27;t dry into a hard crust like many pastes and give you the most extreme control available. I&#x27;ve used it non-stop for a period of years and have very healthy hair so it is a healthy product to use for your hair.</li>
    <li> I got turned onto this stuff back in college and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.  It&#x27;s the only hair product I have found that holds my hair nicely, isn&#x27;t greasy, looks natural and never crusty.  Being that it&#x27;s water based, you can also easily just wet your hands and give it a touch up throughout the day.  I&#x27;m so glad Amazon carries this as I cannot find it anywhere.  I hope they never stop making this stuff.  I recommend buying the pump version as it makes it really easy to get the perfect amount on your hand.</li>
    <li> This is the Most Awesome Product that you can not find in any of your Salons !! Please Never take it off the Market....</li>
    <li> I keep reordering this.  Everyday is a good hair day with this product.</li>
    <li> As I explained, the pump is too hard for my arthritis.  I bought opened one, i am unable to return so I am stuck with this expensive Aquage Paste.  I would like to return the one that was not opened. What do I need to do.  I will never buy anything in regards to Aquage</li>
    <li> The tiniest amount will make your style behave.  Rub between your palms and smooth onto hair.  If I get a stray going the wrong way, a little of this on the ends of my hair and using a round brush to shape fixes it for the day.  I did use too much one time, it is greasy when that happens.  Usually just a tiny dot on the tips of my fingers and rubbing together before I rake through my hair does the job.  No smell and great shine.  I love this!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a great styling aid, this is it!  Doesn&#x27;t take much so it lasts forever.  Very easy to work with.</li>
    <li> Product is exellant and it arrived in just a few short days!!! I&#x27;ve used this product for years now and I never get tired of it!!! Its perfect!!</li>
    <li> Not a happy camper...the product pictured is NOT the product that was delivered.  If I wanted the Aquage in a tube, I would have ordered that...I received two tubes.  I still have my old dispenser for a few more uses so I have not used the product delivered.  Again, my contention is that I ordered the product with a specific dispenser, like the picture shown and received something else...even though it is named as the same product.</li>
    <li> The only way that I can purchase this product is on line. I purchased it from sleekhair.com prior to makeing this purchase. I found that your service was was a much faster way to recieve the Aquage. I received it 2 day after I ordered it. GREAT SERVICE!!!Thanks</li>
    <li> The pump action on this is horrible.  I like the product, but wish they made in in a smaller tube.  They have a tiny travel size that is a ripoff, and a huge one that is cumbersome.</li>
    <li> Great deal. Fast Shipping!</li>
    <li> Love this!  I use it after I wash and dry my hair--just a little bit that I rub between my hands and lightly put on my hair to &#x27;separate&#x27; it.</li>
    <li> I have thick straight short hair.  This product is perfect to use after blowing my hair dry.  I can really make it look like the hairdresser just styled it.</li>
    <li> The best hair paste I have ever used.  Allows for easy styling. Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on your hair and takes very little product for each use. About the size of a pea is all you have to use.</li>
    <li> I was looking for the product in the pump bottle as shown and it is always sent in tube form. This is very decieving and should not be allowed to be photographed in the wrong container. I would not have ordered if I knew it was coming in tube form. It is very hard to use product packaged this way!!!</li>
    <li> Best hair product I have ever used.  Easy to use and gives hair a natural and soft look but with strong hold.</li>
    <li> Great product and great price! I will definitely buy again!!</li>
    <li> Aquage was recommended to me and I am very satisfied with the product and how it works.  I would recommend this hair product to friends.</li>
    <li> My hair has a mind of its own.  I put it in its place with Aquage and it doesn&#x27;t look overdone.  Then rinse my hands easily.  Used it for years.</li>
    <li> Perfect paste to creat texture. You can dampen your hair later in the day a touch up your hair. A little oes a long way!</li>
    <li> I have used Aquage for 8 years to keep my thin hair in place. It&#x27;s not greasy and looks great for the whole day.</li>
    <li> I love aquage products.  I use this full-size and the travel-size all of the time.  It takes a few seconds to bring my hair to life and very fashionable.</li>
    <li> Pretty incredible hair product that was first brought to my attention by a professional hairdresser. Just a small amount (the size of a bb) in your hair enables you to finish your \\&quot;do\\&quot; in any number of ways. Adds texture, firm hold, unscented. Worth the price, since you use so little.</li>
    <li> This is bar far the best hair product I have ever used. Been using it for years and would&lt;br /&gt;never switch to any other product.</li>
    <li> Great hold even on humid days. Very subtle fragrance. I am sensitive to some scents but this product is perfect.</li>
    <li> The wrong size was sent.  The right product so I kept it.  I have used this product for years.  Thanks</li>
    <li> The best paste ever, but very difficult to find at the major drug stores or beauty supply places. Where is the distribution?</li>
    <li> I will warn you it is very thick so a little does go a long way. I have made the mistake of putting too much in and having a clump or two in my hair but, wow it does work well. I would say the size of a dime is enough for me and my hair is thick for a guy. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Lovey this stuff.  Not too greasy and does not make it feel like your hair is clumped together.  Very light and awesome.</li>
    <li> This product is used by my hairdresser.  I couldn&#x27;t find it in any of the stores here, so ordered it, and will contine to use this non greasy product.  It does work wonders with my hair as short as it is!</li>
    <li> I own a box of hair supplies and I&#x27;ve tried countless others--this is by far my FAVORITE! my hair is naturally curly and thick and  I&#x27;ve had all types of hairstyles--short and spiky, curly, all lengths, layered, bobs, etc. This paste is perfect for adding volume and body (what i use it for)---it lasts all day and most importantly never makes my hair greasy like other molding waxes.&lt;br /&gt;Also, you need such a small amount to style, the bottle will last for years!</li>
    <li> Great product. Just use a small dab for short hair to style. Scrunck your hair to get a messy or spicky look.</li>
    <li> husband loves this stuff as a dry gel only need to use very little to get desired results</li>
    <li> the best&lt;br /&gt;I will order it for sure net time from you guys keep it in stock it is a great product</li>
    <li> Only takes a bit.. Great product</li>
