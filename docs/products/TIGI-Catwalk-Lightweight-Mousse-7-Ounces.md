      <li>It even makes my fine hair appear more thick.  </li>
      <li>I like VOLUME in my curls and this product didn&#x27;t really give me that.</li>
      <li>I have to think the women posting that they had build up with it were using WAY too much.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Only 4 stars because Amazon does not offer the lightweight mousse in the Amazon Prime, only the Strong Mousse, which I cannot use.</li>
      <li>I have fine, curly hair, and have always searched for products to hold my curls without being stiff...</li>
      <li>Perhaps its old?</li>
      <li>, I miss my curls and want to know if this product will help me to look a soft and natural curls</li>

      <li>The first few days I used this mousse</li>
      <li>My hair is thick and long with loose ringlets, and I started getting many complements while using this product.  </li>

<li> Very very hard to find this product.</li>

<li> This mousse worked weird for me.</li>
<li> not to mention my curls were rock hard :(</li>

    <li> I would hate to see what a regular or stiff mousse would be, this is hardly light.  Hair is left very stiff.  Has to be washed out.  Hoping for a little help with holding soft curls but curls felt like toothpicks.  Don&#x27;t waste your money if  your are truly wanting something lightweight.</li>
    <li> This mousse takes my hair from frizzed-out chia pet to perfectly defined curls. I can&#x27;t even count how many compliments I&#x27;ve received on my hair since starting to use this product. I would definitely recommend this to any gal with unmanageable curls.</li>
    <li> Quick receipt of great item. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I was buying this product in a salon, and when I started running out, I decided to save myself a trip across town and get it on Amazon.  I have permed hair.  I apply the mousse after my hair has been towel dried.  I use a [[ASIN:B0051E3840 Conair Pop Hair Pick]]to pull the curls up in my hair, then I let it dry.  After it is dried, I use the pick to pull the curls out even further.  It is not noticeable after my hair has been dried and styled, and it leaves my curls with a silky texture.</li>
    <li> I agree that this \\&quot;lightweight\\&quot; is on the stronger side, but it in no way left my hair like \\&quot;toothpicks\\&quot;.  I have long, wavy hair that is not thick and this was a great product for me.  I found that the frizz was under control and I had soft, beautiful curls.  Will buy it again!</li>
    <li> I have used this lightweight mousse for several years. I found your prices cheaper than I had been paying. I like having it delivered to my door. I don&#x27;t have to get out in this Arizona heat.</li>
    <li> My daughter-in-law uses this for her baby fine hair.  It gives just enough hold without weighing it down.  I use the TIGI strong mousse for my hard to curl hair and it&#x27;s the only product that has ever worked well for me.  This stuff is expensive on Amazon and sometimes I can find it for 30% less at TJ Maxx.  When they have it, I buy plenty of both formulas.  Both products are absolutely amazing!  Best money I&#x27;ve ever spent on a hair product.  It changed my life!</li>
    <li> is the first time I will use this product and my question is this I have my very dry and damaged hair and I have struggled to find a product to help me with my frizzy and dry hair, I miss my curls and want to know if this product will help me to look a soft and natural curls</li>
    <li> Not as effective as before. Perhaps its old?</li>
    <li> Am so glad to find this ... it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> Not a problem with the product..........but for me.....if you have short thinning hair and want beautiful easy curl .....this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> Best way to order so many products. It arrived on time and still the same awesome product. Will always order this way.</li>
    <li> PROS:  My curls are very weak (barely curly hair.)  Usually, curl products either emphasize a curl but leave my hair stiff and crunchy, or they are too glossy/moisturizing and weigh my curls down.  This is what I&#x27;ve been searching for.  It&#x27;s my holy grail hair product.  I get definition and a bit of smoothing effect, while making my curls more \\&quot;curly.\\&quot;  It even makes my fine hair appear more thick.  Smell is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:  Not the cheapest in the world, but there are much more expensive products too.  I could see how this would weigh someone&#x27;s hair down if they didn&#x27;t use it sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;APPLICATION TIPS:  I was using \\&quot;Spray it Curly\\&quot; by itself.  I now use the Spray it Curly sprayed into my hand to scrunch my ends with.  I then take this and put a small amount at a time into my hands and work some into my root area (and some mid-shaft too).  I could see using this a bit on my ends too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PURCHASING TIPS:  I get this at a better price through amazon.</li>
    <li> This mousse worked weird for me. It was lightweight, it didn&#x27;t make my hair stiff...but it also didn&#x27;t hold my curls in well at all and made my hair appear greasy and odd textured all day. I like VOLUME in my curls and this product didn&#x27;t really give me that. It isn&#x27;t a bad product by any means. I adore the smell and the rest of the Curlesque collection, I just don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I bought my first bottle of this in September of 2012. It is now March of 2013 and I am JUST running out. I can&#x27;t believe it lasted that long. I do not use a lot of it. Maybe a half-dollar size in my hand, rub them together and scrunch in my hair.I have to think the women posting that they had build up with it were using WAY too much. I have noticed my hair is only crunchy when I accidentally use too much of it or don&#x27;t get it evenly distributed through my hair. Otherwise, I can&#x27;t think of any problems with this mousse.  It beats out everything else I have tried. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> For those with truly curly, not just wavy hair, this is the product line you have been looking for!  It will leave your curls defined yet silky and shiny.  My hair is thick and long with loose ringlets, and I started getting many complements while using this product.  Great for summer as it fights frizz, and gentle enough that it keeps hair hydrated and glossy during the winter.</li>
    <li> It is a great product as it is lightweight and I have thin hair... works perfect... a must to&lt;br /&gt;try if you have thinner hair</li>
    <li> I have been searching for the perfect mousse for my curly hair for years.  The first few days I used this mousse I thought I had found it; it was lightweight and my curls looked fantastic without frizz.  After day four I realized that there was quite a lot of residue build up, so the next day I washed my hair twice, but to no avail.  I still haven&#x27;t been able to get it all out and I&#x27;ve been washing my hair at least 2 times for the last 3-4 days.</li>
    <li> product is genuine, and fast ship!</li>
    <li> I have fine, curly hair, and have always searched for products to hold my curls without being stiff... I finally found the product! (I had even tried the Curlesque heavier mousse... nope!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product gives me great, natural-looking curls that last for days! (I often take naps, and my hair looks great afterward!) I have never been so pleased with hair products!</li>
    <li> Great soft curl mouse.  Used it for years.</li>
    <li> Great for curly hair or even hair u are going to curl! it is a very good product for cheap</li>
    <li> I can not get this stuff out of my hair. I accidentally bought the light version instead of the intended strong.</li>
    <li> Love this product will be ordering more.  I have thick curly hair and this keeps it from being super frizzy.</li>
    <li> Very very hard to find this product. Love love love this Lightweight Mousse. Only 4 stars because Amazon does not offer the lightweight mousse in the Amazon Prime, only the Strong Mousse, which I cannot use. I have been using this product for years and its the best and only line of products I will use on my curly hair. Just wish it was on the prime program.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years, since I cut my fine hair short. The lightweight mousse is much stronger than their strong mousse . it&#x27;s odd but thats the way they work.  I&#x27;m sure if people who wear their hair spiked up knew this they would buy the lightweight instead of the strong&lt;br /&gt; Curlesque Moussse. It&#x27;s a great strong mousse.</li>
    <li> i cant get this stuff out of my hair.... i washed my hair 4 times and then went to the salon, the girl there washed it 3 times and still my roots are stuck together..... not to mention my curls were rock hard :(</li>
