<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I originally tried this on a cruise.  I absolutely love the feel of it and what it does for my skin.  I would never buy it again on a cruise, this is now my go to company.  I received the product in a timely manner at a very fair price!</li>
    <li> Very gentle and perfect under makeup.</li>
    <li> Nice cream especially for dry climates</li>
    <li> The best moisturizer that I have ever used.  I was first introduced to this product on a cruise ship and began to look for a cheaper price.  I found it here!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Feels great!  Works Great!</li>
    <li> Perfect, not too heavy weight, and spreads easily. After using this product for a week, my friends and family asked what I was doing differently with my skin. Evens tone and diminishes lines. I highly recommend using the apricot toner with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Elemis for ten years. Good skin care products are a great investment. You can search online to determine the right products for your skin. Buy from Amazon they have the best prices!</li>
    <li> This miracle cream that I discovered on a cruise ship has done wonders for my skin. It goes on smoothly, has an AMAZING smell, and only requires a little each time. I have been using it for a little over a month, and I can already tell a difference in my skin. When I say a little goes a long way- I truly mean it. I put my index finger in the cream and take out about 1/4 of a teaspoon. YES, you heard me correctly 1/4 give or take a little. This is enough to cover my entire face and neck. I use it in the morning under my makeup and at night before I go to bed after I have washed my face with the facial wash which I also highly recommend. Cannot get enough of this stuff! Elemis literally has the BEST product available for your face. Wondering why I had to wait to go on a cruise to discover it!</li>
    <li> A friend wanted me to order this as he received a free sample on first class trip to Europe and loved the product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing, the smell is different though. I don&#x27;t really like the smell, but it fades after few minutes. The only problem is that I have to wait about 5 minutes after I put this on to put on my sunscreen. This product will make the sunscreen start to pill.</li>
    <li> Been using this for several years now and it&#x27;s the best I have found. Love it. I know it&#x27;s a little pricey but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I love this product but it is getting hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;The last two times it came in a tube as if from a beautician.&lt;br /&gt;It is the same lotion. I know because I have used it for years and love it.&lt;br /&gt;But what&#x27;s with the packaging? It should show a tube if that is how it is coming.</li>
    <li> A bit pricey, but an excellent face cream. I have tried others in different price ranges, but Elemis is just right on the skin and does not cause breakouts or feel greasy .</li>
    <li> Seems to give me the glow and smoothness I wanted from this cream...it is much less expensive on Amazon and it is the same product from what I can tell....love it!!</li>
    <li> First of all this cream has the most refreshing feel and smell when it is applied.  I have seen a little improvement in my skin, but I&lt;br /&gt;am a senior citizen so I can&#x27;t expect miracles from a cream; however, I also think it takes more time than the 3 weeks I&#x27;ve been&lt;br /&gt;using it.  I will continue to use it.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The Elemis Pro-Collagen Marine Cream has been one of my favorites for several years.  It moisturizes, hydrates, and soothes the skin.  I believe one of the best on the market.  It has a fresh, clean fragrance, does not overwhelm.  You see results in a short time.&lt;br /&gt;Great for dry or mature skin.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a couple years and really like it, I was greatly surprised to find it on Amazon at a reduced price, which makes the experience that much better.</li>
    <li> I have been using the neck &amp; bust cream now for several months. I was introduced to it like most other users....on a cruise. This facial cream is great. I live in Florida &amp; at 62 I can still get oily skin in this climate. This products is light &amp; is not clogging my pores.</li>
    <li> Great product.  It makes your skin feel moisturized and fresh.  Worth the price.</li>
    <li> Really enjoying this product.  Arrived promptly and as described.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday. I love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, good price for the quality!</li>
    <li> This cream is excellent for locking in moisture.</li>
    <li> This stuff is like magic! I have tried everything you can imagine in all price ranges and i LOVE the way this makes my skin look and feel!</li>
    <li> great product line highly recommended</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for years, just feel like I cannot live without it :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product and it&#x27;s price. Thank you</li>
    <li> I love this cream. My face is smooth and it does not cause blemishes. Which is hard for me to find with oily skin.</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  It moisturizers without leaving you skin greasy</li>
    <li> I started to use this a couple of years ago when I received it as a gift, my face has never been the same. I&#x27;ve tired other products and I have not found one that compares. It is a lot more expensive than I would normally like to spend but I only have to get a new one about 9-12 months. It&#x27;s just the initial expense that makes it seem worse.</li>
    <li> I love this product and my skin looks so healthy and toned.  It is helping with keeping my skin with a firmer look.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for 15 years and will never use anything else . I have tried many face creams having worked in a big retail store but elemis the best. I have so many surprised looks when I tell people how old I am and they always say you don&#x27;t have a wrinkle on your face and I tell them it&#x27;s the elemis cream . Light on the face but moisturizing  try it</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years after it was used on my face at a spa - love it. I have really dry skin and (of all of the other products I have tried in the past) this is the only moisturizer that has worked for me. A little goes a long way - it lasts me 6-7 months - so I didn&#x27;t mind paying the $128 online or at Nordstrom. I was even more happy when I found it at 1/2 the cost here. Same item - 1/2 the price - no brainer.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  It is a product you have to try for your self to believe how much it works.  What the years melt away,  I am almost 70 and people have guested my age to be 50.  It works!  Try it.</li>
    <li> Best product I have used. I highly recommend to any lady that wants smooth skin. Great for me. I am 75 yrs young.</li>
    <li> Broke out next morning. Tossed it!</li>
    <li> Have used it for two years and will always use it.</li>
    <li> My sister&#x27;s skin looks amazing after using this several months....so I have purchased it too!</li>
    <li> I had switched from Oil O&#x27;Lay afer using it for many years to Elemis Pro- Collagen and their oil capsules. It really works hydrating your skin and removing fine lines on my face. It&#x27;s a great product I greatly recommend trying it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for many years now and just love the effects. It has given me a more youthful appearance.</li>
    <li> Good deal and fast delivery. Happy shopping :D</li>
    <li> Your skin will thank you for this cream!</li>
    <li> Great product. Huge discount.</li>
    <li> I like this product. Lightweight, not greasy, moisturizes well.</li>
    <li> this cream works well and makes skin very smooth.</li>
    <li> I really like this cream, especially for the price I find at Amazon.  However, 1 jar only lasted just shy of 8 weeks (I&#x27;m on my 2nd jar now).  That breaks down to $1 a day to moisturize my face/neck!  I saw one reviewer said it lasts her 6-7 months.  I can&#x27;t see how that is possible.  I probably use a pea size, morning and night, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m overdoing it.  Not sure yet if I&#x27;ll reorder because it doesn&#x27;t go very far but I really do like the cream.</li>
