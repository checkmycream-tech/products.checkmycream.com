<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I waited about a week before of use, before I gave this review. I recieved all 32 items claw clips I ordered. They were packaged with extreme care. I examined each clip and was amazed at how gorgeous they were. The photos do them absolutely no justice! I am mixed, with long curly hair, therefore I&#x27;m very particular about hair accessories. Plastic clips don&#x27;t last and don&#x27;t do a great job. I&#x27;ve been using metal hair clips for over 15 years. These clips are high quality, hands down. The pricing is extemely reasonable. I truly have gotten my monies worth and then some. I would recommend this product to anyone, before going to a mall paying the outrageous prices. If I could rate this product any higher, I would!!!</li>
    <li> Its beautiful, but a bit heavy for my hair.</li>
    <li> Very pretty and does clip well, but my hair is thin and it does not really hold all of it. But the clip is beautiful,like a piece of jewelry for your hair...sparkles!!</li>
    <li> This is really a beautiful clip.  Medium sized, with all different colors of generous sized stones makes it shimmer beautifully in my hair.  I love it!</li>
    <li> the clip was absolutely gorgeous but the metal bracket that held the spring clip snapped the first week. i am so disappointed :(</li>

    <li> I saw this clip and just had to have it.  I love all the different colors in it, and the sparkling gems.  Wonderful dressy clip.</li>
    <li> Quite nice for that special occasion. A touch of jewelry for your hair.  Yet also for every day use when you want to fell femine.</li>
    <li> These are Beautiful hair clips, they are made strong and hold well, I have long hair and wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else to clip my hair up with...Such Beautiful colors. Every where I go strangers stop and ask me, where did you get that hair clip.</li>
    <li> If you wear your hair up often enough, this is for you.  It&#x27;s really worth every penny, I bought a few and they are gorgeous.</li>
    <li> This metal clip is studded with colored &amp;#34;gems&#x27; giving it lots of sparkle.  It weighs 1.7 ounces, about the same as a small chicken egg.  I would size it as a middle size.  It&#x27;s beautiful.</li>
    <li> Very pretty, excellant quality...a little smaller than expected.</li>
    <li> Beautiful hair accessory. Nice color stones. Looks great to wear for special occasions or going out for the night.</li>

    <li> Love this!  Top of clip looks like a butterfly.  I have gotten so many compliments for this clip!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s real metal!  Yellow gold tone with cheesy rhinestones, but I love it.  It is a bit heavy but it holds in my thin, straight hair better than the lightweight plastic clips I use.</li>
    <li> Wish I had exchanged this only because it is slightly too large for thickness of my hair. hope my daughter wiill&lt;br /&gt; enjoy it. Has tasteful &amp;#34;Bling&amp;#34;. Purchased for Holidays 2014, but they were a non invent due to illness, hospitalization,&lt;br /&gt;surgery, blindness. ??Actually bought 2 by mistake, have been too buy with health issues to see if an exchange can be made.&lt;br /&gt;Would be appreciative if seller were willing to contact me with alternates that I could wear. Too overwhelmed with more serious&lt;br /&gt;issues to instigate action over a hair accessorie. I cannot even drive to return package. Yes, that would be a pick me up, but not expected to happen after so many months. So many products from which to choose, took forever to decide, not my best selection for this type of item.  Quality of workmanshio is excellent, have other products from this seller</li>
