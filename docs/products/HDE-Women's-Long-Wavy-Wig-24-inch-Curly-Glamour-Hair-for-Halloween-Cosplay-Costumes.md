      <li>I love this wig!</li>
      <li>This wig was shockingly great quality for the price, and comfortable to boot.</li>
      <li>Looked just as nice a the picture curls and all.</li>
      <li>I saw this, liked the price, and bought it.</li>
      <li>It fits nice and looks really cute.</li>
      <li>It is very soft and the length is great, it untangles easily and fits very nicely.</li>
      <li>The color is gorgeous and it arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t buy an additional wig cap because it already comes with a wig net which worked out perfectly.</li>
      <li>This is the cheapest and most well built wig I&#x27;ve bought off amazon out of three.</li>
      <li>Literally, my top wig!&lt;br /&gt;People asked if it was real&lt;</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m in love</li>
      <li>I love love it.</li>
      <li>also really love the wig cap that came with it.</li>
      <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
      <li>Not bad when you selected the free shipping option!!</li>
      <li>The quality of the wig is pretty good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to wear &amp; I love the color.</li>
      <li>Wish it didn&#x27;t tangle as easy though,</li>
      <li>Amazing!  Thick and beautiful.</li>
      <li>I got a ton of compliments on it, people were always telling me what a nice wig it was and how pretty the color was.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very pretty!</li>
      <li>Also, the purple of this wig is FABULOUS.</li>
      <li>Overall, this should be great for fefeta &amp;#62;833</li>
      <li>I figured that the second day of the convention it would start to lose it&#x27;s glam, but NO, it stayed gorgeous for those 8 hours too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The color is true to the picture and the size was adjustable.  </li>
      <li>The product looks exactly like the picture shown, the curls are very durable, and it is very easy to put on.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very soft and full on the top.</li>
      <li>and I wanted to find a colorful wig to wear with my costume.</li>
      <li>I had a lot of fun playing with this wig</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s is such a gorgeous shade, in the light it almost looks iridescent with blue undertones.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a fantastic wig worth a little more</li>
      <li>First off.. this exceeded my expectations.</li>
      <li>Overall, I am thoroughly satisfied with this wig and I will need to find an occasion to wear it again.</li>
      <li>It is exactly how it looks.</li>
      <li>The only con is that it tangles easy.</li>
      <li>I wore this for 10+ hours straight and didn&#x27;t need to adjust or anything.  </li>
      <li>The adjustable hairnet is really helpful.</li>
      <li>To be honest, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but I only needed it to last a couple</li>
      <li>My hair is really thick, but the cap kept every one of my natural hairs from peaking out and made the wig more comfortable to wear.</li>
      <li>Highly reccommend.</li>

<li> crap this wig is so nice!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll be ordering it in other colors as well.</li>
<li> It tangles a lot though, but that is due to the nature of the curly hair style.</li>
<li> The hair does get a little tangled after some use but that is to be expected so</li>
<li> Got this for my daughter for Halloween and the only complaint she had was that it was a bit itchy (but she is picky with clothes so may not bother anyone else the way it did her).</li>
<li> I had to literally walk in the rain and wind to the convention, and never once did this wig lose its curls or get messy or tangled.</li>
<li> I was shocked that it was completely immaculate!</li>
<li> I had a hard time keeping it on my daughters head however.</li>
<li> and It was very hard to get the side bangs in place while covering the &amp;#34;ratty&amp;#34;</li>
<li> There is a removable tag on it with washing instructions, however I am very wary to wash this item.</li>

    <li> Very good product for the price. Got this for my daughter for Halloween and the only complaint she had was that it was a bit itchy (but she is picky with clothes so may not bother anyone else the way it did her). She still wears it even after Halloween and gets lots of compliments on it when she does.</li>
    <li> This wig was shockingly great quality for the price, and comfortable to boot. I&#x27;ll be ordering it in other colors as well.</li>
    <li> The quality of the wig is pretty good. It fits nice and looks really cute. It&#x27;s a great wig for the price for sure.</li>
    <li> I love this wig! It&#x27;s very pretty! The only con is that it tangles easy. It&#x27;s easy to wear &amp; I love the color. Wish it didn&#x27;t tangle as easy though, but I guess all of them are like that.</li>
    <li> Loved it. This was beautiful, high quality it was perfect for what I was looking for. Highly reccommend. Looked just as nice a the picture curls and all.</li>
    <li> So I needed a purple wig for my Lumpy Space Princess cosplay for Emerald Con in Seattle. I loved the way this one looked and got it. To be honest, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but I only needed it to last a couple days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holy crap this wig is so nice! I had to literally walk in the rain and wind to the convention, and never once did this wig lose its curls or get messy or tangled. I walked around for about 8 hours in this, never touched it up, and when I got a chance to look in the mirror I was shocked that it was completely immaculate! Also, the purple of this wig is FABULOUS. It&#x27;s is such a gorgeous shade, in the light it almost looks iridescent with blue undertones. I got a ton of compliments on it, people were always telling me what a nice wig it was and how pretty the color was. I figured that the second day of the convention it would start to lose it&#x27;s glam, but NO, it stayed gorgeous for those 8 hours too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really love the wig cap that came with it. My hair is really thick, but the cap kept every one of my natural hairs from peaking out and made the wig more comfortable to wear. I am totally impressed!</li>
    <li> best looking wig at Katy Perry Concert!</li>
    <li> The color is perfect!! I love love it. Also I ordered it on 10/13 and I received it on 10/19. Not bad when you selected the free shipping option!! I can&#x27;t wait to wear it as part of my Leela costume!!</li>
    <li> I bought this to go with my LSP cosplay and I LOVE it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great wig for the price. It tangles a lot though, but that is due to the nature of the curly hair style. Got lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> beautiful wig &amp; color.  wish i could wear it around as if it didn&#x27;t matter or it wasn&#x27;t unnatural.</li>
    <li> I did a variety show recently where I had to dress up as Katy Perry and I wanted to find a colorful wig to wear with my costume. I saw this, liked the price, and bought it. The product looks exactly like the picture shown, the curls are very durable, and it is very easy to put on. I didn&#x27;t buy an additional wig cap because it already comes with a wig net which worked out perfectly. I recommend it. The hair does get a little tangled after some use but that is to be expected so just watch out for that. Overall, I am thoroughly satisfied with this wig and I will need to find an occasion to wear it again.</li>
    <li> Amazing!  Thick and beautiful. Very pleased with this purchase</li>
    <li> What else can you say about a wig? I got it to dress up for an event and it was great! The adjustable hairnet is really helpful.</li>
    <li> The color is gorgeous and it arrived quickly. I had a hard time keeping it on my daughters head however.</li>
    <li> I had a lot of fun playing with this wig and I would consider ordering again. It is exactly how it looks.</li>
    <li> Its awesome! I actually straightened it, and then put in waves to get a thicker look, but props for not melting. Overall, this should be great for fefeta &amp;#62;833</li>
    <li> This is the cheapest and most well built wig I&#x27;ve bought off amazon out of three. This is the only one that is made well enough to be worn without a hat or a beanie. It&#x27;s very soft and full on the top. You can tell it&#x27;s plastic but it&#x27;s very good quality! It doesn&#x27;t go great with my skin tone but it&#x27;s a fantastic wig worth a little more</li>
    <li> The color is true to the picture and the size was adjustable.  I wore this for 10+ hours straight and didn&#x27;t need to adjust or anything.  Great quality!!!!</li>
    <li> Literally, my top wig!&lt;br /&gt;People asked if it was real&lt;br /&gt;It fits good and looks great&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in love</li>
    <li> First off.. this exceeded my expectations. It is very soft and the length is great, it untangles easily and fits very nicely. However the only thing that I am not pleased with is the very front of the wig, the small hair under the bangs is very tangled and It was very hard to get the side bangs in place while covering the &amp;#34;ratty&amp;#34; hairs underneath. I might trim them the next time I wear it, but for now i just tucked them under the cap. I would purchase this item again with out a doubt. There is a removable tag on it with washing instructions, however I am very wary to wash this item.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Was not expecting the quality to be so good for the price.</li>
