    <li> Case did not fit my Note4. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Quite stylish and it brings out my playful side.</li>
    <li> Very thin and flimsy, light as a feather. Easily comes apart/bends like cardboard, doesn&#x27;t really hold cards securely.  Not what I expected.  Definitely not worth more than the $3 it&#x27;s selling for if that.</li>
    <li> Cute... but really poorly made</li>
    <li> Its ok but the siding  has already cracked on the side when i was putting the phone in the case</li>
    <li> My case didn&#x27;t come with a strap. The case is nice and fashionable.  However,  when you close the case and then touch the front it activates the phone. I don&#x27;t understand why.</li>
    <li> This phone case was beautiful when it came in but you could tell that it was made out of cheap material. I even dropped my case a couple of times and the case scratched. It&#x27;s not for long term use only temporary.</li>
    <li> Nice looking... but hard to be on phone while in case. Arrived on delivery date.</li>
    <li> Do not buy these plastic pieces of junk.  They do not fit right and the strap broke the first day within a couple of hours.  Luckily I as not near water or somewhere that when it dropped it would have been ruined or lost forever.</li>
    <li> Thought I was ordering  a case for the S4 but it was for the S4 note, gave it to my niece and she enjoys it.</li>
    <li> This item wasn&#x27;t made near as nice as others I&#x27;ve purchased for the same price.</li>
    <li> Just got the case yesterday it&#x27;s awesome</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this case.  First of all , it was not leather its plastic.  The back piece that holds the inside case in place was glued together.  As soon as I put the phone in the case, and tried to pull the phone out again.  The back of the case and the phone holder started coming apart.  Even though it was just $5 , I did expect more!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product very good</li>
    <li> I like the case cuz DUH its Leopard print and i LOVE leaopard print.. but the wrist strap broke after like 2 days of use write off my wrist and onto the floor my phone went and of course the case cracked smh.. its nice to look at but not good to use</li>
    <li> It says leather and it was plastic. I&#x27;m not impressed and very dissatisfied</li>
    <li> This case is awesome..pretty..feminine and is a wallet case so it is resourceful...I love it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice case and I received it a lot sooner than the projected arrival date. I have not yet used it but will do so in the future.  The only thing that surprised me was that this is a hard plastic case and not a faux leather which I would have preferred.</li>
    <li> The plastic piece that holds the phone broke a couple of days after I received it and had to super glue it back together!!!!!</li>
