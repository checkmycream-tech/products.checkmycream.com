### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and I&#x27;m impressed with the color.</li>
      <li>OPI is the best nail polish.  </li>
      <li>It just makes you feel good to wear it and it wears well!!</li>
      <li>Perfect color!</li>
      <li>Color looks GREAT, if you want shiny, get this!</li>
      <li>I am happy with it.  </li>
      <li>Great color</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very nice over another color.</li>
      <li>NICE!  </li>
      <li>I love the &amp;#34;sparkle&amp;#34; and it wears beautifully.</li>
      <li>This color of polish is the most attractive I have ever worn.  </li>
      <li>But I LOVE this!</li>
      <li>It is a nice color and nice nail polish.</li>
      <li>so this is a great way to find some of the older colors!!</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s not to love about that?</li>
      <li>I love the OPI brand.</li>
      <li>well it&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>AND THEY WERE SURE THEY HAD CUSTOMERS WHO WOULD LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>But when I wanted remove it ,it&#x27;s took many time and it was stressul for my nail.</li>
      <li>Love this polish.</li>
      <li>If you love glitter polish and don&#x27;t mind a shade difference than this color is for you.</li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s supposed to be a top coat--</li>
      <li>Love the sparkle</li>
      <li>the color is beautiful and very shiny, and strong cover, and cover is not smoth .</li>
      <li>Beautiful color with just enough bling!</li>
      <li>quick and easy business.  </li>
      <li>It also dries very rough, you&#x27;ll probably need 2 coats of a good top coat to have a smooth finish.  </li>
      <li>CAME QUICKLY AND WAS AS DISCRIBED.  </li>
      <li>This polish is very pretty on the nail.  </li>
      <li>First of all, it has very large flakes of &amp;#34;glitter&amp;#34;, and is not quite as smooth on your nails.  </li>
      <li>What a fun bottle of nail polish.  </li>
      <li>It shipped very fast</li>
      <li>While the sparkles are more than I really care for, the color is a very pretty red.</li>
      <li>I love it over the Minnie Mouse series liquid sand called \\&quot;magazine cover mouse\\&quot;, but think its a shame to need a second color to get the use out of it.</li>
      <li>It did look very festive for the 4th of July!  </li>
      <li>and I wore it over my favorite red polish over the holidays as a winter color and ALWAYS got compliments.</li>
      <li>When I compare the beautiful, smooth, holographic polishes OPI has marketed in the past as Designer Series polishes, in my opinion this one is not worthy of the Designer Series label.</li>
      <li>I usually love OPI but this particular polish is no better than your cheap drug store brand.</li>
      <li>The nail polish came to me covered in another nail polish... a much lighter shade.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>The only problem is it chips like 2 days in, so use and extra layer of top coat.</li>
      <li>This DS OPI Polish is very different from the other 6-7 DS colors I currently own.</li>
      <li>This is one of those glitters that is too dense to layer over another color, but takes at least 3 coats to be opaque on its own.  </li>
      <li>Amazon was the only place I could find it, but it is well worth the money.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more pink then red...</li>
      <li>OK, so this is GLITTER polish, which I never really cared for and thought was only for young girls.</li>
      <li>The texture of the brush handle is not right and If you look at the top all opi bottles have a dot in the middle of the p</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not bold enough to wear this shade on my fingers (yet), but I love it on my toes.</li>
      <li>Unless you&#x27;re a real glitter fan (in which case you probably already have a similar color to this polish)</li>
      <li>Definitely sparkly red, but more work than other DS OPI colors.</li>
      <li>This is pretty, but really nothing new, other polish brands have colors very similar to this; it looks a LOT like China Glaze&#x27;s \\&quot;Mrs.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hot pink and glittery.</li>
      <li>The price was reasonable and it came quicker then expected was why I didn&#x27;t rate this lower.</li>
      <li>The glitter barely shows up.</li>
      <li>Just the right amount of sparkle for everyday wear.  </li>
      <li>On the upside it was much easier to remove than other colors with sparkles that I have used.</li>
      <li>However, when I tried to remove the polish, another big difference became very apparent.</li>

<li> However, when I tried to remove the polish, another big difference became very apparent.</li>
<li> OPI DS Bold has a lightly tinted red base with medium pinkish red and silver glitter.</li>
<li> Be aware, though, it&#x27;s tough to remove -</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a pink shade</li>
<li> I always use a base coat, two color coats and a top coat, so maybe only one coat of polish would be easier to remove.</li>
<li> It wasn&#x27;t as durable as other OPI colors I have used.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s harder than heck to get off!  </li>
<li> This is a very sheer polish that doesn&#x27;t cover well without either 3-4 coats or very heavy coats.</li>
<li> I was a little disappointed when it arrived because I was under the impression it would be more grapefruit color</li>
<li> Removal is the typical time consuming soak off for which glitters are notorious.</li>
<li> has green or black labels on the bottom</li>
<li> It is unlike any other of the DS Series colors I have tried (and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few)!  </li>
<li> This is a complete fake</li>
<li> The bottle looks like it should be very close to a red, but is a see through shocking pink with lots of pink glitter.</li>
<li> Not cool, and definitely not good for my nails.</li>
<li> Yes, hard to remove, but what do you expect from a glitter polish?</li>
<li> Been wearing for at least 2 years continuously.</li>
<li> Sorry it is being discontinued.</li>
<li> I was truly disappointed with this color.  </li>
<li> I disappointed by this polish .and</li>
<li> this is a moron color.</li>
<li> All I know is that I really hate this color.</li>
<li> This is one of the worst nail polishes I have ever used.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The nail polish came to me covered in another nail polish... a much lighter shade.  It was all over the bottle.  I emailed the seller about this because this was to be a gift.  My response I received, use nail polish remover.  NICE!  Well I did.. took the silver finish all off of the brush... could not give it as a gift.  Had to go out and purchase something else.</li>
    <li> the color is beautiful and very shiny, and strong cover, and cover is not smoth . well it&#x27;s ok. But when I wanted remove it ,it&#x27;s took many time and it was stressul for my nail. I don&#x27;t want cover again. I disappointed by this polish .and don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> This color of polish is the most attractive I have ever worn.  I have literally received scores of compliments from friends and family when wearing this polish.  I ordered two bottles so as to never be without it.  The color goes with every outfit one would want to wear.</li>
    <li> Yes, hard to remove, but what do you expect from a glitter polish? Color looks GREAT, if you want shiny, get this!</li>
    <li> This nail polish is not the shade I ordered it is similar to the opi color but it is not. The texture of the brush handle is not right and If you look at the top all opi bottles have a dot in the middle of the p and this doesn&#x27;t have one it is not opi do not buy this product and opi has green or black labels on the bottom this is a moron color. This is a complete fake</li>
    <li> I was truly disappointed with this color.  It is unlike any other of the DS Series colors I have tried (and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few)!  It is like a sheer purple with big flakes of glitter in it.  The glitter will not go on evenly.  There is no coverage.  Maybe it&#x27;s supposed to be a top coat--I don&#x27;t know.  All I know is that I really hate this color.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s more pink then red... Fyi</li>
    <li> OPI polish is always #1 in my book, and this color was no exception, I got a lot of compliments. BUT when it was time to change polish i literally had to buff this off my nail. Not cool, and definitely not good for my nails. I won&#x27;t be using this for a while, give my nails a rest!</li>
    <li> OPI DS Bold has a lightly tinted red base with medium pinkish red and silver glitter. This is pretty, but really nothing new, other polish brands have colors very similar to this; it looks a LOT like China Glaze&#x27;s \\&quot;Mrs. Claus\\&quot;. When I compare the beautiful, smooth, holographic polishes OPI has marketed in the past as Designer Series polishes, in my opinion this one is not worthy of the Designer Series label. This is one of those glitters that is too dense to layer over another color, but takes at least 3 coats to be opaque on its own.  It also dries very rough, you&#x27;ll probably need 2 coats of a good top coat to have a smooth finish.  Removal is the typical time consuming soak off for which glitters are notorious. Unless you&#x27;re a real glitter fan (in which case you probably already have a similar color to this polish) I&#x27;d skip this one.</li>
    <li> I had my nails done at a salon and they had this color. Amazon was the only place I could find it, but it is well worth the money. It is a nice color and nice nail polish.</li>
    <li> This DS OPI Polish is very different from the other 6-7 DS colors I currently own. First of all, it has very large flakes of &amp;#34;glitter&amp;#34;, and is not quite as smooth on your nails.  While the sparkles are more than I really care for, the color is a very pretty red. It did look very festive for the 4th of July!  However, when I tried to remove the polish, another big difference became very apparent. It&#x27;s harder than heck to get off!  It took a lot of cotton balls and remover to finally get the gritty stuff off. I always use a base coat, two color coats and a top coat, so maybe only one coat of polish would be easier to remove. Definitely sparkly red, but more work than other DS OPI colors.</li>
    <li> OK, so this is GLITTER polish, which I never really cared for and thought was only for young girls. But I LOVE this! It&#x27;s a pink shade and I wore it over my favorite red polish over the holidays as a winter color and ALWAYS got compliments. Be aware, though, it&#x27;s tough to remove - you&#x27;ll need a lot of cotton rounds and plenty acetone polish-remover.</li>
    <li> When I received this I had to use pliers to open it because me nor my boyfriend could open it ourselves.  Anyway, the polish is alright. I usually love OPI but this particular polish is no better than your cheap drug store brand. The glitter barely shows up.</li>
    <li> OPI is the best nail polish.  I saw this at a salon and the next day I ordered it from Amazaon.  quick and easy business.  Thanks</li>
    <li> What a fun bottle of nail polish.  It just makes you feel good to wear it and it wears well!!</li>
    <li> This polish is very pretty on the nail.  Just the right amount of sparkle for everyday wear.  It wasn&#x27;t as durable as other OPI colors I have used.  It started peeling after 4 days.  On the upside it was much easier to remove than other colors with sparkles that I have used.</li>
    <li> This is a very sheer polish that doesn&#x27;t cover well without either 3-4 coats or very heavy coats. The bottle looks like it should be very close to a red, but is a see through shocking pink with lots of pink glitter. It&#x27;s very nice over another color. I love it over the Minnie Mouse series liquid sand called \\&quot;magazine cover mouse\\&quot;, but think its a shame to need a second color to get the use out of it.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color with just enough bling!</li>
    <li> Love this polish. Been wearing for at least 2 years continuously. Sorry it is being discontinued.</li>
    <li> CAME QUICKLY AND WAS AS DISCRIBED.  HOWEVER, IT WASN&#x27;T MY CUP OF TEA, GAVE IT TO MY NAIL SHOP AND THEY WERE SURE THEY HAD CUSTOMERS WHO WOULD LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> I had one bottle of this color OPI and it is getting low so I ordered another one to have in reserve.  I love the &amp;#34;sparkle&amp;#34; and it wears beautifully.</li>
    <li> I love the OPI brand. It shipped very fast and I&#x27;m impressed with the color. If you like the OPI brand you should get this.</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed when it arrived because I was under the impression it would be more grapefruit color then what came. If you love glitter polish and don&#x27;t mind a shade difference than this color is for you. The price was reasonable and it came quicker then expected was why I didn&#x27;t rate this lower.</li>
    <li> Perfect color! The only problem is it chips like 2 days in, so use and extra layer of top coat.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not bold enough to wear this shade on my fingers (yet), but I love it on my toes. It&#x27;s hot pink and glittery. What&#x27;s not to love about that?</li>
    <li> This is one of the worst nail polishes I have ever used. Definitely not what I was expecting from opi. It began to chip the very same day I put it on.</li>
    <li> I am happy with it.  Great color and I received it in 3 days.</li>
    <li> I never go without polish so this is a great way to find some of the older colors!! Love the sparkle</li>
