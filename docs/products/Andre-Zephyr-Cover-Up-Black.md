### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It works perfectly.  </li>
      <li>This one is great!  </li>
      <li>but after seeing how well it works makes perfect sense.  </li>
      <li>I used it today, and it was wonderful.  </li>
      <li>I worked perfectly!!!</li>
      <li>This is just perfect!</li>
      <li>Perfect.  </li>
      <li>Perfect for cleaning days around the house when I always seem to ruin whatever I am wearing with cleansers and bleach.  </li>
      <li>I am quite happy with it, though the price was overdone.  </li>
      <li>Very nice for bathing dogs.</li>
      <li>It fits well and looks good.  </li>
      <li>Well worth keeping my hair stylist happy!</li>
      <li>handy and give it a good spritz before using the cover up.</li>
      <li>So glad I got this, love it!!</li>
      <li>Works wonderful, but is very large.</li>
      <li>Buy it on Amazon for sure, unless you are in a hurry (with overnight roots!)</li>
      <li>I have been coloring my own hair for 30 years.  </li>
      <li>Has 2 pockets that come handy.</li>
      <li>She&#x27;s super happy with it.  </li>
      <li>Instead, it cost more than a lot of well made blouses I own.  </li>
      <li>It has buttons, which I like better than the wrap around smocks.  </li>
      <li>Its WAY better than the velcro used on the vinyl capes as the velcro will grab onto the cape in the wash and contribute to ripping it up.  </li>
      <li>I am an artist, an oil painter, and needed something better than an apron.</li>
      <li>I love this cover-up</li>
      <li>Most of the \\&quot;groomers&#x27;\\&quot; coverups are twice the price or more.  </li>
      <li>One size fits most should not be a xml.</li>
      <li>(I did actually see that as a feature on a smock sold specifically to groomers, so thought this was a great alternative), but I find it to have a bit of static cling, causing hair to stick to the coverup.  </li>
      <li>Easy, clean buttons, plus one clip for my neck towel work much better.    </li>
      <li>This thing is huge.</li>
      <li>I got everything I needed before I dyed my hair with Henna, light and medium brown dye.</li>
      <li>Very useful for my art projects.</li>
      <li>I was completely covered and warm while coloring my hair.  </li>
      <li>So that will contribute to it lasting many many years.      </li>
      <li>I bought it at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply as I needed it quick.  </li>
      <li>I believe it is actually made for a stylist to wear herself to protect her own clothing while she does your hair.  </li>
      <li>, it : covers up my front and back side, its water proof, has pockets, is 3/4 sleeves (sleeves don&#x27;t get in the way, but cover up shoulders and elbows), it&#x27;s easy to clean (I just wash it down in the shower) and has the best button up (big and easy button holes for when your wearing gloves.)</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t want to get a cape because I figured I would need the extra arm movement to color my hair, and being the first time I colored my own hair</li>
      <li>as I was  ;)</li>
      <li>The jewel neckline is somewhat large, so my neck was exposed...</li>
      <li>Since my purpose was to keep hairs from sticking to and embedding into my everyday clothes when grooming, this accomplishes that nicely.</li>
      <li>The quality of the shirt is better than average.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Thought it was a little over the top</li>
      <li>That said, it is easy enough to take outside and shake off any leftover hairs when I am done.  </li>
      <li>I use a dark auburn color, which most definitely stains any clothing I&#x27;m wearing, as I&#x27;ve gotten splashes of the color on my bathroom rugs</li>
      <li>but no problem, I devoted an old hand towel to be my \\&quot;neck cover\\&quot; and wrapped it around my neck, secured with a clip, and then put on the nylon shirt.  </li>
      <li>My only complaint is that it&#x27;s always static-y, so I keep a can of Static Guard</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> One size fits most should not be a xml. This thing is huge.</li>
    <li> I thought I orded a cover- up for a woman. When it arrived the  bottons were on the wrong side. It is on the side of a man&#x27;s shirt.</li>
    <li> Bought it to protect my clothes from leaking feathers from my down coats (Lining them professionally with extra layer would have cost me a fortune). Serves its purpose. Has 2 pockets that come handy.</li>
    <li> I have been coloring my own hair for 30 years.  I had been using one of the nylon shampoo capes to cover my shoulders while I colored my hair, but it never worked well for several reasons.  One, it left me open to the elements on the sides...and since I was naked from the waist up in anticipation of jumping in the shower after coloring, it was uncomfortable for me to run around the house for 45 minutes while I waited for the color to be done.  Also, the cape wouldn&#x27;t cover my arms and I would end up with spots on my arms.    Finally, I ordered this button-down shirt style cover up.  I used it today, and it was wonderful.  I believe it is actually made for a stylist to wear herself to protect her own clothing while she does your hair.  But the weave of this nylon is so tight that I got nothing on me through the shirt and I was using a dark brown on my hair.      Anyway, it is quite roomy, even though my chest is 44 inches.  And the sleeves are long as pictured.  I was completely covered and warm while coloring my hair.  The jewel neckline is somewhat large, so my neck was exposed...but no problem, I devoted an old hand towel to be my \\&quot;neck cover\\&quot; and wrapped it around my neck, secured with a clip, and then put on the nylon shirt.  Perfect.  Its WAY better than the velcro used on the vinyl capes as the velcro will grab onto the cape in the wash and contribute to ripping it up.  So I&#x27;d rather not have it.  Easy, clean buttons, plus one clip for my neck towel work much better.    The quality of the shirt is better than average.  No strings or tags, and the selvedges are even finished.  I don&#x27;t anticipate that it will come undone at seams as I only use it once every six weeks, and then it gets washed only with the neck towel (as they have hair dye on them).  It&#x27;s not recommended to dry as you can melt nylon.  So that will contribute to it lasting many many years.      I am quite happy with it, though the price was overdone.  I bought it at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply as I needed it quick.  It was $18.99 - $1 for being a Sally&#x27;s Card customer.  It is made in China and they could have likely made a profit by charging us $5.99.  Instead, it cost more than a lot of well made blouses I own.  I can&#x27;t see the Amazon price for this item as I write this review, but if memory serves me, it was $15.99.  Buy it on Amazon for sure, unless you are in a hurry (with overnight roots!) as I was  ;)</li>
    <li> It fits well and looks good.  It collects a lot of hair, but I am hoping that lessen with washing and use.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend loves it. It keeps her dry at work.</li>
    <li> I bought this cover up to wear when I have my hair colored and cut at the salon.  I was tired of wearing the ones they supplied which didn&#x27;t button and didn&#x27;t fit.  This one is great!  It&#x27;s short, but long enough.  It has buttons, which I like better than the wrap around smocks.  I take it with me to the salon when I have my hair done and just keep it in the car so it&#x27;s always there.  I definitely recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> Works wonderful, but is very large. I&#x27;m 5&amp;#34;3 130lbs and this thing is like a tent on me. It does it&#x27;s job though.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted this to keep my hair from getting all over her clothes while giving me a trim.  She&#x27;s super happy with it.  Thought it was a little over the top but after seeing how well it works makes perfect sense.  Well worth keeping my hair stylist happy!</li>
    <li> I bought this for at home use when I color my hair.  It works perfectly.  I use a dark auburn color, which most definitely stains any clothing I&#x27;m wearing, as I&#x27;ve gotten splashes of the color on my bathroom rugs (oops!).  With this cover up, I don&#x27;t have to worry about what I&#x27;m wearing, nor do I have to worry about getting drops of color on my arms or back that I cannot see that temporarily discolor that spot on my body.  My only complaint is that it&#x27;s always static-y, so I keep a can of Static Guard handy and give it a good spritz before using the cover up.</li>
    <li> I am an artist, an oil painter, and needed something better than an apron. This is just perfect!</li>
    <li> I actually purchased this as a lower cost option as a coverup to wear when grooming my dogs.  Most of the \\&quot;groomers&#x27;\\&quot; coverups are twice the price or more.  I don&#x27;t know if the described teflon coating has anything to do with it (I did actually see that as a feature on a smock sold specifically to groomers, so thought this was a great alternative), but I find it to have a bit of static cling, causing hair to stick to the coverup.  That said, it is easy enough to take outside and shake off any leftover hairs when I am done.  Since my purpose was to keep hairs from sticking to and embedding into my everyday clothes when grooming, this accomplishes that nicely.</li>
    <li> I have long hair and needed a long and comfortable cover-up for dying and cutting my hair.  I love this cover-up, it : covers up my front and back side, its water proof, has pockets, is 3/4 sleeves (sleeves don&#x27;t get in the way, but cover up shoulders and elbows), it&#x27;s easy to clean (I just wash it down in the shower) and has the best button up (big and easy button holes for when your wearing gloves.) I&#x27;ve already used it a few times. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I got everything I needed before I dyed my hair with Henna, light and medium brown dye. I worked perfectly!!! It does button up, I had used one of these before when I got my haircut by a salon and theirs zipped up. I didn&#x27;t want to get a cape because I figured I would need the extra arm movement to color my hair, and being the first time I colored my own hair, I didn&#x27;t want to take chances. So glad I got this, love it!! I will use this every time I color my hair! Plus I will use this when I trim my hair, so I wont have to worry about little hairs and itching from them.</li>
    <li> Very nice for bathing dogs.</li>
    <li> horrible...dust sticks to the jacket</li>
    <li> Perfect for cleaning days around the house when I always seem to ruin whatever I am wearing with cleansers and bleach.  Hopefully, no more.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised. Very useful for my art projects.</li>
    <li> I wear this as a dog grooming coat and I also bought one to wear when doing my hair and putting on make-up.</li>
