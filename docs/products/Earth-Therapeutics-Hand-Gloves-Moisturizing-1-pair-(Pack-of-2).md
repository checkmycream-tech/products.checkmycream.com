<li> this is waste of money ..</li>

    <li> I usually use Malcolm&#x27;s Moisture Jamzz gloves, but these were slightly cheaper, so I tried them. They are not nearly a good as Jamzz. The fabric is flimsier and they are not very stretchy. They seem like cheap gloves from China. Jamzz are made in the USA, another reason to buy them. I wouldn&#x27;t make the mistake of buying these again. If you like these gloves, you can buy several pairs for the same price if you just buy cotton gloves from China on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  ps I just reordered Malcolm&#x27;s Moisture Jamzz gloves and they have degraded in quality and fabric. The fabric USED to be thick and you could not see through it when your gloves were on. Not so now, not as much stretch and the fabric is flimsier. Definite decrease in quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other gloves for my hands at night and after a few uses and a wash, they would fall apart.  But these gloves have been used many times and gone through the wash and show no sign of wear.</li>
    <li> I love these gloves! I wear them with lotion at night, and my hands are always nice and soft in the morning. I was afraid that they would get too hot, and I would wake up in the middle of the night to take them off, but that usually isn&#x27;t the case. They feel nice and snug on your hands but not tight or uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> If you find yourself picking your skin at night put these on. I bought two pair and keep them close to your bed so that you will have no excuses not to wear them.</li>
    <li> These gloves are terrible.  Instead of moisturizing your hands, they suck all of the moisture off of them.  You would be much better off putting socks on your hands.  At least those would help you lock the moisture in.  These gloves absorb all of the moisture and leave your hands dryer than they would be without wearing them!  I refunded these after a couple tries.  Totally useless.</li>
    <li> I really do like these gloves.  I put some of my own lotion on with them while watching tv, then take them off when I&#x27;m ready for bed.  They do make my hands feel alot softer and smoother. Would recommend them to a friend.</li>
    <li> I have incredibly dry hands, particularly around the cuticles. I don&#x27;t use these gloves with any of the actual earth therapeutics lotions. I use the Yu-Be moisturizing skin cream instead.But my hands feel so soft and smooth and I&#x27;m no longer having to carry around a tube of lotion with me everywhere I go. The Yu-Be cream has helped a lot, but these have made a perfect compliment to the cream.</li>
    <li> this is waste of money .. it absorb the hand lotion instead of my skin &#x3D;/&lt;br /&gt;and plus the (Free trial size lotion ) wasn&#x27;t included .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyhow the gloves useful if you feel bit cold in home.</li>
    <li> Good product for use with your favorite moisturizer.  I try to use them a couple nights a week to keep my hands looking good.  Have to be wiliing to go the extra mile when you have ageing hands.</li>
    <li> I was under the impression that there was a moisturizer involved.&lt;br /&gt;I put my own moisturizer on then put them on before sleep.&lt;br /&gt;I guess the best thing to do is to have worn rubber gloves when I was younger while working with dishes and what not, and my hands would look a little better and then not need this.</li>
    <li> These gloves are so soft and well made. I put hand cream on at night and the next morning there is a noticeable difference in the look of the hands. It was a great purchase and I would definitely buy them again.</li>
    <li> Both gloves that I ordered were not good! Thought one might have different material . Not satisfied might both be sending it back</li>
    <li> I bought these gloves because I have dry hands. I use my own aloe containing lotion and put the gloves on after most of it has been absorbed by my skin. I don&#x27;t use them overnight, but even doing it once or twice a day works very well for me. They don&#x27;t make your hands feel hot, and that is important. I recommend these gloves, especially because they are sold as two pairs. The price is worth it.</li>
    <li> still use them...works great</li>
    <li> I have Raynaud&#x27;s and my hands are always cold and develop sores.  Wearing these gloves at night after moisturizing my hands with lotion is a big help!</li>
    <li> The gloves say \\&quot;one size fits most\\&quot;, and they did not fit me. I am 6ft tall and normal weight, the gloves had a very tight fit and stretched quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gloves are made from absorbent cotton, so most of the hand lotion goes into the fabric.</li>
    <li> My hands get softer now, I use almond oil with my hand lotion, after, I use these gloves before going to sleep, I don&#x27;t use them during all night, also they don&#x27;t get my hands hot.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend them if you have a very dry hands like mine.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Nice quality; not cheaply made like some other brands. Size was correct whereas other brands that i tried were too small for a man&#x27;s hand.&lt;br /&gt;Received them the next day.</li>
    <li> I have hand eczema so a really good pair of gloves are crucial to keep my hands soft. I purchased the pack of 2 and am so happy that I did.The gloves definitely keep the moisture in overnight (when used with lotion) and my hands aren&#x27;t dry (or even close to dry/cracking) in the morning. Good deal.</li>
    <li> I use these gloves with Earth Therapeutic mosturizing hand cream and love how young my 60 year old hands look.  I bought to moisturize and warm my arthritic hands on cold nights and find it works great for both the pain and moisturizing.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have just had these for one day.  However, I put lotion and oil on my hands and put these gloves on and went to bed last night, and they already look and feel softer.  I have tried similar gloves before, but they bothered me, and I had to take them off.  These are so light &amp; stretchy, I kept them on all night.  A bonus is getting 2 pairs.  Love them.</li>
    <li> I love these gloves!  They stay on all night without slipping or coming off, the lotion did not bleed through the fabric and they are very comfortable to wear.</li>
    <li> Noticeable difference in my skin after sleeping with my moisturizing gloves each night.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting greasy ointments on my pillow or sheets.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my husband.  The skin on his hands gets so dry and cracked in the winter I thought these gloves and a good hand cream would help.  He wears the gloves every couple of nights and his hands are soft and moisturized</li>
    <li> The gloves fit well, the seams seem well made, they protect my hands while I have medication on them.  They wash nicely, and I expect them to last.</li>
    <li> The cotton quality of these gloves is great. They have a little lycra which gives them a little stretch. I have purchased other cotton gloves that have lower quality cotton and stretch out after 1 wearing and are loose on my hands. These gloves stay on nicely while I sleep and feel great on my skin.</li>
    <li> These gloves are very soft.  I have large hands, some gloves in stores are tight.  These fit fine.  They are snug but comfortable.  I have had some gloves that are so loose they fall off in bed.  I have washed these several times, putting them in a lingerie bag.  They come out just fine.</li>
    <li> My hands get very dry - especially in winter - so I liked the idea of being able to slather on extra lotion and wear these gloves overnight. Unfortunately, they made no difference. I suppose the gloves are absorbing the extra lotion. At any rate, my hands feel the same regardless of whether I&#x27;m wearing the gloves overnight. The one advantage is that, after I put the gloves on, I can do things with my hands right after applying the lotion and gloves without worrying about slipping around - I can turn off the lamp, I can pet the cat, etc. Overall, though, I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
    <li> These are very good for using a thick, very thick for me as I use a hoof dressing, Hoof Alive, for my hands. I bought the large and glad I did since the finger tips are big for me but allow the dressing to stay on my finger tips.</li>
    <li> No matter how much lotion you put on your hands, it seems like the gloves just soak it all up. I wake up with hands that are just as dry as always. I&#x27;m going to experiment with some different lotions and find something that might hold better. The other thing as that the fingers are very tight (I&#x27;m a female with pretty small hands) so I find that I sometimes pull them off in the middle of the night. Probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> My wife loves to put goo on her hands sometimes at night to soften them. These gloves work out perfectly for her. They keep the good stuff where it&#x27;s supposed to be and not on the pillow or sheets.</li>
    <li> I like the fit of the gloves but did not notice how they could be moisturizing gloves.  I use my own hand lotion and found the gloves to be really helpful in helping my dry hands.</li>
    <li> After only a few overnight uses with some moisturizing cream I noticed a difference. They were a little snug on him, but I would buy them again and again for him!</li>
    <li> Lived up to it&#x27;s description, my mom loves them and they are comfortable for sleeping. Good value for the price.</li>
    <li> Ok.  But do not fit as snugly as I would have liked.  For the price, they are worked out alright.</li>
    <li> great little gloves for overnight deep conditioning of the hands, I may get another pair to use when I am outside in the garden</li>
    <li> I would give 0 stars if i could. These gloves are a joke. Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did. You can find better quality gloves at the Dollar store.</li>
