      <li>I recommend it 100%, and it&#x27;s worth every penny!!!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s very easy to inadvertently change the temperature when you&#x27;re just trying to turn the dryer on and off.  </li>
      <li>For those going natural this is a great choice!!</li>
      <li>The power of the dryer is great; it&#x27;s powerful and the dryer works well</li>

      <li>This hair dryer has made a huge difference!</li>
      <li>I love this blowdryer.</li>
      <li>I got the name of the dryer from him and immediately did a search online to find it - and Amazon definitely has the best price out there!  </li>
      <li>I LOVE this blow dryer.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the dryer.  </li>
      <li>that I know what a better dryer feels like.</li>
      <li>So much better than the T3.</li>
      <li>(after one year): I still love this hair dryer, and it&#x27;s working just as well as the day I purchased it.</li>
      <li>Invest in yourself, especially if you feel your hair has to be perfect</li>
      <li>I had many customers complain about it.</li>
      <li>I love this blow dryer...</li>
      <li>This blow dryer is an investment, but thanks to the great reviews I was confident in giving it a try, and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
      <li>I mostly deal with natural/afro/tightly coiled hair</li>
      <li>it will be an even better item for home users.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re going to spend an obscene amount of money on a hair dryer, it better do what it claims.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, I really like the dryer and my hair comes out great.</li>
      <li>I bought it to replace my Babyliss hair dryer (dropped it too many times...) and preferred the Babyliss.     </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s impressive, because a standard dryer would take about 45 minutes to do the job.  </li>
      <li>What more do you want from a dryer?  </li>
      <li>I am able to wash my hair every two - three days without feeling self-conscious.  </li>
      <li>I won this dryer from FHI many years ago and swore that I would never pay over $100 for a hair dryer.</li>
      <li>I love this hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>it is top of the line.</li>
      <li>Im sure my hair would be straighter w/</li>
      <li>so when it dries it dries more curly and frizzy</li>
      <li>but when my wife says \\&quot;I love it\\&quot; it gets five stars.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t much better.</li>
      <li>Also, this dryer&#x27;s cool shot feature is amazing, feels like air conditioning.</li>
      <li>One of the best gifts I&#x27;ve given her in a long time, and</li>
      <li>and it looks as good as the first day.  </li>
      <li>I reiterate that this dryer is worth the cost, and I think that every girl with frizzy hair deserves to own one.</li>
      <li>I reiterate that this dryer is worth the cost, and I think that every girl with frizzy hair deserves to own one.old dryer.</li>
      <li>and I can honestly say that it was worth every penny.</li>
      <li>It seemed to have all the latest and greatest technology and bells and whistles (3 heat settings, cool button, 3 air speeds with ion, ceramic heat), but my hair just wasn&#x27;t getting dry.</li>
      <li>but I wish the buttons were designed better so that I didn&#x27;t always hit the cool button and that the on/off switch were easier to turn the blower on and off.</li>
      <li>This hair dryer seems to not damage my fine hair at all but leaves it feeling silky and lightweight.</li>
      <li>The dryer works just fine</li>
      <li>but it looked very shiny and healthy also!</li>
      <li>This blow dryer dries my hair fast, straight, and my hair feels great.</li>
      <li>cord is a HUGE problem.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this hair dryer because of the fabulous reviews it received.</li>
      <li>My drier also came with the blue button on, but once I got it off, it worked great.</li>
      <li>It was fantastic and did everything it said that it should do, until tonight when I accidentally dropped it while drying my hair.</li>
      <li>According to my wife, even the the diffuser works fabulously.  </li>
      <li>With the Conair that I had bought, my hair never got smooth and strait.  </li>
      <li>So if your hair is IMPORTANT (like it is for me)</li>
      <li>This is a great product, if it can be quieter and smaller.</li>
      <li>I had been using a T3 for 6 years before this and the fan on this is MUCH more powerful than the T3 Featherweight.</li>
      <li>Overall, I rated four stars because although it isn&#x27;t perfect, I do really like the performance of this dryer.</li>
      <li>she absolutely loves it!!!  </li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with it and would highly recommend it to anyone with processed, frizzy hair.  </li>
      <li>This hair dryer is super strong and it has taken time off of my drying and styling.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Read is a beauty magazine about the wonders of this dryer.  They did not exaggerate at all.  It is very powerful, gets really hot, has a cool down button and works great.  I bought it a few years ago and it is still going strong.</li>
    <li> Well worth the money.  We always bought inexpensive hair dryers, but now can see the difference a professional model can make.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new dryer and spent some time online doing my research.  This product was generally well-liked so I spent the extra money and purchased it.  I&#x27;m not sure it is as overwhelmingly better than all others (that&#x27;s a tough claim), but I have to say that it is a pretty good product.  I have very thick color-treated blonde hair so I have to be careful not to damage it but yet I don&#x27;t want it to take all day to dry.  This dryer allows me to dry my hair very quickly and without damage.  I really like the difuser too.  It is a bit heavy but that isn&#x27;t a big deal since I don&#x27;t take it on trips and my arm doesn&#x27;t get too tired since it doesn&#x27;t take too long to dry.  Overall, I rated four stars because although it isn&#x27;t perfect, I do really like the performance of this dryer.</li>
    <li> I spent over $100 for a hairdryer.  I used it twice and had to return it because it had no heat.  I wasn&#x27;t impressed for over $100.</li>
    <li> My daughter recently bought this hair dryer and let me dry my hair with it.  It dryed my thick shoulder length hair in  a little over 5 minutes. I love it.  My hair has a little wave in it, in the wrong places, and this straightens that out if I use a wide round brush with it. It does get rid of the small amount of frizz I have.  My daughter has long, frizzy, thick hair and she found this dryer to dry quickley and smooth down her hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer from Amazon and used it for 5 minutes and the heating element went out and it only blew cold air.  I processed a return and got a second unit within a couple of days.  The second unit did EXACTLY the same thing.  Did not complete one drying before the heating element stopped.  This is a very poor quality dryer or a manufacturer with very poor quality control, either way I would never purchase another product from them.  Amazon has processed my return easily and quickly both times and I am now going to purchase another brand of professional dryer from Amazon.  Do not waste your money on this, other reviewers have had the same experience with the heating element not working.</li>
    <li> I love this blowdryer. I have a lot of thick hair and this blowdryer cuts my drying time in half! It&#x27;s great! It&#x27;s quieter than other blowdryers. I have used the diffuser, and like it; but I haven&#x27;t yet used the other (don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s it&#x27;s called).</li>
    <li> I spent a lot of time comparing the features and benefits of different hair dryers before buying this one. I have a Babyliss and like it, but wanted to try something new. I didn&#x27;t see a big difference initially, but when I used this and the Babyliss on alternate days, I was amazed at how quickly the FHI drys my hair. I can exercise in the morning before work because this cuts down the amount of time I need to get ready. It is lightweight and quiet, and I  hope that it lives up to its claim to have a longer life.</li>
    <li> I am a stylist and I went to an FHI hair show. At first I wasn&#x27;t feeling the price; after watching what it did to the hair models (especially ones with tightly coiled hair) I was hooked!!! I mostly deal with natural/afro/tightly coiled hair and I do agree with everybody about this dryer cutting your work in half! It gets even the kinkiest of hair almost straight with body and shine before I have to flat iron. I definately recommend this product. Infact, I&#x27;m about to buy another one for my home. YIPPEEEE!!! LOL</li>
    <li> I was very close to purchasing one of those T3 hairdryers but didn&#x27;t want to take my chances after reading that Amazon was perhaps an unauthorized seller of that product. I went ahead and decided on the FHI Heat Nano Salon Pro 2000 and I can honestly say that it was worth every penny. I was initially skeptical on its claims that it cuts drying time in half and maintains moisture but its true. I have type 3C hair - which is kinky yet delicate - and it straightened my hair like a dream. Not to mention that the motor is half as quiet as the any cheap drug store dryer. I would highly recommend The FHI Heat Nano Salon Pro 2000 to anyone wanting a quality hair dryer. It&#x27;s worth the investment</li>
    <li> After years of buying those low cost hairdryers that I knew were not helping my thick curly \\&quot;already dry\\&quot; hair, like another reviewer I started researching for the best one I could find and I knew it would be expensive.  Well, this one is absolutely worth every penny.  My hairstylist was using this dryer and it took 1/2 the time to dry my hair.  I love the extra long cord and the various settings.  It was a little heavy at first, compared to my old Vidal Sassoon but I quickly got used to it.  You will not be disappointed.  I&#x27;d purchase another one in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> This dryer is probably the best one on the market.  Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with it and would highly recommend it to anyone with processed, frizzy hair.  It&#x27;s worth the money just because of how much time it saves.  I have very long, colored, curly, Caucasian porous hair of medium thickness, and of course I fight nature by drying it straight.  It takes about fifteen minutes to dry it with the FHI dryer.  If I let my hair air-dry for a little while first, then it takes about eight minutes to dry it.  That&#x27;s impressive, because a standard dryer would take about 45 minutes to do the job.  I&#x27;m also impressed with how lightweight this dryer feels.  It&#x27;s comfortable to hold it by either the handle or the barrel, and the concentrator attachment stays on firmly and works very well.  I haven&#x27;t used the diffuser attachment, so I can&#x27;t comment on that.  The hot setting is extremely hot, so I use the warm setting, and the cold setting is surprisingly chilly and works great at setting the style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, for me personally, because I have very long hair that is thinner and more porous at the very ends, this dryer does not eliminate the need for the flat iron afterwards. For some of us with naturally fuzzy hair, it&#x27;s just not realistic to expect a dryer alone to make our hair completely silky and smooth.  This dryer does make my hair more smooth and shiny than my old Hot Tools ionic dryer was doing.  After using this dryer, my hair is soft, straight, and shiny, but still puffy at the ends and needs the flat iron.  I would not be able to wear my hair down after using the FHI dryer alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, flat ironing is faster and easier after using the FHI dryer than it was after using the Hot Tools ionic dryer.  The FHI dryer must do a great job of smoothing the hair follicle, because when I flat iron after using the dryer, the iron&#x27;s plates slide down the hair very easily; I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m tugging on my hair with the flat iron like I would if I were still using the old dryer. After drying and flat ironing, the result is what we all want: very smooth, very silky hair.  The FHI dryer alone doesn&#x27;t produce that result, but it should still get much of the credit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I&#x27;m in a huge hurry, it is possible to use only the FHI dryer, not the flat iron, then throw my hair into a style that hides the puffy ends, like a braid or a bun, and go out looking pretty good.  Doing so would be impossible with a different dryer.  So: five stars.  I reiterate that this dryer is worth the cost, and I think that every girl with frizzy hair deserves to own one.old dryer.

    <li> For all the reviewers who complained about cold air. Please press the blue cold air button once to enable hot air. My drier also came with the blue button on, but once I got it off, it worked great. The time I spend drying my hair has decrease considerably! This drier is very powerful and does a great job.</li>
    <li> My wife has very thick hair.  And she uses her dryer daily.  So she had to have a professional version.  The cheaper ones just burn out so quick with her.  She really likes this one &amp; it really really dries.  It takes her ALOT less time to dry her hair.</li>
    <li> This dryer works as well as everyone said it does. [...]. Definately a difference in the speed of drying your hair and how it looks afterwards. It is quiet and also a bit heavier to hold than other dryers I have used. The price I paid getting it on Amazon was at least $30 cheaper than what I saw it selling for in the stores. It is worth it...you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> The dryer works just fine but the switches are ill-designed. The switches are located in an awkward position.    First:  the blue \\&quot;cool\\&quot; button is where your fingers rest so when you are drying hair and easily rest your fingers on the cool button, you blast the dryer on the cool setting.  This is very annoying and you have to get used to not pressing this button.    Second:  in order to turn on /off the dryer and turn the setting to how you want, you have to get used to doing it from an awkward position in the back of the handle where your fingers are holding the dryer.  Once you get used to it, it&#x27;s not a big deal, but it&#x27;s constantly annoying trying to turn on/off the dryer from this position.    The power of the dryer is great; it&#x27;s powerful and the dryer works well but I wish the buttons were designed better so that I didn&#x27;t always hit the cool button and that the on/off switch were easier to turn the blower on and off.</li>
    <li> The heating element in this hair dryer stopped working after three uses. I am in a protracted effort to get a replacement, although from reading other reviews it does not appear that the replacement will be any better than the original. Do not buy this hair dryer! It is unreliable.</li>
    <li> Excellent dryer, shipped really fast.  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the dryer.  This is the first what you might say \\&quot;expensive\\&quot; dryer my wife and I have had in our 30 years of marriage.  It dry&#x27;s my hair quickly with a very powerful force that is concentrated on one area.  We are both quite pleased and have hopes that the dryer may out last us.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this blow dryer. Several years ago my old professional blow dryer died, and I ended up replacing it with the best that Walmart could provide. It seemed to have all the latest and greatest technology and bells and whistles (3 heat settings, cool button, 3 air speeds with ion, ceramic heat), but my hair just wasn&#x27;t getting dry. By the time my hair dried my scalp was soaked, and my hair was was still frizzy no matter how much anti-frizz hair product I used. I have what a hair professional termed \\&quot;textured\\&quot; hair. It&#x27;s thick, porous, dries slowly because it retains moisture, and tends to frizz.     This blow dryer dries my hair fast, straight, and my hair feels great. It takes half the time to actually get my hair dry now, and my scalp isn&#x27;t soaked afterwards. This blow dryer gives me the same results as my salon visits. Big revelation....not all blow dryers are alike.    This blow dryer is an investment, but thanks to the great reviews I was confident in giving it a try, and I&#x27;m so glad I did. It&#x27;s worth every penny in time savings, and I like my hair again, and I actually have a hair style.</li>
    <li> I had high expectations for this hair dryer and I am deceived. I bought it to replace my Babyliss hair dryer (dropped it too many times...) and preferred the Babyliss.     This Fhi hair dryer is a bit heavy, and it didn&#x27;t make my hair shiny and soft AT ALL. It didn&#x27;t even dry my hair faster than Babyliss, but I have to say I didn&#x27;t try it on at the highest setting, cause it looked to me wayyyyy too hot for my hair to handle without major damage.     I guess I&#x27;ll get used to it, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend someone else to buy it, not worth the price.</li>
    <li> Wife wanted \\&quot;good\\&quot; hair dryer.  I know nothing about them.  I poked around on the internet and read lots of reviews.  People were very positive about this brand and version.  It is a professional grade high quality dryer and she loves it.  She was not familiar with the brand previously.  The only thing to consider (and not a big deal) is that the power cord is longer than a typical home cord as it seems to true that this is used by professionals.  Not a big deal, but so you know it does not have a little curled up cord.</li>
    <li> Did a lot of research on blow dryers and settled on this one based on positive feedback.  Totally worth the money.  Dried my hair and made it a lot straighter than my old dryer and only took half the time!</li>
    <li> Like many others, I have always used cheap hair dryers from Target or the drug store and assumed most hair dryers were the same. My husband always complained about how loud they were and how long they ran for so he bought me the FHI Nano Pro for Valentine&#x27;s Day (in pink of course). It is amazing and so much more quiet! My thick hair dries in half the time and has much more sheen to it. It has also cut down on the amount of time to flat iron it and extended time between washes. I think I will be adding the FHI pro flat iron to my collection too! I would highly recommend it even thought it is more money than I ever thought I would pay for a hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas..... she absolutely loves it!!!  An excellent dryer for alot less money than other top dollar dryers.  Dries fast, and much quieter than other dryers.</li>
    <li> The first couple of times I dried my hair, it was nothing but a ball of frizz. I then dried it on the low heat setting. It wasn&#x27;t much better. Also, when I unplugged the dryer, the unit was very hot which makes me think it could be a safety hazard. I&#x27;m returning this dryer and getting another brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, when I spent over $100 on a hairdryer, I expected a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hairdryer did a great job, for about a year and a half.  It was used every day for a year and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pluses: Low, Medium, High Heat&lt;br /&gt;Cold Blast to set hair&lt;br /&gt;Low and medium setting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord is a HUGE problem.  It twists and tangles to the point of shorting out.  Had to replace the plug.</li>
    <li> I purchased the pink version 8 months ago and have been using it a few times a week since then. I love the look of it as pink is my favorite color. I had been using a T3 for 6 years before this and the fan on this is MUCH more powerful than the T3 Featherweight. Unfortunately the FH1 heating element died yesterday after 8 months of twice weekly use and I haven&#x27;t been able to revive it. The fan still works great but it&#x27;s blowing ice cold air so I can&#x27;t use it. Because I only use it a few times per week, I&#x27;m surprised that it had such a short lifespan. I will not be buying this brand again. It&#x27;s just too loud, too heavy, and too shortlived for me. I will be buying another T3 because I think it makes my hair blow out a bit smoother than other brands, including this one.</li>
    <li> Too powerful on high. Not powerful enough on other settings. Needs a additional setting. Extra features (nano technology, ion, etc.) do nothing to change the look or health of my hair. The diffuser doesn&#x27;t make my hair curly/wavy. (but the one on my old hair dryer did.) Going to try and return.</li>
    <li> I asked my hairdresser if dryers made a difference and she went on and on about the one she used- which is this one. She said she even takes it home evenings and weekends to use on her own hair. Bad news- it cost about $350! I wrote down the model and thought i would just see what I could find. I couldn&#x27;t believe it when I found it on here for under $100! I got it within three days of placing my order and tried it right away. It was truly amazing the difference it made with my hair. I have thinner hair with a natural wave so when it dries it dries more curly and frizzy so I usually use a round brush with a dryer to straighten and smooth it. With this dryer, it was shinier and smoother in half the time. I have been able to come close to how it looks when it is professionally blown out. For all those who don&#x27;t think a dryer makes a difference - I&#x27;m telling you this one did for me. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I have fine dry frizzy hair, not straight not wavy. I used cheap dryers before and was very skeptical that any expensive dryer can make any difference. But I was wrong, this dryer DOES make a difference. With FHI Heat Nano it takes me just under 5 minutes to dry my hair and as result my hair looks great: it gives volume (with no gels or mousses), remove frizz and make it straight (with no iron).   Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> delivery of product was timely and packaging was perfect.  Initially I loved the dryer as it had great power and the heat settings worked well.  However, after a month of using the dryer,  the heat  from the dryer just died.  I have never had a hair dryer be so short lived.  I absolutely do not recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome dryer! My hair stylist recommended it as it is the same line used in her salon.  Very effective and cuts down the time required for drying in half.  Could never go back now that I know what a better dryer feels like.</li>
    <li> I spent several weeks researching hair dryers before making this purchase.  This dryer was recommended to me by my hair stylist.  I have very thick hair with a slight wave (just enough to be annoying - not completely straight or curly) and was looking for a dryer that would cut down on frizz and dry time and just plain make it easier to dry my hair - this has done it all.  It is also very lightweight and much quieter than my previous Conair dryer.  Now to be honest, this is the first expensive dryer I have ever purchased so I can&#x27;t personally compare it to others out there on the market, but I read every review I could get my hands on before buying and I didn&#x27;t see any negatives where other expensive dryers (T3 for instance) seemed to have just as many unhappy customers as happy ones.  Even though it was quite expensive I don&#x27;t regret it one bit.  And, even though FHI won&#x27;t honor their warranty if you buy it from Amazon, Amazon will honor the manufacturer&#x27;s warranty.  It was much cheaper here.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have naturally wavy/slightly curly hair. This hair dryer seems to not damage my fine hair at all but leaves it feeling silky and lightweight. Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> I found it very hard to buy a blow dryer on line but after some research and talking with my hair stylist I decided to purchase the FHI Nano.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.  The best feature is the three heat options.  This dryer really does leave your hair looking silky and healthy.  You definately will see a big difference compared to the cheaper dryers.  If you need to replace your dryer this is worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best hair dryers I&#x27;ve ever had... I recommend it 100%, and it&#x27;s worth every penny!!!</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer ever!!!.. Cuts drying time by at least half, and if there is moisture in the air, you hair will never know about it.  Appretiate some of the other user reviews which were dead on. Its a pretty fast dryer so you need to work fast when styling with a brush.</li>
    <li> I am a professional hair stylist and swear by this blow dryer. I have a lot of naturally curly clients who like their hair straight. This blow dryer is perfect for me and their hair. Can&#x27;t imagine life w/o it.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is really good. I only gave ot 3 stars bcs I think it would work better for me if I was not doing my own hair. Its kind of hard to manipulate. However it does get my coarse African American hair dry and semi straight quickly. I wish I could use it the way my beautician does bcs Im sure my hair would be straighter w/ just this blow dryer bcs it is top of the line.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer.  I won this dryer from FHI many years ago and swore that I would never pay over $100 for a hair dryer. Well, my old dryer FHI Heat Nano Pro 2000(the dark gray) passed away recently.  I went to a department store, bought a Conair which cost $22 on sale, came home and washed and dried my hair then, I cried.  I have naturally curly, course hair that frizzes.  I need a dryer with high heat, and this dryer gets extremely hot, to straighten and calm the frizz. I wouldn&#x27;t say this dryer dries your hair faster but I can dry my hair and make it smooth and strait much faster than a cheaper dryer. With the Conair that I had bought, my hair never got smooth and strait.  I had to first dry then use a straigting iron to get the same result as drying with the FHI Pro2000. So the FHI saves me half the time.  Again, this dryer works so well with hard to manage hair. It does get extremely hot so make sure that you have a good, quality round brush that can sustain the heat.</li>
    <li> This dryer dries my thick, frizzy hair quickly and it comes out looking smooth and silky.  The only complaint I have is the placement of the temperature control switch (hot/warm/cold).  It&#x27;s just above the on/off switch and it&#x27;s very easy to inadvertently change the temperature when you&#x27;re just trying to turn the dryer on and off.  Otherwise, I really like the dryer and my hair comes out great.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, if it can be quieter and smaller. it will be an even better item for home users.</li>
    <li> Normally it takes me 1/2 hour to dry my long hair, but now only 15 minuites with this FHI 2000 hair dryer. Also, my hair is silky to the touch afterward.  The weigh of this dryer I feel a little bit heavy at first, but it&#x27;s solid.  I bought this dryer in pink color before, and this black one is for my sister as X&#x27;mas gift.  I hope she will like it as much as I do.  Great service from Amazon.  Fast delivery-about a week.  Nice packaging-no damage at all.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I bought 2 FHI Heat Nano Salon Pro 2000 w/ Nano Fuzeion.  One was a gift.  I used mine and it&#x27;s great!  I have dry frizzy hair and it&#x27;s the first dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned that made my hair straight, soft and shiny with little effort.  My daughter thought I used a straightener. I highly recommend it - it&#x27;s well worth the cost!</li>
    <li> Bought this 7 months ago and used it a few times a week. The heating element just went out. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I ordered this hair dryer because of the fabulous reviews it received. It was fantastic and did everything it said that it should do, until tonight when I accidentally dropped it while drying my hair. Something inside of it broke and pieces of the dryer started shooting out. It also had a horrible burning smell. It is now beyond repair and I need to purchase a new dryer. I have dropped many a hair dryer in the past and nothing like this has ever happened. I know that dropping it isn&#x27;t good, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to break into pieces like it did. If you do decide to get this dryer be careful not to ever drop it!</li>
    <li> I had the same problem as other reviews. After the first use, the dryer stopped blowing hot air. Such a disappointment. Especially since the one time I used it, it did an amazing job.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this dryer on me, and I was amazed at the short length of time that it took to blowdry out my natural curly hair straight. Not only did it cut the time in half but it looked very shiny and healthy also! I got the name of the dryer from him and immediately did a search online to find it - and Amazon definitely has the best price out there!  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it is quite an expensive dryer. But in my eyes it is a worthwhile investment worth every single penny of the price!</li>
    <li> I have fine texture, naturally wavy, but very thick hair.  My stylist marvels at how long it takes her to dry my hair.  This hair dryer is super strong and it has taken time off of my drying and styling.  (I am considering bringing it to my next hair appt. for her to try.)  My hair has never been this soft from a hair dryer before.   Other than wanting funky, jagged texture sometimes, I have stopped using my flat iron!  It also gives my hair volume, despite the wonderful softness.  I am very happy with this hair dryer, although I still feel guilty for spending so much.      I have justified the cost to myself because I am expecting and HATE blow drying my hair.  I don&#x27;t want to be \\&quot;that\\&quot; wife/mom/woman who lives in a ponytail after the baby is born.  Honestly, with this hair dryer I am far more likely to style my hair.    Oh, and last thing.  My hair is always greasy the second day after washing.  IF there is any oil I run the dryer and brush through my dry hair and it looks as good as the first day.  I am able to wash my hair every two - three days without feeling self-conscious.  That was NEVER the case before.  I used to use powder in the roots of my hair the second day. Not anymore!      Bottom line, if you are willing to spend the money, I would highly recommend this hair dryer.  IMHO, it really does make a difference.</li>
    <li> Like the first reviewer, I also did a great deal of research prior to making my purchase. If you&#x27;re going to spend an obscene amount of money on a hair dryer, it better do what it claims. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this one. It dries my hair in less than half the time and my hair looks at least twice as good than with my old $20 conair.    I have very fine, wavy, hair, and I have alot of it. It always took a very long time to dry, and nothing I tried ever seemed to tame the frizz. This hair dryer has made a huge difference! It&#x27;s a little heavier than my old one, but I don&#x27;t have to hold it as long, and the results are fantastic. No more frizz!    It&#x27;s quite a bit of money to spend on a hair dryer, but the results I achieve with it, and without having to use any styling products, is completely worth the cost.</li>
    <li> This was a mistake. This blower yes is way too I tense without a Tuvalu Ron g anything g. It did leave my hair a. It soften and smoother, however the motor is loud and powerful and blokes everywhere. This BD failed after a few months and warranty is not valid if ordered through amazon..:/</li>
    <li> I love the dryer, although the color is all black, not silver.  Either way, it gives a silky smooth blow dry.</li>
    <li> I was going to buy a Babyliss but i ordered this one. It was a mistake since it is more expensive and it didnt last long. Now it takes forever to dry. I had many customers complain about it.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: I&#x27;ve owned this for over 1.5 years, use it approx every other day and it still works like brand new. Glad I don&#x27;t have that conair or revlon crap anymore. I plan on updating this review every couple of years. I hope it lasts for years and years!      This hair dryer is amazing! I can&#x27;t speak long term, I&#x27;ve only had it a short time, but I will say that I am NEVER going to buy a different dryer again. I have medium thick hair that air dries naturally puffy and frizzy with some curl. It used to take 15 min to blow dry my hair, and my hair was still pretty frizzy and puffy. Not anymore! I can dry my hair in 7 min and my hair looks almost as tho I&#x27;ve straightened it with a flat iron. I still flat iron it but if I don&#x27;t i&#x27;m not embarrassed, I can actually leave my house. Also, this dryer&#x27;s cool shot feature is amazing, feels like air conditioning. The dryer is half as loud as any others I&#x27;ve used. A really great buy/investment. You won&#x27;t be disappointed, you&#x27;ll be in love!</li>
    <li> I had this dryer for 4 yrs and used it professionally!!!!  That&#x27;s why I decided to order another!  Love it!</li>
    <li> THIS DRYER BLOWS LIKE HURRICANE KATRINA! ALL OVER THE PLACE. I AM GETTING USED TO IT, BUT HAD I KNOWN THIS I WOULD NOT HAVE SPENT THE MONEY ON IT.&lt;br /&gt;I HAD A GREAT DRYER FROM THE SHARPER IMAGE. IT WAS THE BEST DRYER. LASTED ME 13 YEARS!!!!!! I CAN ONLY HOPE THIS THING LASTS WITH A PRICE TAG LIKE THAT!!!!&lt;br /&gt;DISAPPOINTED</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but worth every penny, it seems. Has an extra long cord. I don&#x27;t know what all the fancy technological issues are but when my wife says \\&quot;I love it\\&quot; it gets five stars. The cheap hair dryers we used to buy would work for a few months then die - this one seems to be made to last for years.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer did everything they said it would do. My hair looks like I stepped out of the salon with that salon finish everyday! It is shiny like they said it would be and it is not damaging to my hair at all. This is a great blow dryer for someone to use in their home once or twice a day but I would not recommend this blowdryer for salon use because it does start to feel a little heavy after a few minutes so I couldent see a stylist holding this dryer for 8 hrs a day which is unfortunate cause it is a GREAT dryer!!</li>
    <li> I can dry my hair in half the time on \\&quot;warm\\&quot; and my hair looks so much more healthy and shiny...no more dry and frizzy hair. I have thick slightly wavy hair that seems to get wavier as I age. This hairdryer is absolutely worth the extra $$.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer has worked wonders. I am in the process of transitioning from relaxed to natural and this product creates lovely results. Leaves hair straight with a lovely sheen. Also, it takes maybe 5-10 minutes to dry hair!</li>
    <li> I like this hair dryer a lot.  It does dry my hair faster and it is quieter compared to my old 30 dollar dryer.  The only con is that it is heavier than my old dryer.  I&#x27;m a little concerned about how it was packaged.  It looks like the item was opened and then repackaged.  Each piece inside the box was repackaged and closed with twisty ties.  Hopefully I won&#x27;t have any problems with it and it will last.  I would recommend this dryer to anyone who has thick hair and a lot of it!</li>
    <li> I love this blow dryer...it gets my hair dried fast and has different temperature settings and even a cool blast button.  For those going natural this is a great choice!!</li>
    <li> I love this Hair dryer! It&#x27;s light and powerful and it has lasted me a long time. It has a long cord and came with the accessories I needed.  So much better than the T3.</li>
    <li> This is a great hairdryer at a really amazing price! You can buy it lots of other places for $279.00, so at $86.00 it&#x27;s a real deal.  It has all the power of the CHI Rocket but is less clunky.  Someone mentioned that the controls were in an awkward place, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the position of the controls at all. And I like the \\&quot;one-touch\\&quot; cool shot - you don&#x27;t have to hold the button down to get cool air.  One push and it&#x27;s cool, another and it&#x27;s hot again. You can&#x27;t get a hairdryer like this except at a beauty supply store - the ones they sell at drugstores, department stores, etc. just don&#x27;t have the heat or the power. This a truly professional, high-end hairdryer. I absolutely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I purchased the FHI Heat Nano Salon Pro 2000 six months ago, and it was love at first blowdry. During high school and college, I owned a series of inexpensive, low quality hair dryers. Yes, after half an hour or more and some expletives, they did dry my hair, but it was always flat and without shine. I blamed my hair, rather than the hair dryers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the warm heat setting and high fan setting, this FHI hair dryer gives me soft, voluminous waves in less than fifteen minutes. I never knew my hair could look so beautiful and healthy! I blow dry it immediately after every morning shower, and I use [[ASIN:B004461ZL4 Sedu Anti-Frizz Polishing Treatment with Argan Oil, 6.8 oz. bottle]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I almost forgot! The first time I turned it on, I thought I had received a defective model like some of the other reviewers. But I had accidentally pressed the blue \\&quot;cold shot\\&quot; button found on the inside of the hair dryer handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (after one year): I still love this hair dryer, and it&#x27;s working just as well as the day I purchased it.</li>
    <li> Excellent!  Awesome!  Takes half the time to dry your long and/or thick hair.  I get compliments every time I use this, and that was starting from the first time I used it.  What more do you want from a dryer?  Worth every penny.  To me its quiet and does not weigh any more than a regular dryer.  Invest in yourself, especially if you feel your hair has to be perfect everytime you step out the door.  So if your hair is IMPORTANT (like it is for me) then this is the one you want to buy.  Don&#x27;t even hesitate -- get it you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> Cuts drying time significantly</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is exactly what I was looking for in a blow dryer.  I am African American, with type 3c hair and no matter what I do my hair looks amazing.  I can use the diffuser to let my hair remain curly, get a soft sheen and elongated looser curls that what I would get if I let my hair air dry.  I also use the diffuser when I coil, shingle or put my hair in rods or curlers to achieve lengthen my curls and freshen them up daily when I wake up.    Besides using the dryer for curly styles, I use it the straighten my hair and the results I get are simply silky.  I glide a brush through my hair and it straightens all the frizz out of my hair.  Also the dryer get my hair so smooth that I can glide my flat iron through my hair in a matter of minutes to complete styling.  On hot days in the summer, I used the dryer to touch up my roots to help keep my hair straight.      As a plus, this is the quietest blow dryer I&#x27;ve ever used. The highest setting I use is warm with low heat although I occasionally use the warm heat setting with the high fan.  I haven&#x27;t needed to even try hot with the low or high fan, yet, but I can say that warm dries shoulder length hair in about 15 minutes or so. I could not give this product a higher review.  I&#x27;ve tried my share of dryers and nothing works like this.  definitely worth the money since I can get professional results at home.  It saves me tons of money since I don&#x27;t have to go to the salon as often.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted a new, -proper- hairdryer for Christmas, she did her research, and sent me this link.  She loved it as a gift, and I have to say, it&#x27;s easily the best, most effective hairdryer I&#x27;ve ever used.  She&#x27;s blown away (heh) by just how well it works for her!  I notice how much faster it dries my hair; how powerful &amp; well-focused the air blast is; how reasonably well-balanced it is; the optimal placement of the controls; the built-in velcro strap to bind the cord when storing; the little ring on the handle to hang the dryer on a hook; the push-button &#x27;cold blast&#x27; heater cut-out button - which latches on or off! - and even the rubber bumper dots on the sides (to cushion the dryer when it&#x27;s set down on it&#x27;s side on the countertop), all these are signs of a professional, proven, iterated design that is a flat-out excellent example of form-following-function design.  According to my wife, even the the diffuser works fabulously.  She raves about this dryer whenever I ask her about it, and says it has made a big difference in the ease of styling and managing her hair - and since I can see the results, I agree!  One of the best gifts I&#x27;ve given her in a long time, and I get to enjoy it too in multiple ways. I can&#x27;t speak to the dryer&#x27;s long-term reliability as yet, but IMO it&#x27;s pricey but oh-so-worth it - you won&#x27;t go wrong snapping up one of these!</li>
