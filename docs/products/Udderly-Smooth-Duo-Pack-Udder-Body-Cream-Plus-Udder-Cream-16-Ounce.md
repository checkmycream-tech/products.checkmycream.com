      <li>This didn&#x27;t do anything special.</li>
      <li>Is as good as the one my wife bought locally.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t like super oily lotion.</li>
      <li>Arrived Quickly.  </li>
      <li>This cream is beyond moisturizing and absorbs quickly into the skin;</li>
      <li>and it was delivered quickly.  </li>
      <li>Works good to soften my dry skin on hands.</li>
      <li>Goes on and is absorbed quickly.</li>
      <li>recommend and will be back for more another time!</li>

      <li>Udder Cream does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
      <li>Love it and will keep using it daily to survive the Maine winters!</li>
      <li>Smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no oily residue, and the smell is okay, and it feels moisturizing for a couple of minutes after putting it on, but the feeling doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
      <li>This lotion not only smells nice (not strong but nice)</li>
      <li>It is a bit thin for rides beyond 100 miles, butt :) the tube tucks nicely into a jersey pocket.</li>
      <li>I can pretty much do anything I want to do after rubbing it in.  </li>
      <li>I love this cream, It has cleared up all my dry areas.</li>

      <li>It goes on smooth, not greasy or oily, and within minutes your skin feels hydrated and fresh without being wet or clogged.</li>

      <li>Has repeatedly cleared up patches of exema on my very sensitive skin.</li>

      <li>so i decide to try it its soft and aesy to apply and made in</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, soaks in fast and evenly and appears to last all day.</li>
      <li>It absorbs completely and leaves no residue</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This didn&#x27;t do anything special. Its just lotion</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  It is scent free and does a great job.</li>
    <li> non greasy,  makes my ol&#x27; 69 year old working hands soft</li>
    <li> works great .have used for years.</li>
    <li> I especially like the cream in the tub because it is odorless.  Great stuff!!</li>
    <li> I had heard of this lotion/salve elsewhere &amp; decided to see if Amazon carried it.  I got both kids as shown.  They are the same lotion in different packaging.  I use the jar in my bedroom before bed or when i wake to add moisture to my legs.  They are dry. In winter now they get dry and the itch comes. i&#x27;m also trying to preserve the elasticity of the skin.  This lotion not only smells nice (not strong but nice) it soothes and heals.  It&#x27;s not greasy, soaks in fast and evenly and appears to last all day. i&#x27;ve been using it awhile now and decided to leave feedback based on usage.  There is no after-film and overcoat like some lotions or greases have.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend and will be back for more another time!</li>
    <li> This is wonderful. Love it. I have used it for years. Udder Cream does exactly what it says it will do. But since  I can no longer find it at my local &amp;#34;giant&amp;#34; retailers, even though they claim to have it in stock (the clerk at one big chain drug store had no idea what I was talking about)  So I now buy it from Amazon.  We have friends in the medical field who highly recommend Udder Cream.</li>
    <li> Best body cream ever! Has repeatedly cleared up patches of exema on my very sensitive skin. When nothing else would work, Udderly Smooth performed a miracle. Skin stays soft for so long after you apply it, and it smells mild and clean. I just love this stuff. I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough!</li>
    <li> My daughter absolutely loved Udder cream and swears by it.  She has dry skin and she said it relieves her discomfort.</li>
    <li> I live in New York and during the winter, the weather + the heat in my apt can cause my skin to be very dry. I work as a nurse and I am constantly washing my hands adding on to the problem of my dry hands. Sometimes my hands are so dry they develop cuts. Udder cream was recommending by my co-worker who has experience in wound care. I been using udder cream for years. I buy a package and place one in every room. The best thing about this cream is 1) it is light 2) dries fast and 3) doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
    <li> I bought this a month ago and applied it almost everyday. My skin does not feel dry anymore. Good product!</li>
    <li> I love it and keep ordering it.  Smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> Works good to soften my dry skin on hands.</li>
    <li> i saw this on the tv show how its made so i decide to try it its soft and aesy to apply and made in ohio USAof course thank you.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. I use it to desensitize my skin as a result of medical treatment. Works great!  Good service too...didn&#x27;t take long to receive the product.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years.  It works well.</li>
    <li> I use this in place of expensive creams marketed for applying to bike shorts chamois. Works well and washes out easily.</li>
    <li> Besides the clever yet funny name, this cream is a God sent esp. in the cold winter months!  I loved the duo pack b/c I use the tub at home for after the shower &amp; the tube for work for my dry hands.  This cream is beyond moisturizing and absorbs quickly into the skin; no greasy feel afterwards.</li>
    <li> Great cream for an incredible value.  I got it as a gift for my aunt and she absolutely loves it.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Really helps my chapped hands  in cold weather without feeling greasy.  I can pretty much do anything I want to do after rubbing it in.  Better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes without the greasiness of other heavy coverage lotions. It doesn&#x27;t have a perfume scent so that is a plus also.</li>
    <li> The price was very good and it was delivered quickly.  I liked Udderly Smooth because it makes my skin feel real soft and I would purchase it again.  I recommend this product to others with dry skin.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my dry flaking skin.  No oily residue and odor free. Great product!</li>
    <li> I use it on my chamois. It is the easiest to clean up product I&#x27;ve used. It is a bit thin for rides beyond 100 miles, butt :) the tube tucks nicely into a jersey pocket.</li>
    <li> this stuff is great non greasy</li>
    <li> Does better than many higher priced itms.</li>
    <li> After a few applications, I could feel the beginning of softness in my hands and feet.</li>
    <li> Love this product  because it isn&#x27;t t greasy. Can&#x27;t always find it in the store so I was happy to find it at amazon.</li>
    <li> use it daily, like it very much.</li>
    <li> I used this after going to the beach, and fell in love with it! It isn&#x27;t greasy, and my skin didn&#x27;t peel like it usually does.</li>
    <li> BEST STUFF EVER USE IT ALL YEAR LONG</li>
    <li> Works just as described, moisturizes but does not leave skin greasy.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! It makes my skin feel smooth and hydrated.</li>
    <li> The best lotion on the market</li>
    <li> I love this cream, It has cleared up all my dry areas. It&#x27;s great stuff!</li>
    <li> I took ceramics this term and really needed a heavy duty moisturizer. This stuff might be okay for everyday use, but not for restoring moisture into your hands. There&#x27;s no oily residue, and the smell is okay, and it feels moisturizing for a couple of minutes after putting it on, but the feeling doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> Works really good for particular skin malady.</li>
    <li> Have used this stuff for years because it doesn&#x27;t stain the fabric, I do Hardanger embroidery and use Belfast linen (expensive!!) and definitely do NOT want funky marks, because as gross as it may sound, everyone&#x27;s hands sweat at some point. This will not leave any kind of stain or mark on your fabric and ruin hours, days, even months of work on a project. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, hard to find it at a reasonable price in the store.</li>
    <li> Great price, I have new scars and I use the cream to soften the scar tissue. The body cream is great.</li>
    <li> this is great for your hands or any place that is extremely dry.  We even used it on our dog who has some dry areas on his skin and it worked.  His hair is regrowing!!</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite lotion cream! It absorbs completely and leaves no residue and I actually feel like my skin has been moisturized. I used to buy it at Walgreens but my store stopped carrying it and I had to turn to AMAZON.</li>
    <li> This is simply the best hand cream for people who wash or gel their hands all the time in a healthcare setting.</li>
    <li> Arrived Quickly.  Soothing cream.</li>
    <li> Great Lotion! Leaves my skin so soft!</li>
    <li> I like this cream. Not greasy. I have dry skin but I don&#x27;t like super oily lotion. I use this without thinking about being shiny or ruining my cloth  I am impatient so waiting for any lotion to absorb into my body is not my thing so this is perfect. I will order it again</li>
    <li> this is great stuff and I&#x27;ll be purchasing more of it. leaves you skin feeling udderly smooth :)</li>
    <li> this lotion actually came recommended by nurse for my mother who is undergoing chemo and radiation treatments.  The treatments make their skin VERY dry and this lotion is supposed to be gentle, yet moisture rich enough to handle the rigor of the treatments.  My mom loves the lotion and the fact that the smells do not upset her.  Thank you for selling and creating this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Goes on and is absorbed quickly. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Yu can use it daily as a moisturizer, or as a hand cream.&lt;br /&gt;Love the no fragrance factor.&lt;br /&gt;You can also find it at the Dollar store in California on occasion.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t like oily topical lotions/creams... This works great!  I love how soft my skin feels after application. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am a cyclist and I use Udderly Smooth as my chamois crème.  Works great.</li>
    <li> Arrived in timely manner.  Is as good as the one my wife bought locally.</li>
    <li> I do like this cream, and agree with all previous reviews. Has pleasant smell, leaves your hand smooth and silky, and body cream is not greasy , easy applies, dries quick, but a bit pricey here. Another day found it at local Wal-Mart store the jar cream for less then $4...</li>
    <li> This is the best inexpensive hand cream out there. It was originally given to me as a gift by my boss at a horse stable. It goes on smooth, not greasy or oily, and within minutes your skin feels hydrated and fresh without being wet or clogged. Love it and will keep using it daily to survive the Maine winters! ~.^</li>
