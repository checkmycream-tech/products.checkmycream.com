      <li>I love it more than shimmering lights and its cheaper!</li>
      <li>This has worked by far the best of all toners I have tried.</li>
      <li>Now in my 50&#x27;s, I decided to &#x27;go natural&#x27; and hope for the best.  </li>
      <li>And since it is very fine, the hairdressers do not like to always bleach through to the bottoms of my medium to longer length hair.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say I love one more than another, and this is a nice one.</li>
      <li>I find that the more it is used the more effective it is.</li>
      <li>It was suppose to be a very light blond.</li>
      <li>This is a nice shampoo - not too strong</li>
      <li>There is no terrible smell to this shampoo, it does not stain my hands, rinses out like any &#x27;normal&#x27; shampoo, and my silver hair stays bright and shiny!</li>
      <li>do have more fun!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT :)</li>
      <li>Please invest in a better product because it won&#x27;t do anything.</li>
      <li>i love it</li>
      <li>One of my favorite shampoos ever.</li>
      <li>i love the smell.</li>

      <li>and i would have to say that I absolutely love this product</li>
      <li>and I was pleased with the price.</li>
      <li>but i wasnt in love with the color</li>
      <li>I am pleased with the results.</li>

      <li>:)</li>

      <li>SO GLAD</li>
      <li>Several reviewers said it smelled wonderful - perhaps if you want to smell like Carmen Miranda.</li>
      <li>but I think after using it for a while longer, I&#x27;ll have a more informed opinion</li>
      <li>What more could you ask for?  </li>
      <li>I love my hair and the shine this shampoo gives</li>
      <li>Make sure you have a good conditioner, since it can be pretty drying, but all toners are.  </li>
      <li>and it is excellent and a bottle lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>First thing my hair was not doing good since I had highlights</li>
      <li>so I think it might be best for those who want to correct light to moderate brassiness.  </li>
      <li>I honestly cannot say enough great things about this product.</li>
      <li>My hair is now a lovely light to medium &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; ash brown.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Exactly as described. Fast shipper.</li>
    <li> Works very well for my graying hair. Does not dry it out, but leaves it soft and even brings back someof the natural curl I used to have.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good shampoo and keep blond hair from getting yellow tone. But do not expect to correct the color after bleaching if you get yellow or orange result. Other than that it works.</li>
    <li> I use my shampoo 3 times weekly. The best thing about it is the way it makes my hair shine. It brightens up the silver and grey and makes it very pretty. I find that the more it is used the more effective it is. The shipment came with time to spare and  was well packed. I will definitely order agin, when I get near the end of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon and vendors,&lt;br /&gt;J Parrott</li>
    <li> First off, this is not a toner like the other review says.  This does not tone(darken) hair down into a cool blonde like an actual toner does.  It makes hair platinum, especially if you let it sit for 15 minutes.  It definitely works just up to the level of shimmer lights by clairol, and is less expensive.</li>
    <li> Smells good but it does nothing more than a regular shampoo.  I&#x27;m going to stick with Shimmering Lights.</li>
    <li> Must have for silver hair -  totally eliminates any yelloeing</li>
    <li> Not necessarily for blonde or silver hair only. I would have given this product 5 stars and will explain in a moment why I did not. So, my (hopefully) quick hair dying story. My natural color is light to medium ash brown. I&#x27;d recently had my hair dyed for an event I was to attend. I went to my local salon and chose a light ash brown ( supposedly ) and made it very clear to the stylist that I wanted 0, none, nada warm tones ( aka brassy, orange and yellow highlights ) Of course that&#x27;s exactly what I ended up with. I will say they were not terrible and only seemed to be visible in the sun light or under certain florescent bulbs. Either way, if you are anything like me then even that little bit is a little bit too much. It turns out the event I was to attend was canceled so I did not find myself in a &amp;#34;Hair Emergency&amp;#34; but I still wanted it fixed. I started looking into toners ( which I know NOTHING about) and accidently stumbled onto a recommendation for the Jhirmack Silver Plus. After some thought I decided to give it a try ( I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt given that&#x27;s its only a shampoo ) and I wanted to do as little damage as possible......I&#x27;ve been down that road before and no desire to revisit. I read this product works very well at removing unwanted orange yellow tones. So I ordered it.........Wow.......I don&#x27;t know how well this would work for someone who&#x27;s hair is completely orange or yellow but I can state that it worked great for my hair that had minimal unwanted brassy tones. The reason I gave this product 4 instead of 5 stars is because it did lighten my hair a bit ( which I am thrilled with because it had come out to dark anyways.....kind of like a bonus ) so for me......5 star product........however, if you do not want any lighting then I cant say I would recommend this shampoo. The directions read to shampoo and leave in for 2 minutes. I shampooed and left in for 5 minutes and then repeated the processes. The first shampoo session got rid of about 85% of those nasty highlights. It took 2 more times of 5 minute sessions to completely remove all traces. My hair is now a lovely light to medium &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; ash brown. Hope this review was helpful to those of you wondering if this product can be used on darker  hair. Note: I think it is also worth mentioning that for a cheap drug store shampoo this stuff leaves your hair feeling very soft and moisturized ( I have naturally wavy, coarse, thick dry hair ).......in fact, it may very well be the best store bought shampoo I have ever used and even better some of the salon shampoos I have purchased over the years.....this is coming from a person who almost never uses cheap anything when it comes to hair, skin and make-upof those nasty highlights. It took 2 more times of 5 minute sessions to completely remove all traces. My hair is now a lovely light to medium &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; ash brown.

    <li> I used this shampoo for the first time and what I felt:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  It made my hair softer.&lt;br /&gt;2)  After I got out the shower usually it is really hard for me to brush my hair since its all tangled. But after this shampoo, it was not as hard as it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair color:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have highlights, when I used this shampoo for the first time:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  I did not see any major difference in color as everybody said.&lt;br /&gt;2)  My hair color was a little bit on the honey color side than pure silver.&lt;br /&gt;3)  It definitely did not make my hair look yellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 weeks...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  I still don&#x27;t have the silver color I wanted, but the honey color is lighter and it looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;2)  The reason it looks natural is because my hair color feels like its layered with this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use this shampoo everyday...only once a week. Maybe that is why I did not see a color change the way I wanted, but other shampoos gave me the effect I wanted but destroyed the integrity of my hair. I will definitely keep using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have highlights over my natural darker reddish blonde hair so in the summer the red can tend to make the highlights slightly more golden than I would like. I bought this shampoo last minute before vacation because it was the only purple toner shampoo my local drugstore offered and I was pleased with the price. Overall the shampoo works well as a toner and has prevented golden tones, forms a nice lather, and is not overly drying. I will definitely keep using! On a side note however this shampoo  WILL NOT FIX a bad dye job. If you have brassy orangey hair from a dye job gone wrong no toner shampoo will fix it. If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for this product is not for you.</li>
    <li> didnt tone a single bit, used it several times, bottles almost empty, it seriously did NOTHING!!!!!!! TOTAL RIP OFF CRAP!!!!!</li>
    <li> Good shampoo does what it says it does</li>
    <li> My wife is very pleased with this shampoo, don&#x27;t know why, but she thinks it&#x27;s great! Is the only shampoo she will use.</li>
    <li> Works better than most salon shampoos for silver hair.  Very good purchase. Good value for the price.  Will re-order when needed.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year now and it is excellent and a bottle lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I honestly cannot say enough great things about this product. I purchased it because I have several blonde highlights in my chocolate brown hair. I always have trouble with blonde pieces becoming brassy just a few weeks after I have my color done. Just a few days after I started using this product I noticed that that pieces of hair that started becoming brassy werr getting lighter again and looked more blonde than orange just like I wanted. I will continue to purchase this shampoo and use it on a regular basis to keep my brown hair and be lighter brown and blonde pieces from turning orange. Also- the trick is to keep the shampoo sitting in your hair for a couple of minutes instead of rinsing right away after you lather it into your hair.</li>
    <li> I recently bleached my hair and It turned bright yellow. After one use of this product, the brassiness has been toned way down. I&#x27;m hoping that, with continued use, I will end up with a much more pleasing color!mi would definitely recommend this shampoo!</li>
    <li> I used Pantene silver expressions until it was discontinued and have been on a silver shampoo replacement for months!! THIS is the closest I&#x27;ve come! it doesn&#x27;t color your hands and therefore I feel it doesn&#x27;t color my hair which I DO NOT want! My hair is white and I want to keep it that way! It also smells nice and is very inexpensive as a bonus! Its also carried by my local walmart! Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I usually use Clairol&#x27;s Shimmer Lights to keep my blonde hair bright &amp; brass-free. I had been hearing a lot about Jhirmack so I decided to give it a try. It worked well, but not quite as well as Shimmer Lights (because I don&#x27;t think it is as pigmented) I will say it seems cheaper than Shimmer Lights, and it doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as bad. So if you can&#x27;t get any Shimmer Lights, this shampoo is a worthy replacement.</li>
    <li> I dyed my black hair to a medium golden brassy blonde...which was definitely not the color that I was going for. Today, I bought Jhirmack Silver Plus Shampoo from the local CVS in town. At home, tested it by washing my hair with the product and leaving it in for 2 minutes. When I washed out the product and towel dryed my hair, I noticed that my hair was a lot more golden and a lot less brassy.  I repeated the process of washing my hair again. This time I left the product in my hair for 10 minutes. Then I rinsed my hair and noticed that my hair was a lot less orange-brassy and that the product gave me an even tone throughout my uneven dye job. Now, I look like a natural dirty blonde! Yay!</li>
    <li> I have frosted hair. And since it is very fine, the hairdressers do not like to always bleach through to the bottoms of my medium to longer length hair. So with that, added to the elements of sun and not the best water, this helps to keep those highlights bright and shiny, and rid my hair of that &amp;#34;yellowing&amp;#34; color. I would recommend using this about two to three times per week, depending on the environmental hazards you personaly deal with. I would recommend this product to get rid of that dull, fading look. And it&#x27;s a great price for what it does to help.</li>
    <li> Infinitely more gentle on hair than other purple shampoos and a much more pleasant scent, but I haven&#x27;t seen as dramatic a brightening effect as I was hoping.</li>
    <li> this product is great if you bleach or go blonde at home it takes the brassy color out and maintains the blonde color long than other color shampoos.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do! Definitely takes the orange out of my hair but does dry my hair out a lot.... So make sure to follow with a good conditioner. I usually use argan oil conditioner and it works fine. Typically will use 2-3x a week depending on if I will style my hair.</li>
    <li> I bleached my hair and it turned a very yellow blonde. I was hoping this would take the yellow away but it hasn&#x27;t no matter how long I keep it on. I think this is meant for people who are already blonde and want to keep yellow away. It turns very white when lathered so I knew it wasn&#x27;t going to drastically take away the yellow :/</li>
    <li> I llike that it is for grey/white hair &amp; it suds well. Local stores do not handle it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert Creasey</li>
    <li> I bought this to tone down the yellow in my bleached blonde hair. It did absolutely nothing for my brassiness. In fact, I noticed it seemed to dry my hair out.</li>
    <li> After several uses, I saw a noticeable difference in my platinum blonde hair. Much more white and much less yellow-y</li>
    <li> I use this in between shampoos for my highlighted hair. It removes any of the buildup that dulls my hair and keeps my hair looking fresh and shiny. A good product and at a great price.</li>
    <li> Finally got rid of the yellow shade from my bleached hair. Love it!</li>
    <li> Well, I haven&#x27;t even used it, and probably will not, because it smells very fruity - YECCH. Several reviewers said it smelled wonderful - perhaps if you want to smell like Carmen Miranda. Me, I really hate fruity-smelling toiletries.</li>
    <li> bought &amp;#34;Silver Plus&amp;#34; in order to get the yellow out of a seniors grey hair. Used it four times without any results. good luck</li>
    <li> I decided to let my hair go gray and not color it.  I read other reviews on this product, and saw it had good reviews. It does seem to make my hair less yellow.</li>
    <li> I love it more than shimmering lights and its cheaper! Keeps my hair from turning brassy! Def will buy again!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t order from Amazon this time, I drove myself on over to Walgreens to see what they charge now 1/2014, they are charging 5.99 for it, they used to sell it for just over three dollars. So I picked it up while I was there getting a prescription, I live 20 miles from the closest Walgreens so I had to wait until I was going into town. That makes the shipping on this about four bucks, I can drive over cheaper than that, but I will keep this in mind...if they had subscribe and save which I do a lot of for the 20 percent off plus free shipping, I would certainly add this item to it!</li>
    <li> Why can&#x27;t I buy this at the store?  Great product.</li>
    <li> After dying my hair blonde with a lightener, I really needed a toner. I was looking at a bunch of different toning shampoos on Amazon. They were all different prices and I was a bit unsure which one to get, so I got this one based on the reviews and pricing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely was not disappointed at how fast this works. After the first couple of washes, I already noticed a definite decrease in the brassiness.</li>
    <li> I do not use shampoo bit after getting my hair highlighted it was very brassy and orangy. It was suppose to be a very light blond. After using this shampoo 3 days in a row and from there once a week the brassy and orangy tint went away. I am pleased with the results. I use this shampoo once a week or so to keep it nice and blond.</li>
    <li> i have white hair it keeps my hair from turning yellow. it&#x27;s glossy and looks great. cleans without drying out</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 20 years old and my natural hair color is white and always has been! However I&#x27;ve been living in this house with iron in the water for ten years and had so much iron build up in my hair it turned fire engine red!!! Four washes with this stuff and ten years if damage is gone! My hair looks amazing! You can also get it cheaper at rite aid or walgreens.</li>
    <li> This product does nothing to my hair despite the length of time that I leave it on. I have left it on for a very long time and get no change.</li>
    <li> I have silver hair but because I must take certain medication and this causes a yellowing of my hair color. While this shampoo is not a permanent fix for the problem, it does a good job of removing the yellow when I use it.</li>
    <li> Use this all the time for my naturally platinum hair!  Great product!  No residue or blue color on my hair.</li>
    <li> I am trying all the silver shampoos and conditioners.  I can&#x27;t say I love one more than another, and this is a nice one.</li>
    <li> When was the last time you met an aging woman with natural blond hair?  You don&#x27;t, because as we age our hair darkens and can also get yellow or brassy, so women jump on the highlighting train.  I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a couple years now, and I am delighted.  It isn&#x27;t a quick fix, but used consistently it will remove brassiness and bring out your natural highlights.  My hair has turned a lovely platinum with all the various shades of real blond hair, so much nicer than any artificial hair color.  And my hair is healthy, soft and manageable.  I used to switch shampoo a regularly, but this is the only one I will use now.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t take away my bassiness of my bleached hair for a silver color, I used it every other day for 2 weeks and still maybe seen half a shade of lightening when I have seen an extremely platinum/silver tone to other people&#x27;s hair with just using a purple shampoo. Also, IF YOUR TRYING TO STAY AWAY FROM SULPHATES-- they are the first 2 ingredients in the shampoo, which strips your color, SO IF YOUR HAIR IS ALREADY SALON DYED SILVER, THIS IS JUST GOING TO REMOVE EVERYTHING THAT YOU PAID FOR IN NOT 3 WASHES, NOT 2 WASHES, BUT 1!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I finally decided I wanted to let the color grow out in my hair. Had no idea how much Gray I might have but definitely wanted the \\&quot;white or \\&quot;gray\\&quot; hair to have a silver look and not yellow or drab. Had heard that Jhirmack shampoo was great for that but could not locate it anywhere locally. Was so excited to find and at a reasonable pricing . Received it quickly and it definitely lives up to its reputation .Love the shine and sparkle and silvery look it gives to my gray !!! Also great for the few dark hairs still left in my head as well !</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t make my nails blue!! pefect</li>
    <li> This product is great and I love using it. I will continue to purchase it 2 whenever its available.  The service was also good</li>
    <li> Great &amp; Quick shipping!</li>
    <li> Product arrived as promised. This product enhances the white and silver in my hair and removes the yellow residue. Very Satisfied!</li>
    <li> Hair feels soft but does not help with yellowing which is why I purchased it.  Will not order again.</li>
    <li> Leaves your hair soft and smooth.  Great for getting the brassy out!</li>
    <li> This is the second bottle of Jhirmack Silver Plus that I have had.  It does just as well as Pantene and others that I purchased.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and pricing!</li>
    <li> I have used Jharmack shampoo for years and love it but my pharmacy has discontinued selling it glad I found it here</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 27 and I have a few stripes of Grey in my hair thanks to my genetics. I have never dyed my hair but I always get questions about my grey in my dark brown hair. I saw this in a store and for the price, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up. My hair has never been more shiny, manageable, or soft! Love this! My grey are my &amp;#34;highlights&amp;#34; and yes, I love them.</li>
    <li> Extremely drying. Overly perfumed. And left my silvery-white hair with an unattractive cat-poop sandy colour. Horrible stuff.</li>
    <li> Cheap but it doesnt worth it. I prefer the one i was using before Naissant treatment</li>
    <li> i like this product however I do not see it as a regular shampoo  just used periodically works best for me.Since I have platinum bleached hair it tends to pick up on the violet tones.It does do the job of removing any brassy or yellow tones as it says it will on the bottle.I recommend this for anyone who likes to keep their hair bright and of the light blonde color...</li>
    <li> The smell...buy it for the smell!! Maybe it helps my super treated platinum hair but I don&#x27;t really care because it smells sooo good!! And its way cheaper than the purple shampoo you find elsewhere :-D ahhh smells good!</li>
    <li> As advertised  works great makes hair true silver with NO blue or purple!!</li>
    <li> I always used Jhirmack products until I could not find it anywhere.  Have tried many silver hair products. This one is great. I have a mix of blonde, silver and dark blonde hair.  Not colored, just natural. This leaves my hair soft and shiny and feeling great. Does not leave an odor on my hair and it rinses out well.  Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo at walmart because its cheaper there and i would have to say that I absolutely love this product, i have black hair and i went to the salon to get the balayage hair but i wasnt in love with the color result soooo... I  found  this and gave it a try, it says that up to 2 minutes but i did it like for 30 minutes and my hair is lighter it not only works if u are blonde it works if u ended up like with a brown orange hair, so yes i would definitely recommend this if u dont want to bleach ur hair, this is a great option</li>
    <li> It is the best for white or gray hair. I have used it for years.  My hair has never looked yellow.  I think it is the greates and so reasonably priced.  A very good value.</li>
    <li> great product and excellent shipping service</li>
    <li> I use this all the time when my hair is a lighter color so it wont turn into that orange brassy color</li>
    <li> First thing my hair was not doing good since I had highlights but when I saw this I thought I&#x60;ll give it a try and it works wonders will be ordering another bottle  and I love the smell feels clean</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo for those of us with some gray to highlight.</li>
    <li> Bought this to help tone my blonde highlights.  Works wonders. Make sure you have a good conditioner, since it can be pretty drying, but all toners are.  This has worked by far the best of all toners I have tried.</li>
    <li> I will start by saying, I am not a natural blonde (I was as a child but it became darker by my teens). My natural color is a \\&quot;mousy\\&quot; brown. I normally dye my hair darker shades as it is easier to manage than going lighter. Last year I decided to go for blonde and I LOVED it, unfortunately my wallet didn&#x27;t... I was paying $100+ for a whole head of highlights every few months, which even I admit is outrageous but oh did I enjoy being blonde. I really think it&#x27;s true blondes do have more fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t afford it anymore so I just dyed my hair back to brunette. A few months went by and I really missed the blonde! Kind of desperate to get it back I went out and bought a bleaching kit (L&#x27;Oreal Paris Super Blonde Crème Lightening Kit, Medium Brown to Darkest Brown). For an at home bleaching kit it worked great and didn&#x27;t even damage my hair all that much. BUT for me the ultra Barbie blonde just wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for, so I used a blonde hair dye to get it to a more natural shade of blonde (John Frieda Precision Foam Colour, Medium Natural Blonde 8N). This left my hair a gorgeous golden blonde and me a very happy once again blonde!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, this was only until my roots started to show and that&#x27;s when I thought about giving up and going back to my boring brunette hair. But I felt like I had gone through all that effort (and not to mention money!) on becoming blonde again. So I decided to try something, I redyed my hair with another John Frieda Foam Colour, 10B this time (the lightest shade available). I applied it to just the roots then worked it through the rest of my hair for the last ten minutes of the full time and it actually did a great job of even coverage and getting my roots pretty light! They weren&#x27;t exact of course but not so off that it&#x27;d bother me. It looked great for a few weeks but then I noticed my hair starting to get yellow and the dyed roots became brassy, ugh! That&#x27;s when I started to look for a purple shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had heard of purple shampoos before but never had a reason to use one before. So I did some research and I heard about Shimmer Lights and other purple shampoos but most seemed to prefer this Jhirmack. I had never even heard of the brand before and so I was a bit skeptical at first but I figured I had come this far, why not try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I AM SO GLAD I TRIED IT! This is really the solution to my bottle blonde problems. I have only used it twice and already my hair looks so much better. Even after one use I got compliments and was even asked if I had been to the salon! The smell is kind of floral which I don&#x27;t really mind and it is a really neat purple. I only have shoulder length hair but I seemed to need quite a bit to lather it up in my hair. I left it on about 5 minutes and rinsed it out then did the same thing again, no conditioner afterwards. And WOW the results were noticeable as soon as it started drying. No more unsightly yellow and it made my brassy roots so much less noticeable! It made my hair soft and light, and I normally have fine thin hair but it even seemed to give me a bit of volume. Now I will be paying a lot less to keep my hair blonde and that sure does make me happy. I plan to use this as long as it&#x27;s available and I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> It removes the yellow from my grey hair. I cannot use it for every shampoo because it is quite drying.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo to keep grey hair looking good and not getting that dull, brownish look.</li>
    <li> I Have Vern using this product for almost 10 years and I love the shine it gives to my gray hair</li>
    <li> USED IT BEFORE, THEN COULDN&#x27;T FIND IT ANYWHERE. TAKES THE YELLOW OUT OF SILVER HAIR AND MAKES IT NICE AN HEALTHY. GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this shampoo after reading the rave reviews. I have bleached blonde Asian hair. This product didn&#x27;t tone much. I would leave it in my hair for over ten minutes and it barely removes brassiness. Lush Daddy-O Shampoo is far superior but more expensive.</li>
    <li> I am not so young anymore and this product draws the wrinkles in so they seem to just disappear and makeup is so much easier to put on.  I think I look ten years younger and I have gotten compliments on my looks.  Very good buy!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it yet (I will buy this days), but according to the reviews I am very optimistic. I&#x27;m dying my hair blond and always I get yellowish highlights which drives me crazy, and I don&#x27;t want to use bleach. So I hope it will work for me to get a silver shade.&lt;br /&gt;The thing I wanted to tell you all is that the price here is very high, at Walmart is only 3$!</li>
    <li> After a suggestion in a review in amazon I got it but it does not do any different than any ordinary shampoo except the color is deep purple.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo as an alternative to Clairol Shimmers.  I have bleached hair and wanted to get the golden tones out.  It seems to work but unfortunately I found it to be too drying to my scalp and quit using it after only 2 uses.  I followed it up with a deep conditioner but that didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference in the itchiness!  I&#x27;m glad I got it for less than 1/2 this price at WalMart since I&#x27;m now unable to use it.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up going with a product I found from Lee Stafford at ULTA.  :)</li>
    <li> Lathers well. I have dark hair with brassiness that I want to get rid of. I don&#x27;t notice an effect so far. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again and will try something else.</li>
    <li> I lost all of my hair after chemo and when it began to grow back, instead of my usual dirty blonde it came back white.&lt;br /&gt;As it got longer I noticed it took on a yellowish tinge that I didn&#x27;t care for, so I was debating whether or not to just color it a medium blonde shade.&lt;br /&gt;I found this shampoo and decided to heck with it, I&#x27;m going to embrace my new gray hair and become a silver fox.&lt;br /&gt;After just one use it got rid of all the yellow and my hair is a soft and shiny platinum. I like the new me very much.</li>
    <li> GOT BETTER RESULTS WITH OTHER PRODUCTS</li>
    <li> Great Product. An improvement on the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; silver shampoo. But DON&#x27;T buy here. The same product is less than $4.00 in Walmart!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite shampoos ever. It has a good smell and makes my hair feel shiny and healthy. It also gets the daily oil out easily but doesn&#x27;t make it feel too dried out and brittle either. It does make your grey hairs brighter so they look more like blonde highlights. I&#x27;ve been using it for years, but it was getting hard to find locally, so i have been ordering it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a nice shampoo - not too strong a scent - makes my hair look soft - just wish it gave it more shine!</li>
    <li> I was steered to this product as a substitute for Nexxus Simply Silver/Platinum Pro. While it&#x27;s a fine shampoo and seems to be a shampoo conditioner in one, it does not have the brightening and yellow countering capabilities that the Nexxus product has. I&#x27;ll use this until gone, but hen switch back.</li>
    <li> My hair is clean and a little brighter white when i use this product.</li>
    <li> It is not harsh like clairol shimmer lights. It is very moisturizing surprisingly enough, and the shine is brilliant! It says to leave on for up to 2 minutes, I did it for 5 the first time I used it. I got out of the shower and immediately saw this brilliant shine with it wet and thought wow, what&#x27;s it going to look like dry! Amazing softness, shine and brilliance thats what!</li>
    <li> Best shampoo for gray hair.  No purple traces at all.  Smells good and leaves a great shine.  And the price is great.</li>
    <li> Now that my hair is turning gray, I wanted to really hilite!!  I love my hair and the shine this shampoo gives is perfect for my hair!!</li>
    <li> This is the s****iest purple shampoo. Please invest in a better product because it won&#x27;t do anything.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve bleached or lightening your hair, and you are in need of a toning shampoo to help with yellowness or redness, this shampoo will NOT help you! It does not matter how many times you use it, or how long you leave it on. I used it as a normal shampoo and it did absolutely nothing. I then applied it to my dry hair and left it on for &amp;#34;45 minutes&amp;#34; and again it did absolutely nothing! If you need help with brassy hair, do not purchase this shampoo. Save your money and buy a toner.</li>
    <li> so far it seems to be fine. I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference yet but I think after using it for a while longer, I&#x27;ll have a more informed opinion</li>
    <li> I used it today and found that my hair came out soft and shiny.  I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Used this for years- I really like it - great for BLONDE hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had gray hair since my late 30s (I&#x27;m 69 now) and I get frequent compliments on my shiny silver hair as a result of using Jhirmack Silver Plus Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I ran out earlier this year and used ordinary shampoo for several months until I noticed my hair had taken on a disturbing yellowish cast.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s when I ordered a new bottle of Jhirmack Silver Plus Shampoo. After only a couple of uses the yellow was gone.&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff if you have gray hair and don&#x27;t want to hide it.</li>
    <li> Works great, will buy again.  Thick and rich, smells good and leaves hair soft.  No dull residue.</li>
    <li> I went gray in my 20&#x27;s and began colouring because it was cheaper than the shampoos to prevent yellowing. Now in my 50&#x27;s, I decided to &#x27;go natural&#x27; and hope for the best.  My hairdresser recommended Jhirmack Silver Plus Shampoo as a product that worked and was a reasonable price.  He was right.  My hair keeps its beautiful silver colour, is soft and manageable, and the price really is reasonable.  There is no terrible smell to this shampoo, it does not stain my hands, rinses out like any &#x27;normal&#x27; shampoo, and my silver hair stays bright and shiny!</li>
    <li> It works well and doesn&#x27;t stain my hands. What more could you ask for?  I need six more words, period.</li>
    <li> THIS SHAMPOO IS AMAZING! DOESN&#x27;T TURN MY HAIR PURPLE,AND MY HANDS IS NOT PURPLE AS WELL AFTER I USE IT.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;M VERY HAPPY. I USE 2X WEEK,AND MY HAIR IS NICE AND PLATINUM BLONDE !!!  I LOVE IT :)</li>
    <li> I have used this before.  It does just what it says it does...</li>
    <li> i wanna thank this girl on amazon that reviewed a product called shimmering lights. she recommended jhirmack silver plus bc it works just as great smells great n is cheaper!!. if it wasnt for her i wouldve spent extra money for no reason lol. so thank you who ever u are. now let me spread the word. this product works great i love it i have platinum blonde hair definitely faded out those unwanted orange tones. inexpensive n i love the smell. oh and it made my hair feel great as well.</li>
    <li> I had been reading the reviews for Clairol&#x27;s Shimmer Lights and decided to try this instead.  I have had my hair professionally bleached &amp; highlighted for years and it sometimes looks a bit yellow between visits.  This shampoo is not as purple as similar products I&#x27;ve tried so I think it might be best for those who want to correct light to moderate brassiness.  This shampoo is a silicone-free, sulfate shampoo so if you&#x27;re used to using silicone-based or sulfate-free shampoos, it will feel a bit drier than your usual brand.  (However if you follow up with a deep conditioner it should eliminate any possible dryness.)  I normally use sulfate-free, silicone-free hair products but I use this once a week or so to clarify and keep the color nice and I have no complaints.  Great value for the money and it doesn&#x27;t turn your hair blue like some of the other purple shampoos do.</li>
