      <li>I liked the fact it was a pen.</li>
      <li>Well, i honestly don&#x27;t see a difference.</li>

      <li>I love this tooth whitener because if you have crowns, etc.</li>
      <li>would be better</li>
      <li>I think you&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
      <li>But the gel goes between teeth better than the strips.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.    </li>
      <li>Thanks for carrying this great product.</li>
      <li>The reviews were pretty good</li>
      <li>It was easy to use and worked pretty good.  </li>
      <li>Its so, easy to use, compact, so it goes anywhere.  </li>
      <li>An easy to use whitening pen.  </li>
      <li>I followed the manufacturer&#x27;s suggested use guide and saw the stains lightening very quickly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not that easy to come out.</li>
      <li>I first bought a pen two months ago, and after only two days&#x27; application, my teeth looked awesome -- like I&#x27;d just had them cleaned.  </li>
      <li>It was easy to apply, however, the overall whitening wasn&#x27;t very effective.</li>
      <li>it is cheap and make differrence</li>
      <li>and I have to use my finger to smooth it onto my teeth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different whitening devices, including strips and a brush-on gel with a light, and I liked this one best of all.</li>
      <li>If you want to simply whiten up your teeth, this product is great.</li>
      <li>Over all, it&#x27;s easy to use, no harsh taste, cost effective, and works.</li>
      <li>It was easy to apply, but that was about the only thing good that I can say about the product.</li>
      <li>The application is pretty easy, the pen is nice, no bad taste, no wait time really, i did it before bed every night because it says not to eat right after.</li>
      <li>Plus it didn&#x27;t seem to do more than anything much at all.</li>
      <li>The gel seems to dissipate quickly</li>
      <li>I bought this for quick touchups between whitening treatments.</li>
      <li>They work really well and are easy to use.</li>
      <li>Bought this after being recommended on a popular medically oriented TV show.</li>
      <li>I did feel my teeth were more sensitive after using a couple of days in a row</li>
      <li>It is a simple way to clean your teeth better.</li>
      <li>I have found the pen dose great,takes the stain right out.</li>
      <li>Listerine&#x27;s Whitening Pen does exactly what it says.</li>
      <li>I had heard that these Whitening Pens really whitened your teeth</li>
      <li>It is clumpy and I did not get much out of the pen.  </li>
      <li>There is a very minuscule amount of product in this pen.  </li>
      <li>I liked the strips because unlike the other brands, they dissolved completely</li>
      <li>But, this is why it is offered at a reasonable price, and without paying a high dental visit bill.</li>
      <li>It will whiten up your teeth, but not like a high dental-grade gel would.</li>
      <li>and i can honestly say that it is HARD TO USE.</li>
      <li>i don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s from the new toothepaste i have or this though, ha.</li>
      <li>I was excited for this product with it being only 16 total (product and shipping)</li>
      <li>The instructions say you can use the pen 14 days in a row, but I think I stopped after four days because I was pleased with the results (and lazy).    </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the exact same stuff that is on the whitening strips, it&#x27;s just without the strip.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have enough peroxide to make your teeth super white in one go.  </li>
      <li>because I really didn&#x27;t want to spend 30-50 dollars on crest white strips.</li>
      <li>Two months later, I decided to try it again and see what would happen if I really did use the pen for 14 days.  </li>
      <li>so long it started to really get stained when i drank coffie.</li>
      <li>Go to the dentist and have your teeth professionally cleaned prior to application.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use -- twist until gel appears on the small sponge applicator, smear it on your teeth, let it sit for a few minutes.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s extremely convenient and absolutely does what it promises to do.</li>
      <li>I bought this since it was discounted and had high hopes after reading some other reviews.  </li>
      <li>I began seeing a little difference, and I was using it as directed, but then it didn&#x27;t really work anymore, and</li>

<li> We are a family that only drinks water and for my daughter milk, so that can&#x27;t be used as an excuse to why it didn&#x27;t work..</li>
<li> The pen has a pretty wide tip, and I have a hard time painting individual teeth.  </li>
<li> Even at that, the effects are only temporary, lasting less than one week.  </li>
<li> If you are looking for extreme, blinding white teeth, save your cash and head to your dentist.</li>
<li> After only 4 uses there is no more product, and I only used it on my bottom teeth, and only on those at the side, which were slightly discoloured compared to the rest of my teeth.  </li>
<li> , so it&#x27;s really not the sort of thing you&#x27;d want anyone but your nearest and dearest to have to look at.  </li>
<li> It is known these types of products can alter your enamel and affect your gums which is why I say consider carefully and do not over-use.</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t do squat and it was empty before I knew it.</li>
<li> It was like receiving something another person allready used the end of the pen was all dried up the freshness seal was allready opened GROSS how could i put this in my mouth</li>
<li> Occasionally when the stains seem worse i alternate arm and hammer tooth</li>
<li> My teeth are generally very sensitive, but the pen hasn&#x27;t made that worse at all</li>
<li> My teeth are not real straight and the pen is too stiff to get in between the teeth.</li>
<li> It is not worth the money.</li>
<li> Not worth it.</li>
<li> but i dont like the fact that its hard to apply, could be because the tip is hard if it was soft</li>
<li> It&#x27;s also less sensitizing than the sit-two-hour products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I have had this product for about a week and a half</li>
<li> Also, I haven&#x27;t had any odd smells on this, as one reviewer stated.</li>
<li> That sounded a little scary to me as it is not worth damaging my teeth long run, just for short term whiteness.</li>
<li> Off course, the amount of product was too little for any whitening to occur.</li>
<li> But my teeth do look a little whiter</li>
<li> waste of money.  </li>
<li> Waste of time..</li>
<li> this product was hard to apply so i decided to use it to brush my teeth</li>
<li> This is a product you must use every day for at least two weeks at a time.  </li>
<li> Now it&#x27;s not a miracle worker, but for something so simple I was honestly shocked.</li>
<li> It IS a bit of false advertising to say that you can use the pen at the office and on the go.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, the solution didn&#x27;t stay on my teeth</li>
<li> I purchased this because it was recommended on Dr. Oz (don&#x27;t we all buy stuff that&#x27;s recommended on Dr. Oz?), but I find that the gel stuff that comes out the end is difficult to use.</li>
<li> But its not too bad for the $.</li>
<li> I was very disappointed.</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>
<li> It taste nasty.</li>

    <li> An easy to use whitening pen.  I keep one at work, another in my handbag,  and one at home.  Give it a try....I think you&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
    <li> Bought this after being recommended on a popular medically oriented TV show. Could not find it in any store locally. Have used it several times and it does whiten your teeth immediately. As with all whitening products, the whitening factor depends on your starting teeth color. I read the package and then called the company because they suggest discontinuing use after two weeks and then consulting your dentist for further use. That sounded a little scary to me as it is not worth damaging my teeth long run, just for short term whiteness. I did feel my teeth were more sensitive after using a couple of days in a row so I am now just using it occasionally when I want brighter teeth for an event. It is known these types of products can alter your enamel and affect your gums which is why I say consider carefully and do not over-use.</li>
    <li> Waste of time.. I used it, my daughter also tried it, and it didn&#x27;t change the color of our teeth at all.. We are a family that only drinks water and for my daughter milk, so that can&#x27;t be used as an excuse to why it didn&#x27;t work.. Also no smoking.. I recommend saving your money and getting it done at a doctors office.. I&#x27;m an anti-dentite but still say its the only way your going to get a white or even a color change for your teeth..</li>
    <li> Listerine&#x27;s Whitening Pen does exactly what it says. It will whiten up your teeth, but not like a high dental-grade gel would. But, this is why it is offered at a reasonable price, and without paying a high dental visit bill. If you want to simply whiten up your teeth, this product is great. If you are looking for extreme, blinding white teeth, save your cash and head to your dentist. Over all, it&#x27;s easy to use, no harsh taste, cost effective, and works. I like the pen and will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. My teeth are not real straight and the pen is too stiff to get in between the teeth. Plus it didn&#x27;t seem to do more than anything much at all. I suggest getting a stronger peroxide mix and a flexible tray.</li>
    <li> After years of coffee and chewing tobbacy and without a cleaning for 15 years, my toofs aren&#x27;t the whitest of the bunch.  To put it simply, I sh.t myself seeing how well this product works.  Now it&#x27;s not a miracle worker, but for something so simple I was honestly shocked. You should see results in about 2 weeks.  The pen lasts about a month if used 2x a day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different whitening devices, including strips and a brush-on gel with a light, and I liked this one best of all. It&#x27;s very easy to use -- twist until gel appears on the small sponge applicator, smear it on your teeth, let it sit for a few minutes. I do see a difference in the whiteness of my teeth, and it is easier to get the gel in the spots you want with this applicator. Also, I haven&#x27;t had any odd smells on this, as one reviewer stated.</li>
    <li> I bought this since it was discounted and had high hopes after reading some other reviews.  It was easy to apply, however, the overall whitening wasn&#x27;t very effective.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do squat and it was empty before I knew it. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought this pen about 9 months ago i use it about every day and still have some left.The instructions say it isn&#x27;t good on dental material ,which is why i bought it.I have a chip on my front tooth that was covered 10 years ago,after being there so long it started to really get stained when i drank coffie.I have found the pen dose great,takes the stain right out.Occasionally when the stains seem worse i alternate arm and hammer tooth whitener.which I also bought at the same time and still have some left.  Both these products cause the stains to be gone,and do some what increase whitening.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about two weeks and probably used it around ten times.  I can tell quite a difference too.  It&#x27;s the exact same stuff that is on the whitening strips, it&#x27;s just without the strip.</li>
    <li> waste of money.  Buy the Listerine dissolving strips instead.  They work really well and are easy to use.</li>
    <li> I love this tooth whitener because if you have crowns, etc. that you can not use whitener one, this is the one for you as you can target only the teeth that need whitening or that you can use the whitener on.  I had looked all around and couldn&#x27;t find this product after initially buying it in a store and found it on Amazon.  Thanks for carrying this great product.</li>
    <li> preferred to use with 3d crest whitestrip for good results. I like this whitening pen. it is cheap and make differrence</li>
    <li> I have had this product for about a week and a half and i can honestly say that it is HARD TO USE. You definately have to have a mirror to put it on and you dont want it to touch your gums or it will burn (experiance) It&#x27;s not that easy to come out. But my teeth do look a little whiter i don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s from the new toothepaste i have or this though, ha. But its not too bad for the $.</li>
    <li> I bought Listerine Whitening Strips for years, and had them on Subscribe and Save here.  But it was cancelled, so I moved over to the pen.  I liked the strips because unlike the other brands, they dissolved completely and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about finding a place to discard the strip when time was up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strips were easier to apply.  The pen has a pretty wide tip, and I have a hard time painting individual teeth.  But the gel goes between teeth better than the strips.  This is a product you must use every day for at least two weeks at a time.  It doesn&#x27;t have enough peroxide to make your teeth super white in one go.  It&#x27;s also less sensitizing than the sit-two-hour products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this if your teeth are healthy, and you&#x27;re trying to maintain a bright smile.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see a lot of improvement but some in my two front teeth. I think I may have to see the dentist about them!</li>
    <li> I purchased this because it was recommended on Dr. Oz (don&#x27;t we all buy stuff that&#x27;s recommended on Dr. Oz?), but I find that the gel stuff that comes out the end is difficult to use. It does not stick to my teeth and I have to use my finger to smooth it onto my teeth. I don&#x27;t think it is doing any whitening, and it is making my gums hurt, which is one of the potential side effects listed in the package insert.</li>
    <li> I was excited for this product with it being only 16 total (product and shipping) because I really didn&#x27;t want to spend 30-50 dollars on crest white strips. The reviews were pretty good so i figured i&#x27;d give it a try. Well, i honestly don&#x27;t see a difference. The application is pretty easy, the pen is nice, no bad taste, no wait time really, i did it before bed every night because it says not to eat right after. But the product itself didn&#x27;t do anything for me. So needless to say, I cannot give more than a 2 on this product.</li>
    <li> It was like receiving something another person allready used the end of the pen was all dried up the freshness seal was allready opened GROSS how could i put this in my mouth im sure some1 had allready used it</li>
    <li> This pen does not work all that great. It taste nasty. It is not worth the money. You will get better results using teeth whitener mouthwash and 3-D toothpaste.</li>
    <li> As a smoker and coffee drinker, I know what it&#x27;s like to wish my teeth were pearly white.  Well, they may never be THAT white again, but this product definitely exceeds expectations.  I first bought a pen two months ago, and after only two days&#x27; application, my teeth looked awesome -- like I&#x27;d just had them cleaned.  The instructions say you can use the pen 14 days in a row, but I think I stopped after four days because I was pleased with the results (and lazy).    Two months later, I decided to try it again and see what would happen if I really did use the pen for 14 days.  I&#x27;m three days in and my teeth are already sparkly.  My teeth are generally very sensitive, but the pen hasn&#x27;t made that worse at all -- there&#x27;s no discomfort and no increased sensitivity.  I love this product.    It IS a bit of false advertising to say that you can use the pen at the office and on the go.  The gel looks kinda smeary and, well, gel-like on your teeth, so it&#x27;s really not the sort of thing you&#x27;d want anyone but your nearest and dearest to have to look at.  But it&#x27;s extremely convenient and absolutely does what it promises to do.</li>
    <li> this product was hard to apply so i decided to use it to brush my teeth it removes the stain on my teeth when i use it to brush but i dont like the fact that its hard to apply, could be because the tip is hard if it was soft would be better</li>
    <li> It was okay I will probably don&#x27;t buy it again.i thought it was going to work better.thank you anyway hilda</li>
    <li> Its so, easy to use, compact, so it goes anywhere.  I think though that they may have stopped making it.</li>
    <li> I used it as directed, and noticed no difference at all.  There was no burning sensation, or anything like that on my gums, so it is safe.  It just didn&#x27;t work on me.</li>
    <li> The Listerine whitening pen for teeth works. It is a simple way to clean your teeth better. I like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved Listerine whitening strips and it appears as though they have been discontinued.  Purchased this pen instead and do not like it at all.  The gel seems to dissipate quickly so I don&#x27;t know how effective this can be.  It is clumpy and I did not get much out of the pen.  I purchased six, for my daughters and myself and none of us will be using this product again.</li>
    <li> This works if you continue to use it on a regular basis</li>
    <li> This product gives immediate, short-term, temporary effect.  Go to the dentist and have your teeth professionally cleaned prior to application.  Even at that, the effects are only temporary, lasting less than one week.  So save your money.</li>
    <li> I had heard that these Whitening Pens really whitened your teeth so my son ordered me one, and when I started using it I began seeing a little difference, and I was using it as directed, but then it didn&#x27;t really work anymore, and I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this for quick touchups between whitening treatments. I liked the fact it was a pen. Unfortunately, the solution didn&#x27;t stay on my teeth and I saw no difference in color after several applications. It was easy to apply, but that was about the only thing good that I can say about the product.</li>
    <li> I followed the manufacturer&#x27;s suggested use guide and saw the stains lightening very quickly. I have no complaints with this product.</li>
    <li> Please do not buy this product.  There is a very minuscule amount of product in this pen.  After only 4 uses there is no more product, and I only used it on my bottom teeth, and only on those at the side, which were slightly discoloured compared to the rest of my teeth.  Off course, the amount of product was too little for any whitening to occur.</li>
    <li> It was easy to use and worked pretty good.  I like the Listerine products and will continue to buy them.</li>
