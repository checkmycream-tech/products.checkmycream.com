      <li>It&#x27;s easy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on Amazon to do a six-monthly subscription to the 4 pack - that will work just fine for me.</li>
      <li>no  longer easily available at drugstores nor Walmart.  </li>
      <li>The Xtreme3 razor provides a smooth shave for both legs and underarms.</li>
      <li>And to top it off, it still works better than a brand new Gillette.</li>
      <li>Excellent price on a great product that is almost impossible to find in stores.</li>
      <li>The Gillette flexible blade were the ones that were depicted shaving a bowling ball in their original TV spots to promote their ability to contour to your face.  </li>
      <li>None are as clean shaving as the Xtreme.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quick.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>I recalled linking them and found my old razor and enjoyed finding them on Amazon and getting them promptly.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used all types of Gillett, the new Bic cartridge(terrible) and most of the new Shicks</li>
      <li>I love mu Schick Xtreme3 razor, but have not been able to find blades for it in the past of couple of years.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just grateful to find someplace that sells these razor blades and sells them at a reasonable price!  </li>
      <li>After several days of use they are more skin scrappers than razors.</li>
      <li>Over the years I&#x27;ve used many different razors and blades, usually whatever was convenient and of reasonably good quality at the grocery store or pharmacy.  </li>
      <li>This shaves smoothly every time - no razor burn and no rough spots.</li>
      <li>really* experience the blade quality directly, and these Xtreme blades are providing a clean, close shave with no nicks or cuts, just like they used to.  </li>
      <li>Bought the three pack to give me a large supply.  </li>
      <li>I was happy to find these cartridges, as they were not available in the local stores that I checked.  </li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t say much about this product as I bought it for my son as he couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, only disposable razors are available in this format in stores I have shopped.</li>
      <li>Found them online, ordered and they arrived in a reasonable time.</li>
      <li>In fact, they work very well.  </li>
      <li>BIC throwaway razors keep an edge much longer as do the twin blade cartridge type.</li>
      <li>such a clean shave</li>
      <li>had previously used and loved the Xtreme razor and blades, but they hadn&#x27;t been carried locally in years and years.  </li>
      <li>These blades fit the razor and have nearly the same packaging.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>so had to buy a new one for my trip.</li>
      <li>but, these particular blades seemed old.</li>
      <li>Nicked more with these than previous blades of the same model.</li>
      <li>It remains to be seen if these replacement cartridges are the remaining few available anywhere....  </li>
      <li>For me the slight difference in price is worth the quality.</li>
      <li>I am very fussy about my shave and have tried  several later models by Shick and Gilette.</li>
      <li>Gillette user, for no other reason that they&#x27;re everywhere</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product,  The blades last a very long time.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have always bought these from retail store. Unfortunately it&#x27;s getting harder to find them. I have personal ties to this razor since it was my Dad&#x27;s. Anyway found the blades here no problem and they were cheaper too!</li>
    <li> I have tried all kinds of razors and Schick is the only razor for me with XTREME3 blades. They are by far the best in my experience.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have searched everywhere for these razor blades and finally found them here. These are his absolute favorite!!</li>
    <li> The Xtreme3 razor provides a smooth shave for both legs and underarms. I have been using it for years and have been completely satisfied. I recently moved to another state and couldn&#x27;t find the cartridges in stores. Now I have them delivered by Amazon and save money using subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> The Gillette flexible blade were the ones that were depicted shaving a bowling ball in their original TV spots to promote their ability to contour to your face.  In fact, they work very well.  I have a curly beard and a close even shave is paramount to me to avoid ingrown hairs.  These blades do the trick every time.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Best blades around...I still am amazed at how many shaves I can get from one blade</li>
    <li> Love the razor and the shave. Blades (cartridges) no  longer easily available at drugstores nor Walmart.  Bought the three pack to give me a large supply.  I am very fussy about my shave and have tried  several later models by Shick and Gilette. None are as clean shaving as the Xtreme. Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> A little smoother than sensors and may last longer.  I recalled linking them and found my old razor and enjoyed finding them on Amazon and getting them promptly.  Everything&#x27;s been great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time Gillette user, for no other reason that they&#x27;re everywhere so it&#x27;s easy to buy them. I travel a lot and one time I left my razor at a hotel so had to buy a new one for my trip. I got whatever they had, and luckily for me it was the Xtreme 3 - by far the best blade I have ever used. This shaves smoothly every time - no razor burn and no rough spots. This blade has seriously lasted me three months! And to top it off, it still works better than a brand new Gillette. Maybe it&#x27;s the flexible blade (which I didn&#x27;t realize it had until I was here looking for a replacement blade). I&#x27;m never using any other blade. I&#x27;m on Amazon to do a six-monthly subscription to the 4 pack - that will work just fine for me.</li>
    <li> Good value but, these particular blades seemed old. As in the the gel strips did not do as well as previous blades of the same model. Nicked more with these than previous blades of the same model.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Has become impossible to get locally! Wish they&#x27;d get rid of some cleaning products that are absolutely worthless and stop trying to improve on and eleiminate something that does the job just great.</li>
    <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve used many different razors and blades, usually whatever was convenient and of reasonably good quality at the grocery store or pharmacy.  However, over the years the price of razors and blades has continued to notch up, and I was at the point where I was using the [[ASIN:B000BUUVTE Gillette Fusion razor]] and blades.  I had no complaints about the Fusion, other than price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the local prices for Fusion blades had gotten really outrageous, and I came to Amazon looking to get my Fusion blades more cheaply.  They are cheaper here (around 25% less than local prices), but in my searching I noticed that I could also buy Schick Xtreme razors and blades, for approximately half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had previously used and loved the Xtreme razor and blades, but they hadn&#x27;t been carried locally in years and years.  So I figured, as long as I&#x27;m looking to buy blades online anyway, why not get the Xtremes for significantly less money?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using them now for a couple of weeks, and they are as good as I remembered.  Note that I dry shave, so I *really* experience the blade quality directly, and these Xtreme blades are providing a clean, close shave with no nicks or cuts, just like they used to.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like to shave,&lt;br /&gt;but this Schick made my shaving less painful, and less uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Still use Extra Virgin Olive oil to prepare my skin&lt;br /&gt;instead of those chemicals advertised on TV.</li>
    <li> Great and cheaper than IF I were to find it at a retail store!</li>
    <li> Extreme 3 blades are excellent and flex to the contours of the face. Unfortunately, only disposable razors are available in this format in stores I have shopped. Happily, Amazon.com was able to &amp;#34;come to the rescue&amp;#34;! It remains to be seen if these replacement cartridges are the remaining few available anywhere....  I don&#x27;t know that Schick is still manufacturing Extreme 3 Replacement Cartridges.</li>
    <li> These blades fit the razor and have nearly the same packaging.  I noticed that the plastic safety cover on each individual blade was different than on SubZero Xtreme 3 blades I have purchased in the past.  The next difference was razor burn on my legs.</li>
    <li> These razor replacements were hard to find and were quite expensive.  I found them here in a pack of three at a great price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the razor for years and have found it difficult to buy the replacement cartridges in stores.  This online deal was the answer to resolve my problem.  Cheaper than the store, easy to order.  Hope the supply holds up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Schick Xtreme3 fan for many years. However, finding the cartridges in brick and mortar stores is just about impossible. Several years ago I started ordering replacement cartridges through Amazon. It&#x27;s quick. It&#x27;s easy. I get the replacement cartridges for a good price, and, as a bonus, save a lot of my time and gas.</li>
    <li> Great Quality!  I highly recommend this product,  The blades last a very long time. Its great for Men and women.</li>
    <li> They are what they are supposed to be and arrived almost at the time I expected</li>
    <li> Over the 40 some years I&#x27;ve been shaving the Shick Xtreme 3 has been the best I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve used all types of Gillett, the new Bic cartridge(terrible) and most of the new Shicks but nothing compares to the close and subsequent long lasting shave I get with the Shick Xtreme 3 blades and razor.</li>
    <li> When I started to realize that every few years, razor blade companies were going to keep adding another blade or gimmick to up the price of a razor, I stopped here.  The Xtreme 3 is all the razor you need.  You are just getting fleeced if you really believe these other silly multiple-blade razors with cool strips, vibrating handles, etc. are any better.  I&#x27;m actually shocked that Schick hasn&#x27;t discontinued this model to force to pay more for whatever product is the next step up from here.  They are getting harder to find in stores, unfortunately.  So I just buy them here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just grateful to find someplace that sells these razor blades and sells them at a reasonable price!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Thank you for selling these. I love my razor and didn&#x27;t want to change, now I don&#x27;t have to. Four, five, and six blades are too many!</li>
    <li> could not find the cartridges at retail and was informed by Schick they no longer made the product. Found them online, ordered and they arrived in a reasonable time. Have not used any yet, but assume they are the same as I have been using for years. If they are I will be satisfied.</li>
    <li> Great Product but very pricey. good product but very pricey. great product. too many words required. hello. Schick needs to provide at better price</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find these blade cartridges in stores any more so I was pleased to find them on Amazon and ordered a years supply.  Three blades provide a very good shave and the cool strip leaves your face feeling great.</li>
    <li> I have used these Extreme Razors for years and was lost when I could not get them in a Brick and Mortar store anymore. So I went to Extremes(pun) and bought a good supply of them online. Something about this product that works. Don&#x27;t know why you can only get them online.</li>
    <li> Excellent price on a great product that is almost impossible to find in stores. Great shaves at an excellent price</li>
    <li> I find it getting harder and harder to find Schick blades. It&#x27;s like Gillette has an almost monopoly on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the Extreme razor and refuse to give it up as long as the blades are made. The price seemed good, so Amazon go the order, and I didn&#x27;t have to run around Las Vegas trying to find them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> Easy way to get replacement blades at a good value. I have been getting replacements for years and had no problems.</li>
    <li> These are the worst razor blades I have ever used. BIC throwaway razors keep an edge much longer as do the twin blade cartridge type. After several days of use they are more skin scrappers than razors.</li>
    <li> These are great. Hard to find the Extreme 3 Blades. I think they are the best. like the three blades better then the 5 blade fusion.</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t say much about this product as I bought it for my son as he couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores. He prefers these to any others that are out there. I&#x27;ll have to assume it does the job otherwise he wouldn&#x27;t have me buy it.</li>
    <li> I get many great shaves from these cartridges!</li>
    <li> I was happy to find these cartridges, as they were not available in the local stores that I checked.  I like they way they cut -- such a clean shave that I can sometimes skip a day of shaving!</li>
    <li> I love mu Schick Xtreme3 razor, but have not been able to find blades for it in the past of couple of years. This was wonderful. These blades give you a very smooth shave with the bulk of the never 4 and 5 blade systems.</li>
    <li> Flexes in the middle so that it fits the contour of one&#x27;s head. Three blades is plenty for this use...</li>
    <li> Great! Cannot find these refills in any local store. They also cost less than the last package we purchased.</li>
    <li> A  great deal. Thet cost little and cut forever.</li>
    <li> Started using these schick blades around June 2012. These are slightly better in quality than Mach 3 that I have been using for 5+ years. I find fewer nicks than with Mach 3. These are significantly better in price than Mach3.&lt;br /&gt;This is not the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; shaving blade either. I would give this 4 stars and Mach3 will get 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that you can find Schick Xtreme3 blades that are not \\&quot;SubZero\\&quot;. The non-subzero blades are slightly cheaper that \\&quot;SubZero\\&quot; blades and I found them to be somewhat inferior to the \\&quot;SubZero\\&quot; blades. For me the slight difference in price is worth the quality. It is easy to buy non-SubZero blades (like I did), so be sure to check the description.</li>
    <li> I have not checked the blades for sharpness but they did arrive on time.And were in a nice box withgood packaging.</li>
