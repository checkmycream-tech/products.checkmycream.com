<li> or you will over dry the skin causing irritation.</li>
<li> and now I have unfixably flaky skin for the next few days</li>
<li> The lotion-- a little goes A LONG WAY.</li>
<li> Also a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> Alittle goes a long way so just don&#x27;t be heavy handed</li>
<li> Just use a little of the lotion, so you won&#x27;t have a wet face.  </li>
<li> However, after using it for  4 days ....i think the chemical in the product had a reaction to the sun that cause me to get rashes...where my skin started to peal little by little.</li>
<li> ans controls pimple and everyday breakouts.</li>
<li> It also dried my skin out</li>
<li> just not a good product.</li>
<li> I have combination skin that is never happy.</li>
<li> All it did was make my acne worse.</li>
<li> My 14 -year-old son is dealing with really bad acne, face and shoulders.</li>
<li> I had really bad chin acne</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This seems to be a good skin care set for acne not a miracle worker. I bought it for my daughter age 12 she forgets to use it sometimes but we have had any troubles.Alittle goes a long way so just don&#x27;t be heavy handed or you will over dry the skin causing irritation.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me. All it did was make my acne worse. and yes, I waited it out so that the \\&quot;purging\\&quot; stage would stop. just not a good product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t make anything go away, but it took away the redness. My complexion is somehow great now. BUT All the bumps are still there, you just have to look harder to see them since they blend right in. Not quite what I was looking for. It also dried my skin out and now I have unfixably flaky skin for the next few days (no amount of ANYTHING will fix this). I used it morning and night, only took 4-5 days for my skin to go kaput.</li>
    <li> Whenever I&#x27;m breaking out- it&#x27;s because i&#x27;m not using this.  This Clear Proof Acne system always gets the job done.  The wash it so soft..  P.S. - The lotion-- a little goes A LONG WAY. Just use a little of the lotion, so you won&#x27;t have a wet face.  But- this is def 5 stars</li>
    <li> I got the travel pack to try it out before committing, and within a week could tell a difference in my skin. I ended up buying the regular size and use this trial size for when I take weekend trips. I have tried so many products, and some made my skin worse. This is definitely a product worth trying!</li>
    <li> My 14 -year-old son is dealing with really bad acne, face and shoulders. Having good results with Mary Kay in the past, and after going through to other friends and not getting my clearing...the MK clear proof system have him BETTER SKIN IN ONE WASH! No kidding, he came to me and I could tell just by the fresh look to his face that he used it. Within another week, 50% clearing and now 2 1/2 weeks, he is almost completely cleared!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a month now. One of my aunts recommended it to me and i am glad i tried it out!! I had really bad chin acne and it is almost all gone. I am really impressed with the results!!!</li>
    <li> it got rid of my ance love it.</li>
    <li> At first I was I upset that Mary kay took away my velocity brand. So I had no choice but to try the clear proof. But it has my skin clearer and glowing. I love this product.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast and the product was protected so there wouldn&#x27;t be a mess! Perfect size for travel.</li>
    <li> The moment i started using this kit saw instant result. My face started looking radiant. However, after using it for  4 days ....i think the chemical in the product had a reaction to the sun that cause me to get rashes...where my skin started to peal little by little. Haven&#x27;t used it since. You think i have a allergic reaction to the product ?</li>
    <li> Works great for my young teen daughter. You can tell if she forgets to use it.</li>
    <li> Cleanser seemed to cause me to breakout even more.  Switched back to ivory soap to cleanse, and then used the oil free moisturizer and on the spot acne treatment afterwards.  I will likely buy the oil free moisturizer separately and stick with ivory soap.  For some reason this cleanser makes me break out deep into the skin.</li>
    <li> Works really well on my 14 year old daughters teen skin!  Much better than Clinique.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I noticed improvement in the first use. My skin was almost completely clear within the first week. I struggle with skin products because I have Lupus and hands down this worked great! Also a little goes a long way. The travel size kit lasted me for a long time.</li>
    <li> It was a good product and didn&#x27;t make things worse but it didn&#x27;t seem to help at all. What ever my skin is going through this wasn&#x27;t for me. But i still love Mary Kay products!</li>
    <li> This system has worked better that any product I have tried. I have a purchased many systems from proactive, clearasil to neutrogena. I was also currently using the velocity cleaner by MK but this is better than that. I am using this for my 15 yr old son. I could tell a difference after first wash! It works great for blackheads which are non existent after 2 plus years ans controls pimple and everyday breakouts. Great product !</li>
    <li> I am still having breakouts but I still have hope</li>
    <li> It came really fast and I was so excited to try it but my face got bumpy and itchy after 3 days of using it.</li>
    <li> A Great product worked very well</li>
    <li> I have combination skin that is never happy. If I only focus on products for my acne, my face gets dry and flaky. If I only focus on moisture, I break out in my t-zone. When Clear Proof came out, I tried the trial size and loved it for my acne. I&#x27;ve used the acne gel for almost 20 years, so it is nice that it is in this set. I use Clear Proof in the mornings to combat oiliness during the day, then Timewise at night to address the moisture problems. The light formula is wonderful. So far, the combination has been great. I love that it comes in a trial/travel size.</li>
