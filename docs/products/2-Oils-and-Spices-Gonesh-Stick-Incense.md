      <li>AND I LOVE GONESH</li>
      <li>My all-time favorite incense.</li>
      <li>Really makes the house smell great.  </li>
      <li>I love incense.</li>
      <li>of my favorite scents from Gonesh.  </li>
      <li>There is nothing I can describe it to, since it is its own unique smell.</li>
      <li>I love these the scent is amazing, it smells sweet ,yet spicy, not a ton of smoke...</li>
      <li>Always super fast, super great service and LOVE the fragrance!</li>
      <li>It is way too strong.</li>
      <li>I have a good collection of high quality resin sticks and cones that I rotate, depending on what&#x27;s going on.</li>
      <li>These people are fantastic communicators!&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
      <li>#2 sensual &amp; light</li>
      <li>Burns clean and is strong and as indicated.</li>
      <li>This is the best smelling incense the only thing is the smell fades really fast.</li>
      <li>This product is not new to me, but has fortunately kept its superior quality among most incense ever purchased.  </li>
      <li>I love this scent so much.</li>
      <li>Lasts a long time and has a wonderfully pleasant aroma.  </li>
      <li>But none is as consistently captivating, seductive, mysterious, and satisfying as Gonesh #</li>
      <li>Buy this incense, burn it wherever you live, and let its magic take you somewhere</li>
      <li>in the early 80’s, when my college buddies and I were in a band, most of my disposable income went into cool clothes.</li>
      <li>I took a gamble on this item and got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
      <li>It lights easily, burns completely everytime.</li>
      <li>I actually really like this fragrance!</li>
      <li>and it makes the place smell good, instead of its usual pet smell.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t even make it through one whole stick.</li>
      <li>Well packed , none broke and fast delivery...</li>
      <li>The first third of the first stick gave me a headache.</li>
      <li>I’ll never forget my first visit to Pastense vintage clothes: the store was in an attic in the oldest building in town, filled to the rafters with dead men’s clothes.</li>
      <li>My parents burned this stuff when I was a child, and my whole life (32 now), I&#x27;ve never found a more pleasing, complex incense.</li>
      <li>apartments, frat rooms, and houses later, this incense has remained consistent in quality and formulation.</li>
      <li>Smells like old people.</li>
      <li>In the &#x27;70s as a young person I used to burn incense all the time.  </li>
      <li>If you like the old &amp;#34;headshop&amp;#34; smell, this is it.  </li>
      <li>when i got near my mailbox i could smell the incense.</li>
      <li>So I was pumped when he found an old package.</li>
      <li>I purchased this directly from Gonesh</li>
      <li>The number of different types of incense I’ve tried over the years must be in the high dozens.</li>
      <li>Its slightly musky, but kinda light all at the same time.</li>
      <li>Yep, I&#x27;ve been burning the Gonesh #2 since I was old enough to use a lighter.</li>
      <li>I will add that we have a stinky male dog and a stinky old cat</li>
      <li>I get choked up, these have smoke but it is a pure smoke to me..{ some burn white smoke , others black  }</li>
      <li>It takes a lot to motivate me to leave one - good or bad.</li>

<li> It smells like flowers and I get a small hint of nature</li>
<li> Was feeling nostalgic and ordered some.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> One of my favorite smells by Gonesh.  Really makes the house smell great.  They make the best incense ever!!!!!!! Been using it since the 60&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite incense. My parents burned this stuff when I was a child, and my whole life (32 now), I&#x27;ve never found a more pleasing, complex incense. There is nothing I can describe it to, since it is its own unique smell. Its slightly musky, but kinda light all at the same time. The quality of the incense itself is the best you can get. It lights easily, burns completely everytime. If you like nag champa, dragon&#x27;s blood, sandlewood, mulberry, etc, then you will probably love this too, as it blows them away.</li>
    <li> Yep, I&#x27;ve been burning the Gonesh #2 since I was old enough to use a lighter. I&#x27;ve tried other incense, and burn them on occassion. But Gonesh #2 is my go-to for a wonderful aroma in my home.</li>
    <li> My all-time favorite incense. Good service, as always.</li>
    <li> Always super fast, super great service and LOVE the fragrance! Takes me back to the 70&#x27;s every time I burn it. And the scent lingers for hours! Ahhhhh! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Gonesh incense since the 1980&#x27;s.  Very good quality.  Very good fragrance.  Incense from brick and mortar stores only smell like burning wood.  Gonesh sticks burn a little slower than cheaper ones.  Good company to do business with.</li>
    <li> This is the best fragerance of all of them, thank you.</li>
    <li> If you like the old &amp;#34;headshop&amp;#34; smell, this is it.  Lasts a long time and has a wonderfully pleasant aroma.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> These sticks give a wonderful lightly floral warm scent to my home. Love them.</li>

    <li> A LITTLE HEAVY ON OIL SCENT SO USE WITH VENTILATION OTHERWISE IT IS GREAT, ALWAYS A GREAT PRODUCT AND I LOVE GONESH</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry, I have to post a review here. It takes a lot to motivate me to leave one - good or bad. I have to warn people, though. I love incense. I have a good collection of high quality resin sticks and cones that I rotate, depending on what&#x27;s going on. This incense smells absolutely awful, and really just smells too much period. It is way too strong. The first third of the first stick gave me a headache. By the 50% burned mark I was sick to my stomach. I had to put it out and throw it away by the last quarter. I couldn&#x27;t even make it through one whole stick. I won&#x27;t burn the others, and would encourage others to be careful as well, (if not just avoid this one).</li>
    <li> These people are fantastic communicators!&lt;br /&gt;One of my favorite scents from Gonesh.  Will order more for sure!</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling incense the only thing is the smell fades really fast.</li>
    <li> This product is not new to me, but has fortunately kept its superior quality among most incense ever purchased.  It&#x27;s a brand I will always trust and purchase.</li>
    <li> Love Gonesh! #2 sensual &amp; light</li>
    <li> The number of different types of incense I’ve tried over the years must be in the high dozens. I’ve tried each of the “number” series of Gonesh as well as champa, Dragon’s Blood, natural woods, frankincense, Laxmi Dhoop, even custom-crafted, hand-dipped incense from a little shop in Chicago. I’ve burned incense in cones, strings, resin, sticks, dhoop, bricks, smudge, and the powdery stuff you sprinkle on smoldering charcoal. Of course, each has its charms. But none is as consistently captivating, seductive, mysterious, and satisfying as Gonesh #2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back in the early 80’s, when my college buddies and I were in a band, most of my disposable income went into cool clothes. For a poor college student, that meant frequent trips to the thrift shop. I’ll never forget my first visit to Pastense vintage clothes: the store was in an attic in the oldest building in town, filled to the rafters with dead men’s clothes. Ancient shirts, ties, suits, sweaters, neckties, and shoes shaped like other people’s feet. Musty and dusty like my Grandma’s closet, but sweet, oily and spicy. Of course, the store staff were burning Gonesh #2. I was hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many apartments, frat rooms, and houses later, this incense has remained consistent in quality and formulation. Every stick transports me to somewhere I’ve never been, like an imaginary companion you see every day. Buy this incense, burn it wherever you live, and let its magic take you somewhere you’ve never been before.</li>
    <li> Great product and I would purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I took a gamble on this item and got my money&#x27;s worth. when i got near my mailbox i could smell the incense. this one is by far the best one i have ordered. i tried number 6 and vanilla but there nothing compared to oils and spices. i will definitely order this one again</li>
    <li> I have not had any Gonesh incense for many years.  Was feeling nostalgic and ordered some.  Just as I remember!  Burns clean and is strong and as indicated.</li>
    <li> This is the incense my stepdad used to burn when I was a kid. I have been looking for it for years but no shops ever carried it and he couldn&#x27;t remember the name. So I was pumped when he found an old package. It was empty but I used it to find out what the incense was called. Its awesome. I love this scent so much.</li>
    <li> In the &#x27;70s as a young person I used to burn incense all the time.  Then I \\&quot;grew up\\&quot; and quit burning it. But we just bought a house and it smelled so good and we realized it was from having had incense burning in it. So we decided to get some. We tried several different ones and I did like them all (#6, nag champa, sandlewood, dragon&#x27;s blood) but this is still my favorite, from then until now. I will add that we have a stinky male dog and a stinky old cat and it makes the place smell good, instead of its usual pet smell.</li>
    <li> Smells like old people. Only burnt it for a few minutes before all occupants in the room were complaining of the smell.</li>
    <li> I actually really like this fragrance! It smells like flowers and I get a small hint of nature and it&#x27;s kind of soothing. I purchased this directly from Gonesh and I will be adding this back to me re-up list!</li>
    <li> I love Gonesh! Perfect to make a room or house or wherever feel comfortable, sexy, and safe.</li>
    <li> LOVE THE SMELL OF THIS INCENSE, GREAT COST AND FAST SHIPPING!!!</li>
    <li> They are all really strong but they smell very good. And another plus is  they help me with my headaches and migraines.</li>
    <li> I love these the scent is amazing, it smells sweet ,yet spicy, not a ton of smoke...If I burn some it gets so smoky I get choked up, these have smoke but it is a pure smoke to me..{ some burn white smoke , others black  } I will continue to collect these scents..I love them all ..Well packed , none broke and fast delivery...~!~</li>
