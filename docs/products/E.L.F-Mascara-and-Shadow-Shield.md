### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This works perfectly.</li>
      <li>Awesome product great price can&#x27;t wait to use.</li>
      <li>Nothing to rave about but good for the price!</li>
      <li>When I saw this I thought what a great idea.</li>
      <li>Works great when applying eye shadow or mascara.</li>
      <li>This works great.</li>
      <li>This may be a great product</li>
      <li>great idea</li>
      <li>great idea though</li>
      <li>Its easy to use and keeps any your make up on perfect.</li>
      <li>I thought this was a good idea when I saw it on a you tube channel, so I purchased it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very glad I bought this</li>
      <li>Maybe with some modifications this would be a great product like a wider, more sturdy, shorter handle and thinner shield.</li>
      <li>Outside of that it&#x27;s an awesome tool, great to use when adding volume &amp; combing clumps out of your lashes.</li>
      <li>The product itself seems to be of good quality, so you&#x27;ll enjoy it if you choose to purchase it, but I do not think it&#x27;s a must.</li>
      <li>Great for first time make up users.</li>
      <li>BUT I HAVE FOUND BETTER WAYS</li>
      <li>I love Elf cosmetic brushes.</li>
      <li>but I think it would work better than this.</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>I love this you don&#x27;t have to use a tissue or a q-tip to wipe off mascara or eye shadow.</li>
      <li>I end up with more mascara on the shield than on my lashes.</li>
      <li>Love the silicone shield, product wipes off easily.</li>
      <li>However, you can also choose to apply your foundation after doing your eye makeup and once you&#x27;re done with your makeup, just run a pad with makeup remover over your undereye area and you&#x27;re fine.</li>
      <li>Makes applying mascara, shadow, or eyeliner on bottom lashes with a clean result.</li>
      <li>So if you have more rounded eyes, it would probably work for you, but with my almond eyes it doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s wabbly plastic and smells really strong like plastic for the first couple weeks.</li>
      <li>I love this and will order more in the future.</li>
      <li>wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this new tool...</li>
      <li>Such a handy tool.</li>
      <li>I purchased these from the e.l.f website directly and I love them.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit of a gimmick, but it is useful to catch any fallout and to prevent those unattractive racoon eyes.</li>
      <li>You have to hold it just right, while you apply mascara or eye shadow.</li>
      <li>It sets right below my lower lashes.</li>
      <li>This shadow shield is great for catching the dark shadows that end up under your eyes when doing a smokey eye &amp; for preventing mascara from getting on your eyelid &amp; I like how it is washable &amp; reusable unlike the other products that you stick on under your eyes.  </li>
      <li>The handle is light and kind of like a small brush handle.</li>
      <li>Broke first time I touched it;(</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t find this useful.</li>
      <li>This wasn&#x27;t exactly what I thought it would be.  </li>
      <li>The handle gets in the way some times, but overall is super useful</li>
      <li>it turns out to be pretty handy though in applying your mascara, especially if you have very short straight lashes like mine...</li>
      <li>The shield part is ackward to use, and the shape doesn&#x27;t really work for me.  </li>
      <li>I really haven&#x27;t used it yet, so</li>
      <li>The shield is also much thicker than I thought it would be.  </li>
      <li>Got it sooner than expected, works like it should and more.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this because it really looked like it would work and keep my mascara off my skin</li>
      <li>If you can figure out how to hold this right up under your bottom lashes and swipe on mascara at the same time, you probably have the dexterity to not need this.</li>
      <li>If I have to clean the mascara off of the shield, I may as well wipe the mascara off my skin with a wet Q-tip.  </li>
      <li>Must have, opposite of what i thought IT REALLY WORKS! .</li>
      <li>The only complaint I have is that the silicone shield is made out of some kind of silicone or vinyl that is really smelly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased a few of them recently and have been completely satisfied with each one.</li>
      <li>It cleans easily and works well to block extra mascara, but it does not curve with the face unless you hold down the wings.</li>
      <li>The shield is actually a rubber like material, not hard plastic.</li>
      <li>The shield is thick and attached by a string like wire that allows the shield to move and be bent easily so you can use it on your lower lashes or bend it to cover your eyelid.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how much time I&#x27;ve spent having to wipe off eyeshadow pigment off of my cheeks and then re-applying my makeup, so this is  ahuge time saver.</li>

    <li> Nothing to rave about but good for the price!</li>
    <li> The curve is like too curved. Like it sticks in the corner of my eye, and still doesn&#x27;t cover my entire under eye. It sets right below my lower lashes. So if you have more rounded eyes, it would probably work for you, but with my almond eyes it doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
    <li> I got this for $3 off of the ELF website. It&#x27;s a bit of a gimmick, but it is useful to catch any fallout and to prevent those unattractive racoon eyes. However, you can also choose to apply your foundation after doing your eye makeup and once you&#x27;re done with your makeup, just run a pad with makeup remover over your undereye area and you&#x27;re fine. The product itself seems to be of good quality, so you&#x27;ll enjoy it if you choose to purchase it, but I do not think it&#x27;s a must.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how much time I&#x27;ve spent having to wipe off eyeshadow pigment off of my cheeks and then re-applying my makeup, so this is  ahuge time saver. I like that you can just rinse and re-use it instead of having something to throw away in the trash. I&#x27;m very glad I bought this and it will never leave my makeup kit.</li>
    <li> it doesnt work as hoped.. this item is just awful and poorly composed. its so hard to lay this properly on ones face. buy only if youre desperate!</li>
    <li> I love Elf cosmetic brushes. I&#x27;ve purchased a few of them recently and have been completely satisfied with each one.</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t exactly what I thought it would be.  The shield part is ackward to use, and the shape doesn&#x27;t really work for me.  The shield is also much thicker than I thought it would be.  I tried it a couple of times but haven&#x27;t used it since.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a good idea when I saw it on a you tube channel, so I purchased it. I really haven&#x27;t used it yet, so officially I can&#x27;t say if it is a usefull tool or not.</li>
    <li> great idea but i need to hold a magnifying mirror, put on shadow, and hold this shield.  only have 2 hands.  will use in front of a stand mirror.  also a bit unwieldy.  great idea though but should have a way to stick to skin.</li>
    <li> If you can figure out how to hold this right up under your bottom lashes and swipe on mascara at the same time, you probably have the dexterity to not need this.</li>
    <li> This works perfectly. I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this and it actually works to keep eyeshadow off my face.</li>
    <li> Must have, opposite of what i thought IT REALLY WORKS! . I am make up artist and i use it all the time.</li>
    <li> The shield is actually a rubber like material, not hard plastic. It cleans easily and works well to block extra mascara, but it does not curve with the face unless you hold down the wings.</li>
    <li> This makes sense but is awkward to use with one had while trying to make up with the other. I&#x27;d like something made of a gel plastic that will stick temporarily under the eye and then peal away when finished. The stick handle does not work for me.</li>
    <li> This may be a great product but I can&#x27;t make it work for me. I end up with more mascara on the shield than on my lashes.</li>
    <li> Got it sooner than expected, works like it should and more. It&#x27;s wabbly plastic and smells really strong like plastic for the first couple weeks.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this because it really looked like it would work and keep my mascara off my skin but it didn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s really floppy, too thick, and hard to control. I found it pretty much impossible to hold in place while applying mascara. The handle is light and kind of like a small brush handle. The shield is thick and attached by a string like wire that allows the shield to move and be bent easily so you can use it on your lower lashes or bend it to cover your eyelid. If you hold it in your hand and shake it, it will flop all over. Maybe with some modifications this would be a great product like a wider, more sturdy, shorter handle and thinner shield. I honestly never use mine. I played with it for a few weeks then gave up trying to make it work. I want to try the lash card and haven&#x27;t yet but I think it would work better than this.</li>
    <li> I purchased these from the e.l.f website directly and I love them. I always had issues with getting my eye shadow everywhere.They were $3.</li>
    <li> This shadow shield is great for catching the dark shadows that end up under your eyes when doing a smokey eye &amp; for preventing mascara from getting on your eyelid &amp; I like how it is washable &amp; reusable unlike the other products that you stick on under your eyes.  The only complaint I have is that the silicone shield is made out of some kind of silicone or vinyl that is really smelly. I washed it &amp; let it air dry but it still smells. I know this item was made in china so I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s not a toxic material that&#x27;s off gassing voc&#x27;s into my bathroom! I hate how you always have o worry about the safety of things made in China.</li>
    <li> Absolutely useless. Don&#x27;t even know what to say about this thing. You have to hold it just right, while you apply mascara or eye shadow. Waste of money, really.</li>
    <li> This could also be a problem from ELF since they don&#x27;t tell you how to use it. Anyway, it&#x27;s a mascara shield &amp; you really have to hold it close to the base otherwise it&#x27;s hard to control. Outside of that it&#x27;s an awesome tool, great to use when adding volume &amp; combing clumps out of your lashes. Everyone that has seen me use it has asked for one, Today I&#x27;m on here buying one to send to my sister.</li>
    <li> I USE A DIFFERENT SHIELD NOW THIS ONE WORKS FOR EYESHADOW FALL OUT BUT I HAVE FOUND BETTER WAYS NOW TO DEAL WITH FALLOUT</li>
    <li> Not easy to use, unfortunately. If I have to clean the mascara off of the shield, I may as well wipe the mascara off my skin with a wet Q-tip.  Will likely not be using this item.</li>
    <li> Works great when applying eye shadow or mascara. Great for first time make up users. Love the silicone shield, product wipes off easily.</li>
    <li> Awesome product great price can&#x27;t wait to use.</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this new tool...it turns out to be pretty handy though in applying your mascara, especially if you have very short straight lashes like mine...</li>
    <li> Makes applying mascara, shadow, or eyeliner on bottom lashes with a clean result.</li>
    <li> I love this. When I saw this I thought what a great idea. I love this you don&#x27;t have to use a tissue or a q-tip to wipe off mascara or eye shadow. Its easy to use and keeps any your make up on perfect. You don&#x27;t have to wipe off any extra mascara off you face. I love this and will order more in the future.</li>
    <li> Broke first time I touched it;(</li>
    <li> This works great. Such a handy tool. The handle gets in the way some times, but overall is super useful</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t find this useful. At least not for me. I feel like I need a third arm to hold everything!</li>
