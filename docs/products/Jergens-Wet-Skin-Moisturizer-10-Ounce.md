      <li>Great time saving product.</li>
      <li>Jergens came out with a great product that takes advantage of that idea and takes it a step</li>
      <li>This product is really great because it cuts the step of applying lotion post shower.</li>
      <li>The excellent price makes this a true keeper.</li>
      <li>The best way is to lotion up your legs first and then use shaving cream.</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>Love this moisturizer!</li>
      <li>really loving this.</li>
      <li>Has a nice scent</li>
      <li>Both are awesome and highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Great moisturizer that has my skin feeling wonderful and smelling nice with a unique scent, bottle is pretty big, generous amount for the price.</li>
      <li>If they could figure out how to make it feel a bit softer rather than tacky, I would like it better.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;ll end up with me having the lotion all over the towel, and having to use more.</li>
      <li>I LOVE THE SMELL AND THE FEEL.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Not only does it make my skin feel great, but it also saves me time in my morning routine!</li>
      <li>My favorite aspect is that it&#x27;s not slippery in the shower and leaves no residue in the shower or on my skin.</li>
      <li>lotion has a pleasant scent, and when you put it on your wet skin, it does a great job of skin softening.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft and moist with a great sheen.</li>
      <li>A good option if price is your main consideration though.</li>
      <li>This is ideal, because it&#x27;s very rich and doesn&#x27;t just turn to nothing on wet skin.</li>
      <li>First, it leaves my skin with a beautiful, soft sheen that makes it look healthy and moisturized.</li>
      <li>The nice bonus and the improvement is that the moisturizing really lasts.</li>
      <li>Overall, this is a great time-saving maintenance product.</li>
      <li>it absorbs great but having to pat dry makes me feel like im making the towel dirtier, faster.</li>
      <li>the label indicates, the lotion can be applied to wet skin, with great effect.</li>
      <li>Such a good combo.</li>
      <li>I had no idea what to expect, but it went on smoothly and was absorbed rapidly.</li>
      <li>So the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; gives a fresher and more natural feeling after it dries.</li>
      <li>Most moisturizers, as I mentioned, work well and cost far less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Jergens moisturizer is my go to for all things lotion, and this green tea oil lotion works very nice.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t want to towel myself off right after putting on lotion.</li>
      <li>and I could feel the lotion working right away.</li>
      <li>I want a lotion that I can put on right after my bathing routine.</li>
      <li>For those whom scent is an issue, this product seems to have the slightly sweet generic &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; scent, though I don&#x27;t notice it more than the first couple of minutes.</li>
      <li>That gives me great results, and I end up with hydrated skin, and able to use much less than if I put it on when I&#x27;m still dripping wet.</li>
      <li>This stuff really works!</li>
      <li>This seems to be meant more for daily upkeep.</li>
      <li>so you really don&#x27;t even need to wait for it to be completely absorbed.</li>
      <li>This does not seem to be meant for super dry skin as you won&#x27;t notice a huge difference after the first use, so don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
      <li>This is a good product but not sure if it&#x27;s for me.</li>
      <li>The scent is very pleasing</li>
      <li>Because this is water based, you really don&#x27;t need to use as much.</li>
      <li>My skin is much softer and remains that way, and I have yet to have issues with staining on my towels from the oil.</li>
      <li>Nearly all these chemicals will be absorbed through the skin.  </li>
      <li>Compared against my new favorite, Cetaphil baby moisturizing oil, I prefer the slightly heavier Cetaphil product for its ability to soak right up and leave the skin feeling silky.</li>
      <li>Jergens has a light, clean fragrance that is not overwhelming and can be easily blended with other scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Initially it seems counter intuitive to towel off that quickly since, being oil-based, it tends to bead up because you are wet, but somehow it works just fine.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product for anyone looking for a high quality lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katiebabs</li>
      <li>I still had to apply a separate lotion to areas that were prone to becoming &amp;#34;ashy&amp;#34;, such as my elbows, with Jergens I do not have to take this extra step.</li>
      <li>The next day my skin is as soft as when I first put the lotion on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I had very dry knees, and while it did help on the first use, it took a few more uses to truly soften them.</li>
      <li>Short of straight up coconut oil, I&#x27;ve yet to find another lotion that will behave itself when you jump out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I feel like it soaks into my skin and really keeps me moisturized through the next day when I use at night.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this, it has replaced several products, because I now have everything I need in one!</li>
      <li>I typically use Olay Quench in-shower moisturizer, and have for years, but the Jergens Wet Skin Moisturizer surpasses that product in many ways.</li>
      <li>I really like Eucerin, both the super thick cream in the tub, and the thinner hand lotion in the bottle.</li>
      <li>, so multiple applications are necessary, which can make the cost-per-use very high.</li>
      <li>The scent is very mild and not perfumey (a big negative for me), and once applied, the lotion is not too oily or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>With regular moisturizers, you need to make sure you are completely dry before applying and then continue to rub in until completely absorbed, which is why I&#x27;m usually too lazy to do so.</li>
      <li>bottom line is Jergens Wet Skin Moisturizer is a product that delivers on its promise, but until the price comes down, I can&#x27;t give it a full recommendation.</li>
      <li>When the weather is dry, or I&#x27;m taking a bath and really giving myself a thorough scrubbing down (like on those hot summer days when I feel all gross and sweaty and greasy from running around all day), my skin tends to feel particularly dry.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m always on the hunt for something new, so I thought I&#x27;d give the Jergens Wet Skin Moisturizer</li>

    <li> My usual routine is to moisturizer after coming out of the shower when your pores are open and your skin still damp. For those whom scent is an issue, this product seems to have the slightly sweet generic &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; scent, though I don&#x27;t notice it more than the first couple of minutes. Smoothed on over all the usual troubled areas of legs, feet, arms and neck, it provided good if not exceptional moisturizing and over the two week period I&#x27;ve used it, I&#x27;ve had no allergic reaction.  Compared against my new favorite, Cetaphil baby moisturizing oil, I prefer the slightly heavier Cetaphil product for its ability to soak right up and leave the skin feeling silky. A good option if price is your main consideration though.</li>
    <li> Great time saving product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always put moisturizer on wet skin (particularly my legs), because as you air dry, it locks the moisture in. Jergens came out with a great product that takes advantage of that idea and takes it a step further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion has a pleasant scent, and when you put it on your wet skin, it does a great job of skin softening. The nice bonus and the improvement is that the moisturizing really lasts. The next day my skin is as soft as when I first put the lotion on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really loving this. The excellent price makes this a true keeper.</li>
    <li> Because this is water based, you really don&#x27;t need to use as much. I found a dollop can do both legs and hands. It does not have the oily or greasy feel that some lotions leave after it dries. So the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; gives a fresher and more natural feeling after it dries. I would recommend this to anyone who has yet to find a lotion that compliments their skin.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE SMELL AND THE FEEL.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I typically use Olay Quench in-shower moisturizer, and have for years, but the Jergens Wet Skin Moisturizer surpasses that product in many ways. First, it leaves my skin with a beautiful, soft sheen that makes it look healthy and moisturized. Olay Quench did not make my skin glow and it has gold glitter that gets deposited on your skin. Also, Olay did not adequately provide moisture. I still had to apply a separate lotion to areas that were prone to becoming &amp;#34;ashy&amp;#34;, such as my elbows, with Jergens I do not have to take this extra step. I also like that I do not have to rinse again after using the product, you can just dry off with a towel.  Jergens has a light, clean fragrance that is not overwhelming and can be easily blended with other scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that that product is a little pricey, and is typically at least one dollar more than Olay for a similar amount of product.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Not only does it make my skin feel great, but it also saves me time in my morning routine! Such a good combo. Will be stocking up!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer that has my skin feeling wonderful and smelling nice with a unique scent, bottle is pretty big, generous amount for the price.</li>
    <li> We are bombarded with endless ads for creams, moisturizers, salves, emolients, etc, all of which will do the trick when needing to hydrate dry skin. I really like Eucerin, both the super thick cream in the tub, and the thinner hand lotion in the bottle. Both are awesome and highly recommended. But I&#x27;m always on the hunt for something new, so I thought I&#x27;d give the Jergens Wet Skin Moisturizer a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the label indicates, the lotion can be applied to wet skin, with great effect. I had no idea what to expect, but it went on smoothly and was absorbed rapidly. The scent is very mild and not perfumey (a big negative for me), and once applied, the lotion is not too oily or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t quite last all day, so multiple applications are necessary, which can make the cost-per-use very high. At nearly $20 per bottle (at the time of this review), it&#x27;s already hard to justify the price tag. Most moisturizers, as I mentioned, work well and cost far less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is Jergens Wet Skin Moisturizer is a product that delivers on its promise, but until the price comes down, I can&#x27;t give it a full recommendation.</li>
    <li> Has a nice scent but i cannot get over putting this on while i am still wet out of the shower then pat drying. i dislike when lotions leave a waxy residue, this one does not. it absorbs great but having to pat dry makes me feel like im making the towel dirtier, faster. my skin does not feel anymore hydrated than when i use my regular aveeno. i will be sticking to my regular routine and not trying to &amp;#34;save&amp;#34; time by applying lotion while still wet.</li>
    <li> Jergens moisturizer is my go to for all things lotion, and this green tea oil lotion works very nice. It&#x27;s best to use after a shower, or even while shaving your legs. The best way is to lotion up your legs first and then use shaving cream. The scent is very pleasing and I could feel the lotion working right away. It&#x27;s not too oily and it lasts all day long. I would recommend this product for anyone looking for a high quality lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katiebabs</li>
    <li> As someone who usually can&#x27;t be bothered moisturizing, this is something that actually gets me to do so. With regular moisturizers, you need to make sure you are completely dry before applying and then continue to rub in until completely absorbed, which is why I&#x27;m usually too lazy to do so. With this product, you can do it before you even get out of the shower. I turn off the water, apply this and then get out. It takes probably only an extra 5-10 seconds, and then I get out and towel off so you really don&#x27;t even need to wait for it to be completely absorbed. Initially it seems counter intuitive to towel off that quickly since, being oil-based, it tends to bead up because you are wet, but somehow it works just fine. My skin is much softer and remains that way, and I have yet to have issues with staining on my towels from the oil. This does not seem to be meant for super dry skin as you won&#x27;t notice a huge difference after the first use, so don&#x27;t expect miracles. This seems to be meant more for daily upkeep. I had very dry knees, and while it did help on the first use, it took a few more uses to truly soften them. If this is used regularly though, a deeper moisturizer will not be needed. Overall, this is a great time-saving maintenance product.</li>
    <li> This is a good product but not sure if it&#x27;s for me.</li>
    <li> Does not dissolve in water. When the weather is dry, or I&#x27;m taking a bath and really giving myself a thorough scrubbing down (like on those hot summer days when I feel all gross and sweaty and greasy from running around all day), my skin tends to feel particularly dry. I want a lotion that I can put on right after my bathing routine. This is ideal, because it&#x27;s very rich and doesn&#x27;t just turn to nothing on wet skin. Short of straight up coconut oil, I&#x27;ve yet to find another lotion that will behave itself when you jump out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do ignore the instructions. I don&#x27;t want to towel myself off right after putting on lotion. That&#x27;ll end up with me having the lotion all over the towel, and having to use more. Instead, I&#x27;ll lightly dry off the bulk of the water, and immediately moisturise afterwards. That gives me great results, and I end up with hydrated skin, and able to use much less than if I put it on when I&#x27;m still dripping wet.</li>
    <li> I like the concept of this lotion, and it does work as advertised, but I found it to be sticky/tacky on my skin for the remainder of the day.  If they could figure out how to make it feel a bit softer rather than tacky, I would like it better.  That being said, I don&#x27;t think I would be it again until &amp;#34;new &amp; improved&amp;#34; comes out.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer! It leaves my skin feeling soft and moist with a great sheen. I highly recommend this, it has replaced several products, because I now have everything I need in one!</li>
    <li> If you care about the environment and your health, why would you use a product that is not natural and an output of industrial and polluting processes?  Nearly all these chemicals will be absorbed through the skin.  Here is a list of ingredients from the Jergens site as it is currently MIA on amazon product page.  (Apart from a few drops of sunflower oil and green tea, it&#x27;s all industrial chemicals including forms of aluminum):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WATER, GLYCERIN, MINERAL OIL, ETHYLHEXYL ISONONANOATE, ETHYLENE/PROPYLENE/STYRENE COPOLYMER, ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, CETEARETH-20, METHYLPARABEN, FRAGRANCE, BUTYLENE/ETHYLENE/STYRENE COPOLYMER, PHENOXYETHANOL, MAGNESIUM ALUMINUM SILICATE, ETHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, HELIANTHUS ANNUUS (SUNFLOWER) SEED OIL, CAMELLIA SINENSIS LEAF EXTRACT, BLUE 1, YELLOW 10.</li>
    <li> This product is really great because it cuts the step of applying lotion post shower. I feel like it soaks into my skin and really keeps me moisturized through the next day when I use at night. My favorite aspect is that it&#x27;s not slippery in the shower and leaves no residue in the shower or on my skin.</li>
