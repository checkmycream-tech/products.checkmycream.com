      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>it is very effective.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never used anything else as effective as this!  </li>
      <li>This has a bit of a smell to it (my husband described it as a good smelling aftershave).</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is fairly drying considering it contains salicylic acid</li>
      <li>Makes my pimples smaller,flatter, and faster to pop or just disappear and its easy to use on the go!!</li>
      <li>and I have been very pleased with it</li>
      <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
      <li>I need to apply it once in the morning and once at night for it to be effective on my pimples.</li>
      <li>I have tried almost every popular drugstore brand on the market</li>
      <li>This product does help minimize my acne spots but not as effective as others have reviewed.</li>
      <li>It also has a nice smell.</li>
      <li>It is a great product - works well and doesn&#x27;t try out your skin too much!</li>
      <li>For the first time in my life after using this product, I can wake up in the morning knowing my skin will look great.</li>
      <li>I felt like it brought out more acne instead of resolving the acne I was trying to treat.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a terrible smell and it does go away</li>
      <li>I mostly use it at night.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Refreshing, not greasy, fresh taste, good</li>
      <li>Plus the ingredients are better.</li>
      <li>This cream is okay.  </li>
      <li>When I run out, I will be sure to order it again.</li>
      <li>Personally, I love that it does not irritate my skin at all...</li>
      <li>/&gt;I will admit that I didn&#x27;t really love the smell of this stuff at the beginning...</li>
      <li>I have tried MANY blemish products over the years.</li>
      <li>It works pretty good.  </li>
      <li>and I think it makes a huge difference on my skin.</li>
      <li>This product is not fragrance free; may be that&#x27;s the reason.</li>
      <li>Works well and makes the skin look brighter and acne free.</li>
      <li>I have really been impressed with Burt&#x27;s Bees facial products.  </li>
      <li>Ok I tried everything natural you can think of and even made my own face wash to get rid of my acne</li>
      <li>I think the product is good for many who is concerned with the ache or any facial problem.</li>
      <li>Im excited</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried every over-the-counter spot treatment out there including one from Proactive &amp; some various home remedies, and this one by far works the best.  </li>
      <li>really helped w the more cystic pimples.</li>
      <li>Overall, I am satisfied with it though I have noticed that my skin seems to become accustom to it, in that if I use it frequently for awhile its effectiveness greatly diminishes.</li>
      <li>I found putting it on the whole area created more bumps.</li>
      <li>This is probably the best drugstore spot cream I&#x27;ve used and that&#x27;s including Proactiv, AcneFree, Clean and Clear, Clinique, The Body Shop Tea Tree, Neutrogena, Boots and a myriad other ones I&#x27;ve tried for my persistent acne over the years.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a gentle yet really fast and effective spot treatment.</li>
      <li>This works well at helping breakouts heal quickly.</li>
      <li>This product grows zits quickly.</li>
      <li>Wow...this is the first product that has ever worked for me to help fight my cystic acne!  </li>
      <li>Clean acne spot fast !</li>
      <li>The product is very well dissolving and smooth.</li>
      <li>I have used the Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Acne Solutions before and love the product.</li>
      <li>I know it&#x27;s pricier than just grabbing an acne wash off the shelf, but it&#x27;s so so so worth it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
      <li>I had been purchasing this product locally for a while, but it was a better price on Amazon and came right to my door!  </li>
      <li>The ingredients are also really recognizable and for the most part natural if that&#x27;s a consideration for you.</li>
      <li>Smell is very gentle, not pungent.</li>
      <li>Be consistent.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Burt&#x27;s Bees!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not expensive, so I gave it a try -</li>
      <li>which was a first for me.</li>
      <li>I definitely like the targeted spot treatment better.</li>
      <li>the first couple of nights I used it</li>
      <li>Not magical, but way better than most.</li>
      <li>It smells nice and it gets rid of my zits faster than any other zit cream.</li>
      <li>It is a bit greasy upon application, but I&#x27;ve had nothing but positive results since I started using it.</li>
      <li>This product, and most other Burt&#x27;s Bees products, worked okay for me during my lesser breakouts.</li>
      <li>The effect is good, my wife used the very role, but it seems that the capacity is relatively small, and the price sometimes is not stable</li>
      <li>It also has a texture like lotion which feels great &amp; doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like the other ones do.</li>
      <li>My skin is very reactive to makeup and skin care products and shows it&#x27;s sensitivity through breakouts.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really grateful for this product.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend trying it!</li>
      <li>Now my zits are growing fast.</li>
      <li>I like Burts Bees Acne Spot Treatment because I have found that it really helps to minimize the redness on my cheeks, nose, and chin.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>is it real ?</li>
      <li>However, since Lush products are known to be pricey (but moderately affordable), I wanted to look for a much more affordable product.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and am allergic to pretty much everything.</li>
      <li>In the past, I&#x27;ve experienced burning, itching, and flaking from former acne-solution products.</li>
      <li>, I had trouble falling asleep because it has a pretty strong scent.  </li>
      <li>this\\&quot; FLAWLESSS I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TRYING IT.</li>
      <li>I really highly recommend this cream.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Dry my face out too much or make it too oily and my face gets super irritated.</li>
      <li>Everything else I&#x27;ve tried over the last 15 years has had minimal-to-no success.  </li>
      <li>normally those seem to take forever to go</li>
      <li>Add in normal hormone-balance issues and PH balance issues</li>
      <li>I love this product and as long as you wash your face semi regularly</li>
      <li>I find if I use this on problem areas once a day or every other day, my skin tolerates it just fine.  </li>
      <li>I was very pleased and I am a very hard person to please with ANY acne, wrinkle etc etc</li>
      <li>I started using it; after a week I realized it did not do any good for my adult acne, instead my face was getting worse, and I stopped it.</li>
      <li>Smells way better than most drugstore acne creams, and is less likely to dry in a white crusty layer on your face.</li>
      <li>Many other products she could not use because she would end up with a rash or a red face.  </li>
      <li>So I order the sensitive face wash from burts bees and this and my face!</li>
      <li>For small blemishes it may work better.</li>
      <li>and it works like magic from keeping a small issue turning into a two week noticable blemish on my face.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product. Arrived promptly. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I was waiting for a cream treatment, but got a liquid one (Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Acne Solutions Targeted Spot Treatment) and I didn&#x27;t like it. It smells like licorice or something similar. Usually I don&#x27;t pay attention to the smell of cosmetics, but this treatment has a strong smell and unpleasant for me. Also liquid treatment is hard to apply and it does not work for me.</li>
    <li> Ok I tried everything natural you can think of and even made my own face wash to get rid of my acne I had made black soap mixed with jojoba oil and goats milk powder it didn&#x27;t work for me. So I order the sensitive face wash from burts bees and this and my face! Has gotten so clear so fast less than a week! I usually need a week for my skin to get use to the oils. This works!!! Makes my pimples smaller,flatter, and faster to pop or just disappear and its easy to use on the go!! The smell is kinda weird but I&#x27;m use to it now.</li>
    <li> Wow...this is the first product that has ever worked for me to help fight my cystic acne!  Everything else I&#x27;ve tried over the last 15 years has had minimal-to-no success.  I apply it at least once a day, and when applied early enough, it can usually prevent a blemish from erupting, and for those I don&#x27;t catch soon enough, it helps clear them up in a couple of days instead of a week or two!  (I&#x27;m a slow healer!)  Don&#x27;t hesitate to give it a try!</li>
    <li> I like Burts Bees Acne Spot Treatment because I have found that it really helps to minimize the redness on my cheeks, nose, and chin. I can use it over larger areas of my face as it does not cause any irritation - no burning, itching, tingling, or dryness (and I do have very sensitive skin). I need to apply it once in the morning and once at night for it to be effective on my pimples. I have stubborn acne. Overall, I am satisfied with it though I have noticed that my skin seems to become accustom to it, in that if I use it frequently for awhile its effectiveness greatly diminishes. However, it is the best acne spot treatment I have yet to find.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know what is in this, but seems to work.  Feels great, no sting.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and am allergic to pretty much everything. My breakouts are very hard to clear up without a high priced laser treatment intervention. This product, and most other Burt&#x27;s Bees products, worked okay for me during my lesser breakouts. It did help with my cysts if I was persistent about applying it. It does smell really weird though. It&#x27;s not a terrible smell and it does go away but if you&#x27;re putting it anywhere under your nose, you will smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is fairly drying considering it contains salicylic acid but I could use it a couple nights in a row before the dryness became a problem. Overall, I recommend it to anyone who has extreme difficulty, like me, in finding acne solutions that they aren&#x27;t allergic to. It&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this product for two weeks. I use it under my moisturizer during the day. My skin looks healthier and my acne marks are looking lighter! Im excited bc my acne marks have taken forever to heal. Ive had acne since age 22 and im currently 29. Trust me, ive tried everything. Happy with this product!</li>
    <li> So background to my skin issues: I&#x27;ve had problem skin since I was a teen. In fairness, it&#x27;s not the worst skin ever, but it&#x27;s more that I&#x27;m never without a spot or two on my face and annoying whiteheads on my nose and chin. My skin is very reactive to makeup and skin care products and shows it&#x27;s sensitivity through breakouts. Add in normal hormone-balance issues and PH balance issues and it&#x27;s not fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a gentle yet really fast and effective spot treatment. It&#x27;s not at all harsh and doesn&#x27;t dry out and further irritate the skin to cause more spots like benzoyl peroxide can. The ingredients are also really recognizable and for the most part natural if that&#x27;s a consideration for you. Also unlike some other acne creams, this doesn&#x27;t leave white marks or a white cast on your face if you want to put it on in the evenings and still hang out with people without looking a mess. This also does well under make up as well being totally invisible. This is probably the best drugstore spot cream I&#x27;ve used and that&#x27;s including Proactiv, AcneFree, Clean and Clear, Clinique, The Body Shop Tea Tree, Neutrogena, Boots and a myriad other ones I&#x27;ve tried for my persistent acne over the years.</li>
    <li> I used to use the Burts bees spot treatment in liquid form but my skin got used to that and it would BURN.&lt;br /&gt;This really helped w the more cystic pimples. Didn&#x27;t dry out my skin... and no burning.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this for my teen with some other Burt&#x27;s Bees Acne Solution products. Works well and makes the skin look brighter and acne free. There are still some minor breakouts but not as much as before.</li>
    <li> Refreshing, not greasy, fresh taste, good</li>
    <li> The product is very well dissolving and smooth. But then I guess the quality of it is affected by the user&#x27;s skin. I think the product is good for many who is concerned with the ache or any facial problem. And since it is a trusted brand I would recommend at least trying it since the price is also on reasonable level. Thr arrival was within the dates it expected so well to try it out.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any of the claims that is mentioned in the container.</li>
    <li> The effect is good, my wife used the very role, but it seems that the capacity is relatively small, and the price sometimes is not stable</li>
    <li> no exp date in the product?  is it real ?</li>
    <li> This works well at helping breakouts heal quickly. It&#x27;s not so harsh that it dries out your skin badly, like a lot of other topical treatment creams. It also has a nice smell. It does make my skin a little greasy if I use it over a small area during the day sometimes. It basically just doesn&#x27;t dry all that fast but it&#x27;s not a huge issue. I mostly use it at night.</li>
    <li> I have been mysteriously breaking out since May on my chin. I don&#x27;t know why, but nothing was working. That is until I bought this. The painful pimples are reduced and no longer painful overnight. The pimples go down and are usually gone in a few days. I really highly recommend this cream.</li>
    <li> I have really been impressed with Burt&#x27;s Bees facial products.  I have pretty sensitive skin and have a hard time finding products that dry my skin out too much.  I find if I use this on problem areas once a day or every other day, my skin tolerates it just fine.  I highly recommend trying it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really grateful for this product. My skin started breaking out when I was in 4th grade &amp; my acne continued to follow me into my 20s. I have tried almost every popular drugstore brand on the market (Neutrogena, Clearasil, Biore...etc.) &amp; spent a fortune on prescription gels just to get my acne under control. Nearly all of the products I tried in the past were too harsh for my sensitive skin so I finally went the all natural route with Lush products &amp; got some really positive results within in a couple months. However, since Lush products are known to be pricey (but moderately affordable), I wanted to look for a much more affordable product. Salicylic acid has never worked for me in the past, so I was a bit skeptical with receiving positive results. But! I&#x27;m sooo glad I was wrong about Burt&#x27;s Bees. I finally found an acne-solution product that works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the maximum spot-treatment in combination with Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Natural Acne Solutions 3 Step Regimen Kit when I&#x27;m having bad breakouts, especially when I get cystic acne. Personally, I love that it does not irritate my skin at all...which was a first for me. In the past, I&#x27;ve experienced burning, itching, and flaking from former acne-solution products. It is a bit greasy upon application, but I&#x27;ve had nothing but positive results since I started using it. When I run out, I will be sure to order it again. Thanks Burt&#x27;s Bees!</li>
    <li> When I woke up yesterday I seen I had broke out and I have a photo shoot the next day, so I said oh no I have to try something different because this not going to work. So I went to walgreens looked through all of their acne products and said this is the one. Pricey but who cares if you want beautiful skin. Came home washed my face with the gel cleanser. Then used the spot treatment went to sleep and \\&quot;I woke up like this\\&quot; FLAWLESSS I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TRYING IT. I have combination skin.</li>
    <li> Since I can no longer find the Nature&#x27;s Gate Natural Results Salicylic Acid Acne I have started using this product and I have been very pleased with it, its a great product to have, I would recommend 100%</li>
    <li> I started using it; after a week I realized it did not do any good for my adult acne, instead my face was getting worse, and I stopped it. This product is not fragrance free; may be that&#x27;s the reason.</li>
    <li> I use this cream in the morning and night, and it&#x27;s always helped with breakouts. I like that it&#x27;s all natural and it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already applied on my face. It seemed to work.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my granddaughter who has begun the acne outbreak.  Many other products she could not use because she would end up with a rash or a red face.  This one works when she remembers to use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Feeling too greasy on the face after use in summer,No part of the role of acne</li>
    <li> Not magical, but way better than most. Smells way better than most drugstore acne creams, and is less likely to dry in a white crusty layer on your face.</li>
    <li> This has a bit of a smell to it (my husband described it as a good smelling aftershave). Creamy and doesn&#x27;t sting. Not sure how well it&#x27;s working as an acne treatment since it&#x27;s hard to judge, but definitely moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t irate sensitive skin. Currently using it with Cetaphil foaming face wash and Burt Bee&#x27;s toner.</li>
    <li> I have been only using this for a week, so its hard to say if its going to keep doing the job, but so far so good, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry may face out either which Is a major plus in my book.</li>
    <li> Terrible product. This product grows zits quickly. I used the liquid and this time I ordered the liquid and received this instead. Now my zits are growing fast. This product is terrible. Buy the Burt&#x27;s Bees liquid acne spot treatment. The liquid makes zits disappear in hours. Liquid works, cream does not!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and it helps to heal problem areas extra quickly! I take it everywhere with me in case I need it. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. It smells nice and it gets rid of my zits faster than any other zit cream. Plus the ingredients are better. I prefer that over Clearsil any day.</li>
    <li> Has yet to start with, but the smell is very good. Smell is very gentle, not pungent. After using the hope effect is obvious.</li>
    <li> This product does help minimize my acne spots but not as effective as others have reviewed. For small blemishes it may work better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a variety of over-the-counter acne treatments, with limited results.  I&#x27;ve been applying this spot treatment cream at night to the areas of my face that are prone to breakouts, and again in the morning under my makeup.  It&#x27;s absolutely incredible...it has kept my acne totally under control over the past few weeks!  A small blemish appeared but disappeared by the next day, and a really large, deep pimple started to form, but--amazingly--also went away by the next day.  I&#x27;ve never used anything else as effective as this!  Especially for the cystic pimples...normally those seem to take forever to go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit that I didn&#x27;t really love the smell of this stuff at the beginning...the first couple of nights I used it, I had trouble falling asleep because it has a pretty strong scent.  I seem to have gotten used to it now though.  I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to smells, so other people might not have a problem with it.</li>
    <li> It works pretty good.  I use it for my chest acne and if I put it on regularly it takes the big ones away.</li>
    <li> I get cyst like bumps on my skin at 36 years old since getting off the pill. NOTHING has worked until now. As soon as I feel it building, I dab this on and it absorbs within a few minutes. I wear it to sleep and it works like magic from keeping a small issue turning into a two week noticable blemish on my face. It&#x27;s not expensive, so I gave it a try - now I keep it on hand always! But, for my skin, I only put it on the blemish. I found putting it on the whole area created more bumps. Stick to dabbing it on the problem areas only and you won&#x27;t be sorry, they&#x27;ll dry up in a day or two!</li>
    <li> I have tried MANY blemish products over the years. I have both break outs and eczema on my body which is difficult. Dry my face out too much or make it too oily and my face gets super irritated. Suffice to say, this product has worked wonders at actually calming both problems. For the first time in my life after using this product, I can wake up in the morning knowing my skin will look great. It&#x27;s awesome and I definitely recommend it. I know it&#x27;s pricier than just grabbing an acne wash off the shelf, but it&#x27;s so so so worth it.</li>
    <li> This cream is okay.  I felt like it brought out more acne instead of resolving the acne I was trying to treat.  I definitely like the targeted spot treatment better.</li>
    <li> I tried so hard to like this, but it has done nothing for my skin. I don&#x27;t have bad acne, just a couple of breakouts here or there, whenever I did have a breakout I would use this and I found that it both smelled weird and made my skin super oily.</li>
    <li> Very greasy and doesn&#x27;t dry out a pimple. It leaves a gross residue on the skin and overall doesn&#x27;t work...</li>
    <li> Clean acne spot fast !</li>
    <li> Once in a while I get those really deep pimples- cystic acne.  Usually my Spironolactone keeps things under control, but I bought this when I had a bad one pop up.  It worked fantastically!  It wasn&#x27;t gone overnight, but it dry it up, reduce the redness &amp; swelling overnight, and it got rid of it waaaay sooner than usual.  I&#x27;ve tried every over-the-counter spot treatment out there including one from Proactive &amp; some various home remedies, and this one by far works the best.  It also has a texture like lotion which feels great &amp; doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like the other ones do.</li>
    <li> I hoppy the item Burt&#x27;s bee nature a lance solutions maximum strength spot treatment cream was working for my ances.</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders. Its 97% organic and I think it makes a huge difference on my skin. I love it.</li>
    <li> No differences after use</li>
    <li> I love this product and as long as you wash your face semi regularly it is very effective. I had a spot coming in on my chin and I put a tiny tiny dab of the cream on it two times a day and washed my face once a day in the morning and it stopped getting bigger and started to go away within a day and is completely gone after day three.</li>
    <li> I think they are selling old products. I couldn&#x27;t stand the horrible smell old make up so I threw it away.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me! Been using for two months.</li>
    <li> I started using Burt&#x27;s Bees products a few days ago and I seem to have broken out a little more. Not sure if it&#x27;s due to the products, but I&#x27;m going to keep using it to see if it improves.</li>
    <li> I had been purchasing this product locally for a while, but it was a better price on Amazon and came right to my door!  It is a great product - works well and doesn&#x27;t try out your skin too much! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Took care of zits with the white icky oozy stuff underneath and also I have noticed it just seems that my skin is looking better.  Be consistent.  You can&#x27;t just use something for a few days or a week or 2.  Try it for at least 4 weeks so your body and skin get accustomed to it.  I was very pleased and I am a very hard person to please with ANY acne, wrinkle etc etc creams lotions gels serumsl</li>
    <li> This is to buy for my daughter, she said it&#x27;s very good.</li>
    <li> I have used the Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Acne Solutions before and love the product. It does a great job of what it is created to do. However, my problem is with the seller - Blue Lagoon Beauty. When I have bought previous tubes of this product from a retail outlet like CVS, the bottom of the tube where it is crimped shut, there is an expiration date stamped in this crimping. The tube I received from Blue Lagoon Beauty, it did not come in a box as a new product should and the expiration date was cut off. This suggests that Blue Lagoon Beauty is selling expired product and removing the expiration date so you don&#x27;t know how old the product is that you receive from them. I would not buy from them in the future.</li>
