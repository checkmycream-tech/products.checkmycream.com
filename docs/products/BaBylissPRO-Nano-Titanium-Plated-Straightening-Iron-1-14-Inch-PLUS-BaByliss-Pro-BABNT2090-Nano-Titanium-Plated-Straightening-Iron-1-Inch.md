      <li>Good afternoon, nice to say hello, this is for you please send me the box 4234 goods purchased separately, this is because if the purchase reaches Miami zoom board is taken as a single purchase, and if it passes $ 100 must pay a tax of nationalization.</li>
      <li>It gets my hair nice and straight, and allows me to use a lower temperature to do so.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really a great deal at only  $99</li>
      <li>So far I have been very pleased with this iron.  </li>
      <li>Definitley worth the money!</li>
      <li>so I finally got my own!</li>
      <li>This brand is by far a better product than Chi anyday!</li>
      <li>The Nano Titanium(tm) line fuses advanced technology, elite design, and powerful performance to create a truly groundbreaking set of products.</li>
      <li>My Sally&#x27;s made my hair more shiny and straight.  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve bought several plates of these for me and some family members, all Us are fascinated by the excellent results for beautyfull that is the hair after to use this flat iron</li>
      <li>The actual flat irons are incredible!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light &amp; bouncy with lots of shine &amp; body &amp; the edge design helped me really straighten out my roots</li>
      <li>so worth it at this price</li>
      <li>Each time we got our hair cut, we always noticed how shiny, soft, and healthy it appeared.</li>
      <li>I already do my own relaxer, so now I only plan to go to the salon to get my ends trimmed up.  </li>
      <li>I used a pretty young sexy thing straightener for for about a year...</li>
      <li>These flat irons work great on my naturally wavy, and very frizzy hair!  </li>
      <li>It keeps my hair smooth to the touch and very silky without product or more importantly, EXTRA effort!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an african american woman and I will say by far these are great!</li>
      <li>First off, I bought this one from NewvoBeauty fulfilled by Amazon &amp; I</li>
      <li>I love having a larger one to keep at home</li>
      <li>and the items were exactly as described.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair smooth and soft.  </li>
      <li>For women with poofy hair, this straightener will keep your hair straight all day even in 90% humidity!</li>
      <li>I was unsure at first being that I have never ordered a flatiron from the internet.</li>
      <li>Used the \\&quot;curling\\&quot; iron yesterday for the first time.  </li>
      <li>So if you aren&#x27;t wanting to spend too much money just go for buying the mini!</li>
      <li>the digital settings and the titanium plates look stylish.  </li>
      <li>(  One thing I did love about the Chi which I don&#x27;t like about the BaByliss is that the Chi had a felt material on the outside of the iron where you could hold the iron without burning your hand.  </li>
      <li>I have very straight and thin hair, if I ever use a flatenning iron to make me look more sharp, this is the best ive ever used.</li>
      <li>This is an okay flat iron.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say it doesn&#x27;t work, it just that kind of tools you need to be very careful when using it.</li>
      <li>Shipping Fast, Excelent Product, i Hope to talk more but is a Gift for XMas, later i told you how work the Iron</li>
      <li>I have thick coarse hair and this product is the best!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m an african american woman and I will say by far these are great! I don&#x27;t have to keep straighting my hair and perfect for new growth. Wish I would have known about them sooner!!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Babyliss Pro Nano Titanium 1\\&quot; flatiron.  This is an okay flat iron.  I am african american and have relaxed, mid-back length hair.  This iron straightens my hair quickly with one or two passes.  HOWEVER; it leaves my ends extremely dry, brittle and split.  I got my ends trimmed after the first use and tried it again for the second time, but my ends turned fried again. :(  I even put the iron on the lowest setting. No success.. It provides a little shine but from the reviews I read I expected so much more.  I do like the digital settings and the titanium plates look stylish.  But I want a flat iron that leaves all of my hair completely straight.  I just purchased a Sedu Pro Ionic Ceramic Tourmaline 1-1/2\\&quot; flat iron.  I haven&#x27;t got in the mail yet, but from all of the reviews I&#x27;m anxious to try it!  Hope it doesn&#x27;t dissapoint like the Babyliss Pro Titanium..</li>
    <li> Simplemente la mejor, su calidad no se compara con ninguna. El cable es muy resistente y largo, lo que lo hace ideal para usar en cualquier lugar.</li>
    <li> I got the double straighter pack, because it was only a little bit more expensive than just one. The \\&quot;mini\\&quot; one is actually the same size as a normal one. So if you aren&#x27;t wanting to spend too much money just go for buying the mini! They are both fantastic straighteners! If you are considering whether to get titanium plates or ceramic, go for titanium for sure.  For women with poofy hair, this straightener will keep your hair straight all day even in 90% humidity! I&#x27;ve never had one that does that!</li>
    <li> gave this as a christmas gift for my daughter see used christmas day and it worked just like every one said great product</li>
    <li> This is a very good striaghtener. It works better than the Chi and it costs less. I makes my hari look pin straight, when really my hair is very curly, and thick. I would recommend this straightener to anyone who knows how to use one.</li>
    <li> I love my BaByliss!  At first I was leary to purchase after reading a few reviews where people said they didn&#x27;t get both in their order however, I am please to say I did receive 2.  I love having a larger one to keep at home and I the smaller one which I leave at work or take on vacations. It&#x27;s really a great deal at only  $99 + free shipping!   I use to have the Chi Turbo which I cried when I found out Chi no longer had their awesome exchange policy.  Without a warranty and if it&#x27;s over a year old, they will not replace a broken Chi.  Guess I shouldn&#x27;t have dropped it on the floor. :o(  One thing I did love about the Chi which I don&#x27;t like about the BaByliss is that the Chi had a felt material on the outside of the iron where you could hold the iron without burning your hand.  The Babyliss isn&#x27;t extremly hot on the outside however I definitely do not feel comfortable putting my hand around it.  Still works just the same.    Only major downside is that there is not an automatic timer/shutoff on this one.  I always forget to unplug/turn off so that feature came in handy for me on the Chi.  All and all tho I am quite happy.</li>
    <li> The best flat iron ever.Great for straigthten your hair or even make losse curls. I truly recomend the babyliss pro nano titanium .</li>
    <li> Good afternoon, nice to say hello, this is for you please send me the box 4234 goods purchased separately, this is because if the purchase reaches Miami zoom board is taken as a single purchase, and if it passes $ 100 must pay a tax of nationalization. Thank you for your valuable management:  Andres reina: areina@grupozoom.com</li>
    <li> great product I recommend it 100% it is easy to handle and lightweight, the quality of ironing the hair is like something out of the beauty salon</li>
    <li> Shipping Fast, Excelent Product, i Hope to talk more but is a Gift for XMas, later i told you how work the Iron</li>
    <li> Now my wife loves me more, she happy with her irons the premiere with his mother, sisters, cousins, neighbors hahaha</li>
    <li> Straightener gets hot very quickly and only requires you to go over the hair once. Hair is straightened without fly-away&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I was lucky and I got two plates and in perfect condition. [[ASIN:B0049W1GNU BaBylissPRO Nano Titanium-Plated Straightening Iron, 1 1/4 Inch PLUS BaByliss Pro BABNT2090 Nano Titanium-Plated Straightening Iron, 1 Inch]]</li>
    <li> Worked ok as a flat iron (replacing a generic one....granted an expensive generic one...from Sally&#x27;s Beauty supply) My Sally&#x27;s made my hair more shiny and straight.  Sadly it&#x27;s old and not working as well as it use to.  Biggest issue with these is they ripped my hair!  The 1 1/4 flat I could hear my hair as it went through (mostly the ends) and after only a few uses the ends are more frizzy than they were before.  Used the \\&quot;curling\\&quot; iron yesterday for the first time.  Hair was stuck in the plates after just one try! It plucked my hair out more than it straightened!  Needless to say these will be going back tomorrow!</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever owned.  Leaves my hair smooth and soft.  I love this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron originally about 2 years ago.  I accidentally \\&quot;fried\\&quot; the cord when I let it come in contact with the plates.  When I went on line to look for another one, I saw this offer and jumped on it, because my daughter uses my flat iron a lot.  The company ran out of these double packs, and so they sent me a single flat iron.  Needless to say I contacted them immediately.  They settled the dispute quickly and offered me either a refund of half the price or a second flat iron.  Of course I took the flat iron.      Both flat irons work really well.  And, the new ones have a thick cord (like the kind of cord you find on power tools).  So, the risk of having the cord burn through is greatly reduced.  My hair looks great, it&#x27;s shiny and silky for several days after I use it.  This flat iron is a little more costly, but well worth the money, especially if you touch up your own hair between salon visits.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Babyliss flatiron for over a month now and i absolutely know it is the best I ever purchased. I have the Chi and the Ion from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply but the Babyliss is my favorite now. I was unsure at first being that I have never ordered a flatiron from the internet. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The Nano Titanium(tm) line fuses advanced technology, elite design, and powerful performance to create a truly groundbreaking set of products. Utilizing nano technology and harnessing the high-heat conductivity of titanium, the dryers dry hair quicker and the irons straighten faster, with longer-lasting results. Sleek, soft metallic-toned Ryton® housings withstand ultra-high temperatures, and the well-balanced, ergonomic design ensures sustained comfort while styling. Nano Titanium always delivers style with substance.</li>
    <li> At first I was disappointed because one of the flat irons is smaller than the other; however, I use the smaller, more lightweight one and my daughter uses the regular sized one.  These flat irons work great on my naturally wavy, and very frizzy hair!  This is a good deal for two of them!</li>
    <li> I was a little worried because of the old reviews of people claiming they did not receive both straighteners.. but I am happy to say I received both! and the items were exactly as described. The only thing I was not expecting is that the 1-inch straightener was a lot smaller in length. The picture shows that but I thought it was a perception thing... apparently not. and the description does not provide that info. other than that I love my straighteners and will order another set if/when these ever burn out. &lt;3</li>
    <li> So I was a little nervous reading the poor reviews from customers whose orders were incomplete by only recieving just 1 of the straighteners. My boyfriend and I both have the same hair stylist, and this is the flat-iron he used. Each time we got our hair cut, we always noticed how shiny, soft, and healthy it appeared. So when we saw this deal on Amazon, we knew we had to purchase the duo. We also went ahead and bought it with 1-day shipping. It shipped later that night, and we recieved it the next afternoon. Awesome. And everything was just as it should be. The actual flat irons are incredible! I have thin hair, so I took the slimmer 1-inch plate, and it keeps my hair straight all day long during work. He has very thick and curly hair, and straightens his before work, goes to bed later that night, and after he wakes up the next morning his hair is STILL straight. Awesome product! I would highly reccommend to anyone who wants straight hair.</li>
    <li> First off, I bought this one from NewvoBeauty fulfilled by Amazon &amp; I received both flat irons.  I&#x27;m thinking the bad seller has been removed from Amazon? Just an fyi, if you ever purchase an item that is not as represented contact Amazon &amp; they will take care of it ASAP, I only had that happen once (supposed to get a 6-pack of conditioners &amp; only got one), but this one is fulfilled by Amazon so don&#x27;t be scared to order, I think the issue others were having has been solved.  Now for the flat iron itself...IT&#x27;S AWESOME! I am african american &amp; my hair is relaxed.  I have NEVER been good with a flat iron although I had 3 others, they mostly sat in my bathroom &amp; I usually just curl my hair.  I got a bad haircut &amp; the only way my hair looks nice is flat ironed.  I was using one by ceramic tools which worked ok, but my hair never looked like it did after I came from the salon.  After some research &amp; seeing this was the iron my stylist uses, I decided to go with the babybliss &amp; got more bang for my buck with the 2 pack.  Last night I washed &amp; conditioned my hair, towel dried, sprayed in some detangler, combed it through, then put in a handful of wrapping lotion, combed that through, let my hair air dry for an hour or so, sprayed in some heat protectant, blowdried, then put in about a dime sized amount of heat protectant serum &amp; more heat spray as needed, &amp; flat ironed in 1 inch sections on 375 (I have very fine, thin hair), finished with a little shine spray. Took about 20-30 minutes but my hair came out even BETTER than when I got to the salon! I had a big interview today, so I wrapped my hair up last night, &amp; just touched it up with the flat iron this morning at 340 degrees this time.  My hair looked great! It&#x27;s light &amp; bouncy with lots of shine &amp; body &amp; the edge design helped me really straighten out my roots (just be careful not to burn yourself!) I know it&#x27;s a lot of $$ for a flat iron, but if you go to the salon a lot you&#x27;ll save money in the long run because you won&#x27;t need to go as often! I already do my own relaxer, so now I only plan to go to the salon to get my ends trimmed up.  One of my best Amazon purchases:) Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have very straight and thin hair, if I ever use a flatenning iron to make me look more sharp, this is the best ive ever used. It gets me there quick and easy!</li>
    <li> This is only the second flatiron I own, needless to say it is fabulous! It leaves my hair looking great! ♡♡♡</li>
    <li> My sister got a BaByliss straightening iron a while back and I loved using it so I finally got my own! I&#x27;m so glad it came with two so I can take the smaller one on trips. Works great and does not pull my hair. I have very curly hair and the 375* setting gets my hair done in 15-20 mins.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many different flat iron brands over the years, some even recommended by my hairdresser, yet none of them have worked as well as this BaByliss brand. With only one or two passes, it not only straightens my thick and coarse hair, but it makes it look shiny too. At night, I put my hair into a bun, and in the morning I&#x27;ve been able to straighten it easily again, even though it&#x27;s wavy and crimped - takes no time at all. I use the larger one at home and the smaller one for travel - both work equally well. The only con is that it gets very hot on the outside of the plates, but you don&#x27;t need to hold them to straighten, so it&#x27;s not an issue for me. Well worth the money, very happy!</li>
    <li> So far I have been very pleased with this iron.  I usually get the CHI, but they seem to last only 1 or 2 years.  I decided to try this one because I had a co-worker that said her&#x27;s lasted 5 years and she and her daughters all use it every day.  The price was about what a CHI would cost, but I got 2!  The travel iron is almost as big as the big iron so I gave that one to my daughter.  She loves it and gets better results with this one than her CHI.  We are very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I tried Solia. It didn&#x27;t last long. It went kaput in a short time span.  My stylist uses babybliss. I decided to give it try. I will never go back to Solia again. B.B.  has digital settings, lite weight, titanium plated and heats quickly. I like the digital setting because I don&#x27;t have to worry about the dial changing when I grip with my hand to use. The titanium plate evens out the temp. It  doesn&#x27;t make my hand tired because it&#x27;s not a heavy. This baby works great for my hair. I texturizer my hair, and I wear hair extension sometimes. When I flat iron my hair. My hair texture looks healthy, sleek and shiny. Use a hair protector.</li>
    <li> All I can say is that there is too much hype for this product. It has 3 stars because it&#x27;s just a flat iron, it doesn&#x27;t do more than it ordinarily should. Yes, I got two for less than the price of one which is GREAT, but I still prefer my Babyliss Porcelain Ceramic iron hands DOWN. It keeps my hair smooth to the touch and very silky without product or more importantly, EXTRA effort!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This iron definitely works since my hair is very thick 4B hair (I am black with natural hair that flatirons to BSL) and it keeps my hair down for longer than usual since I sweat in my scalp. BUT, the way my hair feels is definitely not the same. This iron seems to take out moisture from hair in a very weird way and leaves my hair brittle (which is very unusual for me since I flat iron my hair and others very well). I don&#x27;t like to use heavy products while flat ironing hair other than a moisturizing hair strengthener (Sof n&#x27; Free Gro Healthy company if anyone wanted to know :-P) because when I flat iron it leaves the hair soft and not weighed down in grease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all I can advise if you ARE using this iron, just have a SUPER DEEP conditioning session before you flat iron so that you can keep as much moisture as possible to have body and silky strands that people can run their fingers through with ease. What&#x27;s even better is to do a hot-oil treatment before you wash your hair (the day before) then wash, condition, and deep condition the day you will flat iron your hair and you should get great results. Also, for the natural hair ladies are not afraid to blow dry their hair, use a denman brush to detangle very well then blow dry your hair on low heat, NOT high, so that you will feel when your hair is just dry so that you don&#x27;t over dry your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those are my secrets to wonderful flat ironing for black women with natural hair. Good conditioning, careful LOW heat blow-drying (instead of TURBO high heat setting, lol)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought several plates of these for me and some family members, all Us are fascinated by the excellent results for beautyfull that is the hair after to use this flat iron</li>
    <li> This straightener is awesome.  I used a Chi for years but got tired of how long it took to straighten my long, wavey hair. I can now straighten in half the time and my hair stays straight for days with just a little touch up.  I&#x27;ve been very impressed with this product and the price was great, especially for two of them.</li>
    <li> Saw a lot of reviews claiming they didnt get both straightners but I just ordered last month and got both. Way cheaper then buying in a store and they work great!</li>
    <li> Adquirí este producto como regalo para el día de las madres en Ecuador y lo he recibido de forma correcta y a tiempo en mi casilla de correos. El producto llegó en buen estado y completo (las dos planchas). Regalé cada una a mi madre y esposa, quedaron muy contentas.</li>
    <li> I used to be completely sold on Chi straighteners.  I have used them for over 10 years religiously.  Over the past 2 years, I have noticed the quality of the Chi&#x27;s to be on the decline and they just were not getting my hair as straight as my old irons had been.  So I decided to shop around.  I used a pretty young sexy thing straightener for for about a year...it was okay, not great.  Finally one of my coworker raved about her Babyliss straightener, so I decided to give it a try.  I love it!  It gets my hair nice and straight, and allows me to use a lower temperature to do so.  The other products I had to use the highest temp to get anywhere.  Also, the cost is about 1/2 of what I was paying for my other straighteners, so it is still hard for me to believe that this works better.  I am now a convert...good by Chi!</li>
    <li> En realidad todo llego bien y es un muy buen equipo lo recomiendo fue una entrega rápida recomiendo al vendedor</li>
    <li> Very good article, very good deal nice, very good price, item arrived on time, the packaging had an acceptable size</li>
    <li> I love BaBylissPRO Nano straightening irons, so much that I have purchased at least 4 of them now.  Unfortunately the average life span on these seems to be only about a year (and that is at home use by one person, not a salon?T3 Luminous Flat Iron).  I feel for the price and the fact that these are supposed to be pro quality, they should last much longer. I think it&#x27;s time for me to find a new brand.</li>
    <li> This brand is by far a better product than Chi anyday! LOVE it and so worth it at this price</li>
    <li> The price was right, The Girls are having a great time useing the unit and&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recommended this product to many of my friends</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE my BabylissPro straightening iron...does an amazing job every time! I recommend these flat irons to every person I get a chance. Definitley worth the money!</li>
    <li> One of the best purchases....They work wonders on your hair...my daughter has very coarse hair. ..and it looks like she went to the salon to get her hair done. ..it&#x27;s a great purchase</li>
    <li> I ordered for myself and my daughter.  I travel a lot and was going to take my Chi when I travel and use the BaByliss at home, to keep packing at a minimum.  Forget the Chi, it&#x27;s been in a drawer ever since I tried the BaByliss.  My daughter loves hers as well.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say it doesn&#x27;t work, it just that kind of tools you need to be very careful when using it.</li>
    <li> el producto es de excelente calidad y tal cual lo que esperaba de el. Los articulos llegaron a destino en el tiempo justo</li>
