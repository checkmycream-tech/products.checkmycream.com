### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>1812 is the best.</li>
      <li>Perfect set of colognes to carry along!!&lt;br /&gt;Penhaligon</li>
      <li>What a great way to sample great sents!!</li>
      <li>So, this was a great way to figure out which of these not-inexpensive perfumes I would like to order for myself.</li>
      <li>GREAT company that sends this…Buy it, and if you don&#x27;t like any, give them to someone.</li>
      <li>Very nice indeed.</li>
      <li>Penhaligon&#x27;s fragrances are amazing!</li>
      <li>A nice treat for anyone who loves scents!</li>
      <li>This is a non remarkable, fleeting experience.</li>
      <li>Penhaligon&#x27;s is almost always sold out of this set on their website, so I was thrilled to get this!  </li>
      <li>I thought it might be a good idea to try this trial sized collection</li>
      <li>This is a good idea.  </li>
      <li>Two &#x27;good scents&#x27; for men.</li>
      <li>This is an exceptional set of scents for both men and women.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased to find it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure they won&#x27;t mind!</li>
      <li>The women&#x27;s fragrances included are nice and probably will appeal to a variety of noses.  </li>
      <li>Were I to find a perfume from the scent library I liked, I would buy from this company again.</li>
      <li>The packaging is cute and comes with a nice pamphlet detailing each fragrance.  </li>
      <li>mostly for women.</li>
      <li>Oh, this is something I am so glad I got.</li>
      <li>Most of the scents smelt ghastly.  </li>
      <li>The smell is strong but this is something my grandfather would wear.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased the samples as oppose to spending on a full bottle.  </li>
      <li>This was a good way to try a new collection of scents unfamiliar to me.  </li>
      <li>Despite this reputation I am less than impressed.</li>
      <li>Although most were nice,  none of them became my new favorites.  </li>
      <li>Had a great time testing all the scents, only one was not pleasing to my sense of smell.</li>
      <li>are much more appreciated when you don&#x27;t have to wait more than a week for them to be shipped out of the E.U.    </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great introduction to their classic scents - highly recommended for any man or woman.</li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s always iffy buying a perfume without being able to smell it first.</li>
      <li>This collection is one unique pleasure after another.</li>
      <li>No where was that originally mentioned in the description.  </li>
      <li>The vials are of size that are easy to handle and can easily dispense however much you may like to have.</li>
      <li>&#x27;s is well worth the price - you undoubtedly will enjoy.</li>
      <li>I loved several scents and didn&#x27;t care for others.  </li>
      <li>I gave four stars because I felt the scent descriptions were way off, but the quality of the perfumes were superior- obviously quality perfume.</li>
      <li>I have loved more than I have disliked.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend the seller of this little set of perfumes-the product totaled to a four oz perfume for a fraction of the price, the turnaround was fairly quick, and the extended catalog they had was wonderful  </li>
      <li>our favorite is bluebell eau de toilet which was one of princess diana&#x27;s favorite.</li>
      <li>current favorites are Lily + Spice, Bluebell, and Quercus, but it is lovely to have all ten to try and to be able to see how they wear through the day (remarkably well, so far!)</li>
      <li>The masculine perfumes are rather better than the feminine; perhaps I would give 4 stars to Sartorial.</li>
      <li>Definitely would be a good purchase for someone looking for a new fragrance that is not super-common.</li>
      <li>This set is a nice way to try some of Penhaligon&#x27;s different scents and, considering the price of their full-size products, is a decent value.  </li>
      <li>This was a great purchase because it&#x27;s so hard to find a store that sells Penhaligons.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I only bought this and not the $160 bottle of perfume because I am not fond of any of the scents.</li>
      <li>Each vial can provide the user with two to four usages before it is all gone - more than enough to determine which is preferred.</li>
      <li>Since I only opened all of them to sample the scent, I will be able to give this to someone as a gift.</li>
      <li>I am well aware that Penhaligon is considered an exclusive line of fragrances.</li>
      <li>we both love the different scents included in this collection.  </li>
      <li>THEY most likely will  NOT  LIKE EACH SCENT.</li>
      <li>Enjoyed sampling the different fragrances.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really care about gender labeling on perfume and colognes, so I was excited to get this set and try them all out individually before I ordered a full size on their website.  </li>
      <li>This little library sits nicely in my desk drawer at work, as I never remember to put on perfume before leaving the house.</li>
      <li>Someone in the UK wrote a review of Bluebells which could be quoted verbatim here and get straight to the point: it vanishes.</li>
      <li>Thanks for sending it so fast.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really like any of them.  </li>
      <li>Blenheim Bouquet is classic, but Opus 1870 takes me aback every time.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also, the vials come in the cute little tin, as pictured.  </li>
      <li>I am glad I tried these, but I thought it was a little pricey for what I received.</li>
      <li>not a big deal ....not worth it</li>
      <li>On Ebay there&#x27;s a seller doing sort-of the same thing (at a higher price).  </li>
      <li>In short, these old world fragrances (colognes and perfumes) have an uncommon sophistication which is difficult to find among the modern day department store swill.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not only the fragrances are nothing special: they don&#x27;t last on the skin.</li>
      <li>Without trying them, it would be so hard to know what the different scents in the Penhaligon range might work for me, and I was thrilled to find a sample set.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Gift for my wife who was pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;However will reorder in the near future</li>
      <li>It is a fun way to have a different luxury high-end perfume/cologne to wear everyday for 10 days.  </li>
      <li>I first  encountered Penhaligon&#x27;s when my mother returned from a trip to London a few years back.</li>
      <li>The last note is weak, and difficult to describe, but yet no less unique, and lovely.</li>

<li> Each has enough to last at least 5 -10 days (depending on how much you use).  </li>
<li> Its initial stage has notes that set Bluebells apart from any other.</li>
<li> I usually wear Tom Ford, Jo Malone or other high end</li>
<li> The British have some really odd taste if they like this perfume; it smells like it&#x27;s from the cheapest bargain bin of the discount store of discount stores.</li>
<li> Then I found a retailer in Chicago that sells this little set of several varieties of Penhaligon&#x27;s perfumes.  </li>
<li> Penhaligon&#x27;s is a little difficult to find on this side of the pond, but it is totally worth the hunt!</li>
<li> Happy with another Penhaligons product, disappointed that a sample of Bluebell was not included as advertised, the main reason for ordering the sample box, I wanted to see if it was as bad as the talc powder</li>
<li> Needless to say, I did not appreciate it at first.</li>
<li> Now I know that there are other scents out there that I adore.</li>
<li> those reviewers unable to appreciate this fact, I respectfully direct you to the &#x27;Axe&#x27; display case at your local Walmart.</li>
<li> I have narrowed it down to 2 scents.  </li>
<li> This product is half for women and half for men.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s stated in the description, however, that half of the scents are for men and half are for women.  </li>
<li> Disappointing as high end brand.  </li>
<li> A disappointment but a modest investment, at least.</li>
<li> Two of the vials were broken when i received this.</li>
<li> I never complained because, from the awful smell of the box, I knew I didn&#x27;t want replacements.</li>
<li> but unfortunately, Penhaligon&#x27;s is a bit difficult to get in the United States.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product is half for women and half for men. No where was that originally mentioned in the description.  Also beware of the restocking fee if you have to return it.  Also beware you may not get the amount you think you are owed.  I will never purchase from this vendor again.  Buyer Beware.</li>
    <li> Two of the vials were broken when i received this. I never complained because, from the awful smell of the box, I knew I didn&#x27;t want replacements. The British have some really odd taste if they like this perfume; it smells like it&#x27;s from the cheapest bargain bin of the discount store of discount stores. This was a $25 impulse buy I chalk up as a cautionary tale.</li>
    <li> Oh, this is something I am so glad I got. Without trying them, it would be so hard to know what the different scents in the Penhaligon range might work for me, and I was thrilled to find a sample set.&lt;br /&gt;My current favorites are Lily + Spice, Bluebell, and Quercus, but it is lovely to have all ten to try and to be able to see how they wear through the day (remarkably well, so far!)</li>
    <li> Penhaligon&#x27;s is a little difficult to find on this side of the pond, but it is totally worth the hunt! This little library sits nicely in my desk drawer at work, as I never remember to put on perfume before leaving the house. It&#x27;s a great introduction to their classic scents - highly recommended for any man or woman. Of course, since the library contains both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s fragrances, you may have to find someone of the opposite sex to share with. I&#x27;m sure they won&#x27;t mind!</li>
    <li> This is a good idea.  On Ebay there&#x27;s a seller doing sort-of the same thing (at a higher price).  The tiny bottles in the metal case are just enough to try out and find out whether you like a scent.  It works well to dump them into a spray bottle and dilute a bit, then properly perfume oneself.</li>
    <li> What a great way to sample great sents!!</li>
    <li> Enjoyed sampling the different fragrances. Thanks for sending it so fast.</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase because it&#x27;s so hard to find a store that sells Penhaligons. So when I saw this scent library, I immediately purchased it to see what all the fuss was about with this brand. I&#x27;m so glad that I only bought this and not the $160 bottle of perfume because I am not fond of any of the scents. Since I only opened all of them to sample the scent, I will be able to give this to someone as a gift.</li>
    <li> I am well aware that Penhaligon is considered an exclusive line of fragrances. Despite this reputation I am less than impressed. It simply can&#x27;t compare with Chanel, Guerlain, Amouage, Lutens, de Nicolai, or even Estee Lauder. Not only the fragrances are nothing special: they don&#x27;t last on the skin. This is a non remarkable, fleeting experience. The masculine perfumes are rather better than the feminine; perhaps I would give 4 stars to Sartorial. Still, none is a masterpiece.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased the samples as oppose to spending on a full bottle.  The smell is strong but this is something my grandfather would wear.  The type of smell is not very progressive, rather old school.</li>
    <li> I gave four stars because I felt the scent descriptions were way off, but the quality of the perfumes were superior- obviously quality perfume. So it&#x27;s always iffy buying a perfume without being able to smell it first. Were I to find a perfume from the scent library I liked, I would buy from this company again. I do like that the product arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> I first  encountered Penhaligon&#x27;s when my mother returned from a trip to London a few years back. Needless to say, I did not appreciate it at first. However, the years rolled by, the bottle stayed on my nightstand, and it grew on me....but unfortunately, Penhaligon&#x27;s is a bit difficult to get in the United States.  Then I found a retailer in Chicago that sells this little set of several varieties of Penhaligon&#x27;s perfumes.  I was very pleased to find it. I highly recommend the seller of this little set of perfumes-the product totaled to a four oz perfume for a fraction of the price, the turnaround was fairly quick, and the extended catalog they had was wonderful  I intend to use it for Christmas-rare treats from Europe are much more appreciated when you don&#x27;t have to wait more than a week for them to be shipped out of the E.U.    Try it, folks-you will like it.</li>
    <li> I watched Rashida Jones on a trip to London and a visit to Penhaligon&#x27;s and I was intrigued. I ordered this set to try out fragrances that I had never heard of. Very nice indeed.</li>
    <li> Scents just didn&#x27;t thrill me, ultimately, and some were downright cloying. A disappointment but a modest investment, at least.</li>
    <li> I saw these on a show with Rashida Jones visiting the shop in London and thought I would get the samples to try all scents. Not for me...I didn&#x27;t really like any of them.  I usually wear Tom Ford, Jo Malone or other high end so it wasn&#x27;t because I can&#x27;t appreciate quality.</li>
    <li> I collect perfume so when i saw this collection i had to give it a try.  I bought 2 of these.  one for myself and one for my daughter.  we both love the different scents included in this collection.  our favorite is bluebell eau de toilet which was one of princess diana&#x27;s favorite.</li>
    <li> This set is a nice way to try some of Penhaligon&#x27;s different scents and, considering the price of their full-size products, is a decent value.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s stated in the description, however, that half of the scents are for men and half are for women.  The women&#x27;s fragrances included are nice and probably will appeal to a variety of noses.  I can&#x27;t comment on the men&#x27;s fragrances, as my husband has yet to try them.  Also, the vials come in the cute little tin, as pictured.  Definitely would be a good purchase for someone looking for a new fragrance that is not super-common.</li>
    <li> Gift for my wife who was pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> Had a great time testing all the scents, only one was not pleasing to my sense of smell. Now I know that there are other scents out there that I adore.</li>
    <li> Someone in the UK wrote a review of Bluebells which could be quoted verbatim here and get straight to the point: it vanishes. Within 10 minutes, there is not a trace of Bluebells. But in that 10 minutes it goes through stages, as the notes waft off into the ether. Its initial stage has notes that set Bluebells apart from any other. As they disappear, there is an earth tone, forest-like. The last note is weak, and difficult to describe, but yet no less unique, and lovely.</li>
    <li> This was a good way to try a new collection of scents unfamiliar to me.  Although most were nice,  none of them became my new favorites.  I am glad I tried these, but I thought it was a little pricey for what I received.</li>
    <li> In short, these old world fragrances (colognes and perfumes) have an uncommon sophistication which is difficult to find among the modern day department store swill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those reviewers unable to appreciate this fact, I respectfully direct you to the &#x27;Axe&#x27; display case at your local Walmart.</li>
    <li> This is an exceptional set of scents for both men and women. Five for men and five for women. The vials are of size that are easy to handle and can easily dispense however much you may like to have. Each vial can provide the user with two to four usages before it is all gone - more than enough to determine which is preferred. Going on a trip? Perfect set of colognes to carry along!!&lt;br /&gt;Penhaligon&#x27;s is well worth the price - you undoubtedly will enjoy.</li>
    <li> ANYONE BUYING THIS PRODUCT SHOULD KNOW THAT THEY most likely will  NOT  LIKE EACH SCENT. THE VIALS ARE TINY AND JUST SAMPLES. DO NOT PURCHASE AT $200.00 ever.</li>
    <li> Penhaligon&#x27;s fragrances are amazing! This collection is one unique pleasure after another. Blenheim Bouquet is classic, but Opus 1870 takes me aback every time.&lt;br /&gt;The wife loves the ladies scents, especially Artemisia and Malbah. Get it!</li>
    <li> Disappointing as high end brand.  Most of the scents smelt ghastly.  I thought it might be a good idea to try this trial sized collection but this one not a winner.</li>
    <li> mostly for women. Two &#x27;good scents&#x27; for men. GREAT company that sends this…Buy it, and if you don&#x27;t like any, give them to someone. 1812 is the best.</li>
    <li> I loved several scents and didn&#x27;t care for others.  So, this was a great way to figure out which of these not-inexpensive perfumes I would like to order for myself.</li>
    <li> not a big deal ....not worth it</li>
    <li> Happy with another Penhaligons product, disappointed that a sample of Bluebell was not included as advertised, the main reason for ordering the sample box, I wanted to see if it was as bad as the talc powder&lt;br /&gt;However will reorder in the near future</li>
    <li> This has 5 &amp;#34;women&amp;#34; scents and 5 &amp;#34;men&amp;#34; scents.  I don&#x27;t really care about gender labeling on perfume and colognes, so I was excited to get this set and try them all out individually before I ordered a full size on their website.  Penhaligon&#x27;s is almost always sold out of this set on their website, so I was thrilled to get this!  I have loved more than I have disliked.  I have narrowed it down to 2 scents.  It is a fun way to have a different luxury high-end perfume/cologne to wear everyday for 10 days.  Each has enough to last at least 5 -10 days (depending on how much you use).  The packaging is cute and comes with a nice pamphlet detailing each fragrance.  A nice treat for anyone who loves scents!</li>
