      <li>I just love it so much that I can&#x27;t stop touching my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But those other masks are merely nice where the Black Rose mask is awesome.</li>
      <li>Just like the others, it is saturated in the amazing serums that it came in the package, it stays put on my face, and my skin is left looking hydrated, smoother, and more youthful.</li>
      <li>This mask sinks in amazingly well, leaves no sticky residue, and makes my face noticeably more soft and bright.</li>
      <li>Since my sheet mask stash was kinda low, I bought these because of the good reviews that I read.</li>
      <li>Absolutely saturated with silky, softening, refreshing and non-irritating serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It fit really well with my face shape too!</li>
      <li>masks smell strongly of rose, which I&#x27;m not normally crazy about, but these masks work so well that I have developed very positive feelings towards the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>My first time trying Hey!</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s calming on my sensitive skin and refreshing.</li>
      <li>This Black Rose sheet mask is truly a special beauty enhancer and I am forever keeping this product stocked on my vanity because I don&#x27;t want to go without them!</li>
      <li>I do not remove the plastic sheet right after unfolding it.</li>
      <li>I just remove the mask before applying it to my face, I rarely have an issue with it sticking to itself, but sometimes I like to stick it to my forehead first before removing the backing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Took me a few minutes to figure it out, but when I removed it, my skin looked AMAZING!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also impressed by the generous helping of serum in the packet – I not only had plenty to cover my face, but was able to use the leftovers on other problematic dry spots like my knees and elbows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My face feels so soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>I just used this mask for the first time, and I have to say,</li>
      <li>These masks make my face feel significantly more hydrated, and the felling lasts through the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Been on Amazon for years, first review here for Pinkgo Girl...</li>
      <li>It makes your skin feel extremely soft, smooth and firmer afterwards.</li>
      <li>First timer for this product</li>

      <li>Other sheet masks are nice, but this was the fist time I&#x27;ve ever noticed an immediate difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;These masks are absolutely drenched in essence, with more than enough to spread some around the neck and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; area.</li>
      <li>I have fair skin and sometimes will get adult acnes due to stress.</li>

      <li>I like it so much......</li>
      <li>Since there was so much essence, I just smacked the rest of it onto my neck and arms.</li>
      <li>This new black version is amazing too.</li>

      <li>, it works way better than other hyaluronic acid moisturizers on my oily, somewhat dehydrated skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Admittedly, I flubbed it the first time before I finally got it right.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really hard to fit it comfortably and cover my whole face.</li>

    <li> Been on Amazon for years, first review here for Pinkgo Girl...love this mask, Bought it twice already. I have fair skin and sometimes will get adult acnes due to stress. This mask did made noticeable changes to my skin, I was told that my skin looks better than it was months ago. Will definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> Smells great (like roses) and leaves your skin feeling moist and dewy.  It is not a miracle worker so don&#x27;t expect that.  This I a nice little pick me up for stressful days or when you want your skin soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom</li>
    <li> I just used this mask for the first time, and I have to say, I was confused on how to put it on.  The packet is written in Chinese or Japanese possibly and there are no English directions.  Perhaps the seller could put a note in with the package explaining the correct way to apply this mask.  Once I put it on my face, I was in absolute love!  It smells delicious and I could just feel my face becoming hydrated.  I took the extra bit of product and put it all over my neck.  I am really excited about this mask and will recommend to all my friends!</li>
    <li> I like it so much...... and I use it everyday!!!</li>
    <li> My first time trying Hey! Pinkgo Girl and I am hooked.  I can&#x27;t wait to try more!</li>
    <li> My face seriously does. It helps to hydrate my combo (dry/oily), acne prone skin. I have had no problems with breakouts. I use this mask whenever I feel my skin&#x27;s dry or after a green peel. The mask smells amazing and full of serum--so don&#x27;t let all that extra serum in the pouch go to waste. I had to deduct a star because the mask is a bit hard to handle (I&#x27;m used to another mask sold by my esthetician which was a lot easier to place), but that&#x27;s it. I am so thrilled to have discovered Hey! Pinkgo Girl brand -- it is a much cheaper, but equally as effective as other expensive brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I love these products.  I have seen a marked improvement in my skin even after one use.  The masks are extremely moist, and I have used the extra on my midsection (and it worked!).</li>
    <li> Love it! With my first use I felt my skin was more smooth and soft and noticed my skin was brighter. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely saturated with silky, softening, refreshing and non-irritating serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike most masks, it is extremely thin and practically transparent when put on. But it remains snug against the skin and doesn&#x27;t dry out quickly like other ones do. You can keep it on for an easy 15-20 minutes and receive a relaxing yet invigorating treat for your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to try their other versions.</li>
    <li> Amazing product!  My face feels so smooth and youthful and rejuvenated I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you.  These easy to use masks are so easy  you basically set it and forget it,  15 minutes later Wala you have amazing feeling skin.</li>
    <li> This mask is amazing. Truly a &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; mask in terms of moisturizing, which is a first. My skin absolutely loves the tremella extract that is the main ingredient in these Hey! Pinkgo Girl masks, it works way better than other hyaluronic acid moisturizers on my oily, somewhat dehydrated skin. These masks make my face feel significantly more hydrated, and the felling lasts through the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These masks are absolutely drenched in essence, with more than enough to spread some around the neck and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; area. They&#x27;re a lovely thin material that&#x27;s fairly see-through, which lowers the &amp;#34;creepy murderer&amp;#34; look of face sheet masks. They fit well on my face, which I assume is fairly normal sized, but I have a small forehead, so there&#x27;s excess material around my scalp line. I like to snip the center of the upper lip portion and the center chin, then pull those areas closer together to get the mask covering as much of my lower face as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The masks come with a plastic backing that makes them easier to unfold. I just remove the mask before applying it to my face, I rarely have an issue with it sticking to itself, but sometimes I like to stick it to my forehead first before removing the backing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The masks smell strongly of rose, which I&#x27;m not normally crazy about, but these masks work so well that I have developed very positive feelings towards the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is in pretty good condition these days, but living in the desert makes it hard to keep my face hydrated. I also have naturally oily skin, so too little moisture and I over-produce oil, but heavy moisturizers tend to break me out. This mask sinks in amazingly well, leaves no sticky residue, and makes my face noticeably more soft and bright. Other sheet masks are nice, but this was the fist time I&#x27;ve ever noticed an immediate difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other masks I like are Innisfree It&#x27;s Real (Rose, Mankua Honey, Rice and Bija), Benton Snail Bee, and Tosowoong Pure (Propolis and Snail). But those other masks are merely nice where the Black Rose mask is awesome.nail Bee, and Tosowoong Pure (Propolis and Snail). But those other masks are merely nice where the Black Rose mask is awesome.</li>
    <li> Best sheet mask ever! Amazing product for such an affordable price. I&#x27;ve an avid sheet mask addict because I love how they just pick your skin up whenever it gets dull or dry. Since my sheet mask stash was kinda low, I bought these because of the good reviews that I read. I was not let down at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am officially in love with this sheet mask. I received this product yesterday and eagerly used a sheet mask today. The sheet mask was incredibly thin and saturated with essence. Since there was so much essence, I just smacked the rest of it onto my neck and arms. I was sincerely amazed with how thin the sheet mask was. It fit really well with my face shape too! I left the mask on for 20- 25 minutes and then removed and patted the rest of the essence into my skin. Surprisingly, the essence absorbed really quickly into my skin. Usually most face masks leave a slightly tacky feeling on my skin since the essence doesn&#x27;t absorb all the way, but wow, just imagine my surprise when my skin was left smooth and silky after patting the rest of the essence in. My skin felt moisturized and definitely happy, which makes me a happy camper as well.I seriously am in love with this mask now and definitely would try out other Hey! Pinkgo Girl masks as well.</li>
    <li> I just tried the new black version. Wow! They did it again! I love the blue (triple HA) version and have been using it for a while. This new black version is amazing too. The mask fits. It’s thin, comfortable; I almost forget that I’m wearing it. (See the photo attached.) The scent is subtle and so soothing. Wearing it has become part of my nighttime routine and I can see and feel the difference. My skin is softer, smoother and feels super healthy. Best masks I have ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Because the mask really is super thin, I am gentle and careful when unfolding it. I do not remove the plastic sheet right after unfolding it. Instead I put the mask with the plastic sheet together on my face (cloth side on my face), and then remove the plastic sheet. This method works for me every time.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift and I am very impressed! My face feels like a drinking fountain when I am applying these masks. It makes your skin feel extremely soft, smooth and firmer afterwards. I just love it so much that I can&#x27;t stop touching my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When applying, I have no issues at all due to the thinness of the sheet mask. It fits on your face nice and securely and very comfortably. My favorite part is that it smells like a rose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this face mask is amazing! It comes with plenty of essence in a packet so you can apply the remaining on your neck, arm, or anywhere else on the body.</li>
    <li> Pinkgo Girl masks seriously never fall short of greatness! I have already purchased and fallen in love with three of their other masks, and this one is literally just as great! Just like the others, it is saturated in the amazing serums that it came in the package, it stays put on my face, and my skin is left looking hydrated, smoother, and more youthful. Pinkgo Girl masks are my favorite!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**FTC-I received free or discounted product in exchange for providing an unbiased review.</li>
    <li> First timer for this product and I love it.  Took me a few minutes to figure it out, but when I removed it, my skin looked AMAZING!  Just purchased a few other &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34;.  Looking forward to trying those out.</li>
    <li> Winter is always so hard on my skin, leaving it dry, tight, and itchy. I&#x27;m always searching for products that will help with this, though most that even partially work tend to be thick, heavy creams with strong odors that leave my face feeling greasy. Definitely not what I&#x27;m looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know what to expect when I tried these masks, but I have to say, the results are impressive! My skin already feels smoother and more elastic, and not greasy at all, which is a big plus. Beyond that, the serum has a light, pleasant fragrance with no chemical odors at all. I&#x27;m also impressed by the generous helping of serum in the packet – I not only had plenty to cover my face, but was able to use the leftovers on other problematic dry spots like my knees and elbows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admittedly, I flubbed it the first time before I finally got it right. For other users, be sure to apply the mask to your face BEFORE you remove the backing. Trust me, you&#x27;ll save yourself a lot of unnecessary frustration. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended, and a product I&#x27;ll be ordering again!</li>
    <li> This sheet mask... oh my, where do I even begin? My face feels so youthful. *I* feel youthful. It&#x27;s definitely left me feeling moisturized! My face feels so soft and smooth. :) When I unrolled the first mask there was so much serum, they don&#x27;t skimp which is awesome. I live in Texas so my face is always under constant attack from the heat and humidity... this was the perfect thing to help my skin, that&#x27;s for sure. Needless to say, after the first sheet mask, when I woke up the next morning my skin looked loads better... even without makeup, which is a big deal for me since I spend so much money on other make ups like foundations and etc. I really think with continued use of these sheet masks (mmm and they smelled so good to boot) I doubt I will even need the toxic chemical-filled foundations and cover up! Lol. I just loved how refreshed I felt after using it. And that feeling lasted well-past the next morning too. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These sheet masks are thin, and they weren&#x27;t at all uncomfortable; they conformed wonderfully to my face and stayed on with no problems at all. In fact they&#x27;re so easy, I just left it on for awhile and let it absorb while I watched an Office re-run and apart from all the silly office antics, I felt like I was at the spa! Lol. No but seriously, this mask will be a boon to my skin care regimen and it made me feel so luxurious-- you cannot beat the price for this kind of mask. Also, I was surprised at how much extra serum was in the package that I also put some on my trouble spots like on my neck, elbows, arms, and even my knees and feet (which definitely needed it! lol) and I&#x27;ve never felt more beautified! And honestly, it makes me feel more pretty and like, feminine? This Black Rose sheet mask is truly a special beauty enhancer and I am forever keeping this product stocked on my vanity because I don&#x27;t want to go without them! Lol. I can only imagine how much better my skin will be after months of using this... :) I am so happy! Thank you Hey! Pinkgo Girl! I LOVE IT.

    <li> Moisturizing and smell lovely, but the shape of the mask is definitely intended for Asian faces. The nose is really short and the eye holes are wide but thin. It&#x27;s really hard to fit it comfortably and cover my whole face.</li>
    <li> Super messy, but incredibly effective. I recommend you tie your hair back since it has flaps to go over your ears.</li>
    <li> great price wonderful results</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product! I&#x27;m in my early 40&#x27;s and winter takes a toll on my skin! I have tried so many (expensive!) products to take care of the dry patches on my face and nothing has worked...until I used this mask! It&#x27;s calming on my sensitive skin and refreshing. The results are also long lasting!</li>
    <li> Cute packaging and great product. Love how the serum makes my skin softer. Easy to put on and take off.</li>
