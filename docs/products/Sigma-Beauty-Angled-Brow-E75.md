      <li>I liked this brush</li>
      <li>My quest for an effective brow brush continues....</li>
      <li>When I use it, it just kind of bends and collapses  </li>
      <li>so that was nice.</li>
      <li>Worth the money!!!</li>
      <li>Perfect high quality brow brush.</li>
      <li>the shadow application its smooth and look spectacular!</li>
      <li>it is very easy to use , very soft brush and perfect for the eyebrows , I recommend it</li>
      <li>but this one is much better.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Love this brush for my brows.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I will also recommend this :)</li>
      <li>I guess it&#x27;s okay for &amp;#34;filling in&amp;#34</li>
      <li>It had held up to washing very well and remains a great stiffness for doing eyebrows.</li>
      <li>,, I use it to conceal under my eyebrows,,,, customer service was amazing,, even got a free gift......</li>
      <li>I like my ELF angled brush better than this one (for filling in brows).  </li>
      <li>Never disappointed!</li>
      <li>so it is more precise but takes more blending/filling the get the desired application.</li>
      <li>The hair is strong and the brush do the job.</li>
      <li>At first I did use it to fill my eyebrows which it was effective for</li>
      <li>It holds both powder and liquid products fine.</li>
      <li>This brush is fantastic.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not terribly picky, but this is an overall good quality brush.  </li>
      <li>After reading rave reviews about this angled brush I decided to buy it to apply eyebrow powder but compared to the one that came with an old kit that fell apart, this does not do a good job.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s dense enough too that the product goes on very nicely.</li>
      <li>nothing special.</li>
      <li>Love how precise it is.. Will definitely repurchase:)</li>
      <li>The order came really quick as well</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s tiny shape makes it very precise!</li>
      <li>Buy all sigma brushes, it&#x27;s worth the prices</li>
      <li>I was hoping to replace an old angled brow brush that I got from Sephora many years ago.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money</li>
      <li>sooooooo much sigma,,, I love u guys so much......</li>
      <li>This one is so much better is so soft n dense.</li>
      <li>Just the right size and stiffness.</li>
      <li>I have found that this does better with powders than with gels-my brow gel barely shows up when I apply with this vs. my MAC.</li>
      <li>maybe better for bare areas.</li>
      <li>BUT, this brush is such a great shape and size (very similar to my slanted eyeliner brush from Sephora), that I now use it as a multi-purpose tool around the eyes and brows.</li>
      <li>this is good so you can add color to build the brows naturally and gradually as to not end up with over filled or too dark brows.</li>
      <li>The brush is very soft and dense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for brows!!!</li>
      <li>I love these brushes and have them in in the performance eyes kit and the mr bunny essential sigma max kit.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an eyebrow brush, and overall it is just okay</li>
      <li>I love it, and yes I would definitely recommend it....</li>
      <li>This is the first Sigma brush that I don&#x27;t like.  </li>
      <li>a very fine precise and small angled brow brush for applying shadow to fill in the brows.</li>
      <li>This brush is nice and thin so it&#x27;s pretty easy to use when I&#x27;m filling in and sculpting out my eyebrows</li>
      <li>I really like this brush.</li>
      <li>if you don&#x27;t have much to fill in.</li>
      <li>Shipped fast.</li>
      <li>But for those of us who really need to define our brows to give it shape, we will probably have to look elsewhere.</li>
      <li>the brush is dense and just stiff enough to hold up to its purpose definitely one of the best brow brushes you can buy.</li>
      <li>although I love my other brand when it comes for brushes, but just to try another brand.</li>
      <li>It is good for a defined look but it takes quite a while to achieve as the brush is very small.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Love this little brush!</li>
      <li>very soft you can use it as eyeliner</li>
      <li>I did not find the bristles stiff enough to give a nice, even application.  </li>
      <li>It works pretty well, the bristles are stuff enough for brow work.</li>
      <li>I only wish that it was a little more...</li>
      <li>too soft for brows.</li>
      <li>Too soft to use for brows.</li>
      <li>I think the problem is it&#x27;s way too soft.</li>
      <li>I returned this brush because I wanted to put powder eyeshadow over my eyepencil, and the bristles were too soft.  </li>
      <li>I got this brush to replace an old one that was fraying at both ends.</li>
      <li>just&lt;br /&gt;too soft for how I wanted to use it.</li>
      <li>The overall brush was wonderful, just disappointed in the packaging.</li>
      <li>Will definitely buy a new one.</li>
      <li>I never believed in spending the extra few bucks for a special eye brow brush...</li>
      <li>It is also much shorter than I expected.</li>
      <li>Since I have pretty short and thin eyebrows, this little thing helped me to change them completely:))</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I paid $18 for the dip brow product by AB and it didn&#x27;t look nearly as good applied as when I started using this brush. Prior to the Sigma e75 I was using a standard angled brush bought at the store and was frustrated by the results. This brush reduced screw ups and application time. Love it.</li>
    <li> Perfect high quality brow brush.</li>
    <li> This is the first Sigma brush that I don&#x27;t like.  It is too thin and too flimsy and would add time to my routine in the morning.  I like my ELF angled brush better than this one (for filling in brows).  Sent it back.</li>
    <li> Great tool for eyebrows! Sigma makes the best brushes. MAC comes in a close second.</li>
    <li> I owned a M.A.C 266. This one is so much better is so soft n dense.</li>
    <li> Very narrow and firm enough to fill in brow or extend.  A little pricey but just the size I needed.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I returned this brush because I wanted to put powder eyeshadow over my eyepencil, and the bristles were too soft.  It&#x27;s a very nice brush, just&lt;br /&gt;too soft for how I wanted to use it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s...........another eyebrow brush. It is also much shorter than I expected. After hearing a beauty guru on YouTube rave about it I decided to order it. It&#x27;s an eyebrow brush, and overall it is just okay nothing special. I have found that this does better with powders than with gels-my brow gel barely shows up when I apply with this vs. my MAC. I will use it when my other brushes are dirty but didn&#x27;t change my life.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush! At first I did use it to fill my eyebrows which it was effective for but I&#x27;m now hooked on Anastasia Brow Wiz so there&#x27;s really no need for it on my eyebrows. BUT, this brush is such a great shape and size (very similar to my slanted eyeliner brush from Sephora), that I now use it as a multi-purpose tool around the eyes and brows. I dip it in a small amount of liquid concealer to even out winged eyeliner if I&#x27;m made a mistake, and also for concealer around the eyebrows. It&#x27;s tiny shape makes it very precise! It holds both powder and liquid products fine.</li>
    <li> Love this little brush! Great for brows or even lips! Love how precise it is.. Will definitely repurchase:)</li>
    <li> although I love my other brand when it comes for brushes, but just to try another brand. This product is also doing great for me. I will also recommend this :)</li>
    <li> This brush is great for eyebrows. I use it daily with my eyebrow powder. I even use it some for eyeshadow. Well worth the money</li>
    <li> JUST BUY ANY SIGMA BRUSH, YOU WONT REGRET IT. THEY ALL WORK GUD. I AM A HAPPY CUSTOMER AND I WILL BUY THESE AGAIN!!!!</li>
    <li> This brush is nice and thin so it&#x27;s pretty easy to use when I&#x27;m filling in and sculpting out my eyebrows A+!</li>
    <li> very soft you can use it as eyeliner</li>
    <li> a very fine precise and small angled brow brush for applying shadow to fill in the brows. it is quite small so it is more precise but takes more blending/filling the get the desired application. this is good so you can add color to build the brows naturally and gradually as to not end up with over filled or too dark brows. the brush is dense and just stiff enough to hold up to its purpose definitely one of the best brow brushes you can buy.</li>
    <li> Love it. Shipped fast.</li>
    <li> I did not find the bristles stiff enough to give a nice, even application.  It was also thinner than I thought it would be.  I plan on using this as an eyeliner brush instead.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this brow brush I, thought that it was going to be dense and stiff brush. But no...it is very thin and lacks the rigidness needed to define brows or to apply brow powder with. When I use it, it just kind of bends and collapses  - there is very little resistance to it. I guess it&#x27;s okay for &amp;#34;filling in&amp;#34; brows...if you don&#x27;t have much to fill in. But for those of us who really need to define our brows to give it shape, we will probably have to look elsewhere. My quest for an effective brow brush continues....</li>
    <li> I was hoping to replace an old angled brow brush that I got from Sephora many years ago. This one did NOT do the trick. For me, it does not have enough hair...I like my eyebrow brush to be a little thicker. This may be okay with very thin eyebrows.</li>
    <li> BEST BRUSH EVER! it is really good to do your brows. buy it you won&#x27;t regret</li>
    <li> I really like this brush. Perfect.</li>
    <li> I never believed in spending the extra few bucks for a special eye brow brush...but I kept reading about it on beauty tip websites.  So I decided to buy one off amazon... once I used the Sigma E75, I could immediately notice the difference on application and ease of use.  WILL NOT GO BACK TO OTHER BRUSHES!</li>
    <li> This is a great quality brush. It had held up to washing very well and remains a great stiffness for doing eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Too soft to use for brows.</li>
    <li> After reading rave reviews about this angled brush I decided to buy it to apply eyebrow powder but compared to the one that came with an old kit that fell apart, this does not do a good job. I think the problem is it&#x27;s way too soft. I tried wetting the brush to obtain a defined line and ended up with pale eyeshadow brows!</li>
    <li> Best brow brush if you want precise and natural&lt;br /&gt;Looking!</li>
    <li> This brush is fantastic. I&#x27;ve had it for a year and a half; unfortunately it&#x27;s fallen out of my makeup bag. I bought a different one at Sally&#x27;s while on a road trip. That brush is so stiff it will only work with powder and not gel, which does not suit if you have any bald patches! I need my Makeup Forever Aqua Brow gel! I had to search through my old Amazon orders to track this baby down again. Until I get the nerve to get my brows tattooed. it&#x27;s that gel and THIS BRUSH.</li>
    <li> I find it a little too soft for the purpose of filling in my eyebrows.  It is good for a defined look but it takes quite a while to achieve as the brush is very small.  It works, just not as well as I was hoping...especially for the price.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice brush! Since I have pretty short and thin eyebrows, this little thing helped me to change them completely:)) I love it, and yes I would definitely recommend it....</li>
    <li> Then packaging was very poor (sealed in air tight plastic along a flat piece of cardboard) and caused the tip of the brush to be warped. The overall brush was wonderful, just disappointed in the packaging.</li>
    <li> lo que yo esperaba y me funciona sigma es lo mejor, y llego a tiempo, y escuchado tanto acerca de este producto que supero mis espectativas, viva sigma</li>
    <li> way too think than I thought. almost seems like a small liner pencil. oh well, I guess I will use it for just that. too soft for brows. maybe better for bare areas.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the perfect size to fill in the eyebrows and give them a nice arch. It&#x27;s dense enough too that the product goes on very nicely. I&#x27;m very pleased with this brush. The order came really quick as well so that was nice.</li>
    <li> So much difference between this brush and my previous one!! I can do my eyebrows so perfect! flawless! the shadow application its smooth and look spectacular!</li>
    <li> I got this brush to replace an old one that was fraying at both ends. It works pretty well, the bristles are stuff enough for brow work. I only wish that it was a little more... thicker(?) like my previous one. Still happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I used to have one in another brand but this one is much better. The hair is strong and the brush do the job. I also bought another brush from Sigma after using this one.</li>
    <li> Not happy with the brush I received, the bristles were messed up. It was wrapped in plastic wrap, but only the handle, the brush part wasn&#x27;t protected and half the brush faces a different direction</li>
    <li> Great brush! Very precise!</li>
    <li> Love this brush! Will definitely buy a new one. It makes such thin precise lines. The brush is very soft and dense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for brows!!!</li>
    <li> It was broken when it arrived :( didn&#x27;t have the chance to try it :(</li>
    <li> So perfect!  Quality on point.</li>
    <li> Love this brush for my brows.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not terribly picky, but this is an overall good quality brush.  It serves its purpose.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I swear to god I&#x27;m not being paid by sigma to say any of this.... I loveeeeeeeeeeeee this brush to death,, I use it to conceal under my eyebrows,,,, customer service was amazing,, even got a free gift...... I am already half way from changing all existing brushes In my collection to sigma brushes...... Thank u sooooooo much sigma,,, I love u guys so much...... Buy all sigma brushes, it&#x27;s worth the prices</li>
    <li> Love sigma brushes! Never disappointed! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Best makeup brushes on the market!! Easy to use and don&#x27;t soak up all your product!! I love these brushes and have them in in the performance eyes kit and the mr bunny essential sigma max kit. Worth the money!!!</li>
    <li> great brush, perfect for making sure your brows are &amp;#34;on fleek&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> brush works well with the application of powder onto the eyebrows. fills them in with out looking too fake or bushy.</li>
    <li> I liked this brush it is very easy to use , very soft brush and perfect for the eyebrows , I recommend it</li>
    <li> Just the right size and stiffness.</li>
