      <li>Didnt think it wiuld look good on my skin</li>
      <li>Good coverage.</li>
      <li>I love this powder it blends well and works great for me.</li>
      <li>This covers up all areas I needed most coverage!</li>
      <li>But I dont care for the powder , it smears kind of more than covers.</li>
      <li>I like the power and it stays on but its more of an orange reddish color</li>
      <li>I have seen mortuaries with better makeup.</li>
      <li>I love Maybelline.</li>
      <li>It is more darker than it looks...</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s better if you go the store and buy it in person.</li>
      <li>My favorite make-up -</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>but for now I still love my Maybelline Mineral Powder.</li>
      <li>It is pretty good for its price</li>
      <li>It was worth its price and honestly, it should probably cost more.</li>
      <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>My skin looks great and its not heavy on my skin</li>
      <li>and I loved it because I have really orange skin and could never find a foundation that matched.</li>
      <li>It provides a good, light coverage, has SPF, and blends really well.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>little note: the brush it comes with is not the best.</li>
      <li>I bought a too light coverup and decided to just buy this to fix it.</li>
      <li>and i think its useful to many.</li>
      <li>I will buy again if available when I run out.</li>
      <li>It is light to wear and stays well.</li>
      <li>and it is super cheap.</li>
      <li>The delivery was quick.</li>
      <li>I am glad to finally get my hands on this at such a great price.</li>
      <li>I can use it lightly on my forehead (the tannest part of my face) and still have it blend in very well.</li>
      <li>When I ordered the item, I didn&#x27;t pay much attention too the name of the product and just bought it based on the picture and the cheap price.</li>
      <li>, its worth it.</li>
      <li>I thought i got the right color for me</li>
      <li>i would buy it if it was my color if you have darker skin its good quality but to dark</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t the right shade and u cant see an exact color on the screen so buying the products online like this is iffy.</li>
      <li>I returned to buy this color (honey beige med 4) because I first purchased beige at the store and found that the beige is the same color as I am which is good for the first layer of foundation, but I like a little more color, so I bought this</li>
      <li>When i took the brush out of the package and the first thing i said was, \\&quot;OH MY GOD</li>
      <li>I regretted it that I didn&#x27;t check the reviews first.</li>
      <li>It works pretty well</li>
      <li>came in time, great price, color a little dark for my complexion, but easy to apply</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re smart you&#x27;d just settle for walmart.</li>
      <li>However, I like this makeup because It&#x27;s free of harsh chemicals and talc which is important to me.</li>
      <li>Also, if your face gets very tan over the summer, like mine does, you can use it as a foundation too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>anyone looking to use it as a really mineral foundation, I still recommend it.</li>
      <li>I could use it as a bronzer though, because its really orange-y.</li>
      <li>I really didnt like this product.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t take as much</li>
      <li>Not to mention you&#x27;re stuck with it, and can&#x27;t return it without it costing just as much as you paid to buy it.</li>
      <li>I use it as a bronzer too, because it&#x27;s dark enough, and it has a good undertone (for a bronzer, that is).</li>
      <li>Other than it being way to dark j woukd of been happy with everything.</li>
      <li>I love this powder it works just as well as the more expensive mineral powders.</li>
      <li>I mix it with some light shade loose powder and works well.</li>
      <li>but I advise going lighter than your normal shade</li>
      <li>Other than that it came super fast.</li>
      <li>It goes on way too dark , I barely even use it wish I had knsown someone that could make better use of it .</li>
      <li>but I suggest you do not guess on your foundation colour because they either come to light or to dark.</li>
      <li>I was so surprised when it arrived</li>
      <li>GOOD MAKEUP BUT WRONG COLOR FOR ME.</li>
      <li>The only issue I have is that this particular color was discontinued from the stores.</li>
      <li>On my light/medium colored dry skin, it works really well as a bronzer.&lt;br</li>
      <li>For me, this turned out to be an unexpected treasure, and much cheaper than my other bronzers.</li>
      <li>but apparently i didn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>and it was much darker than I expected.</li>
      <li>I usually like to know expiry dates on everything though but not seeing any, or at least the manufacture date would be good to know as well.</li>
      <li>I thought I had picked it to match my skin tone, but it turned out much too dark!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this powder it works just as well as the more expensive mineral powders.</li>
    <li> I like the power and it stays on but its more of an orange reddish color</li>
    <li> It is more darker than it looks...</li>
    <li> The blush it comes with it is awesome! But I dont care for the powder , it smears kind of more than covers. I will keep it just to have as a spare.</li>
    <li> This shade is too dark for me.</li>
    <li> I use medium for ever other foundation and concealer that I use...this is darker and gives my face an orange coloring. The product isn&#x27;t bad but I advise going lighter than your normal shade</li>
    <li> BUT I GAVE IT TO MY FRIEND  AND BOY ITS A GREAT PATCH FOR HER SO NOW I KNOW WHAT TO GET HER WHEN I HAVE A JUST BECAUSE MOMENT.......</li>
    <li> I have seen mortuaries with better makeup. This was orange and the expiration date had passed when I was sent this product. Needless to say, I will not order makeup online again.</li>
    <li> I am glad to finally get my hands on this at such a great price. I will buy again if available when I run out. The delivery was quick. I love this powder it blends well and works great for me. I have combination skin so my skin never looks oily but never feel dry either. Good coverage. I usually like to know expiry dates on everything though but not seeing any, or at least the manufacture date would be good to know as well. However, I like this makeup because It&#x27;s free of harsh chemicals and talc which is important to me. I will recommend this.</li>
    <li> The color looked super fake and broke me out</li>
    <li> Based on the picture, I thought I would buy the correct color. Wrong! The color is too dark. I regretted it that I didn&#x27;t check the reviews first. Wasting my money.</li>
    <li> It does not spread well or it looks different in the picture way to dark&lt;br /&gt;It does not go on we&#x27;ll worst purchase I made&lt;br /&gt;But good brands!!!!</li>
    <li> Repeat order.  I have used this product for a long time.</li>
    <li> This shade was too dark for me so it isn&#x27;t the product that sucks just I stupidly got the wrong shade! I love Maybelline.</li>
    <li> very red not the shade i should have gotten...with makeup its always a crapshoot, use as eyeshadow</li>
    <li> Maybelline is trying to discontinue my color so I may hate them soon, but for now I still love my Maybelline Mineral Powder. I have to mix them to achieve my caramel color but you&#x27;ve got to do what you&#x27;ve got to do.</li>
    <li> When I ordered the item, I didn&#x27;t pay much attention too the name of the product and just bought it based on the picture and the cheap price. I was so surprised when it arrived and it was much darker than I expected. But, then again, it was all my fault anyways, for not reading the name of the product well. It&#x27;s a very good product with a reddish/orange undertone. I can use it lightly on my forehead (the tannest part of my face) and still have it blend in very well. I use it as a bronzer too, because it&#x27;s dark enough, and it has a good undertone (for a bronzer, that is). For me, this turned out to be an unexpected treasure, and much cheaper than my other bronzers. On my light/medium colored dry skin, it works really well as a bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone looking to use it as a really mineral foundation, I still recommend it. It provides a good, light coverage, has SPF, and blends really well.&lt;br /&gt;For anyone with lighter skin looking to use it as a bronzer, I still recommend it. Also, if your face gets very tan over the summer, like mine does, you can use it as a foundation too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*A little note: the brush it comes with is not the best. It works pretty well but still I prefer to use other brushes over the one they provide.</li>
    <li> I returned to buy this color (honey beige med 4) because I first purchased beige at the store and found that the beige is the same color as I am which is good for the first layer of foundation, but I like a little more color, so I bought this and this color gives that additional rosy glow I was looking for. This will be my regular. I recommend.</li>
    <li> It is light to wear and stays well. I need one shade lighter which was hard to find as this is online purchase. I am plnning to keep it...I mix it with some light shade loose powder and works well.</li>
    <li> I should have keep my money on this one it makes my skin appear orange. The little brush is so not helpful I really didnt like this product.</li>
    <li> this is a way different color than i had imagined.. part of that i blame myself for buying makeup off amazon but i had to try. it was VERY dark. it didnt match my argentinian or phillipino friend&#x27;s skin because it was so dark.</li>
    <li> It goes on way too dark , I barely even use it wish I had knsown someone that could make better use of it . I wish I had done the research prior to purhcasing the product instead of buying it on impulse.</li>
    <li> So they used to sell this product in the store and I loved it because I have really orange skin and could never find a foundation that matched.But then they decied to discontinue the product so now I buy it online im so happy they sell it online,and it is super cheap.My skin looks great and its not heavy on my skin so my pores dont get clogged,perfect for oily skin.I love it</li>
    <li> I only bought this dark shade because I needed to use it as a bronzer. I bought a too light coverup and decided to just buy this to fix it. It worked for me and I loved it!</li>
    <li> i did not like this item it was to dark not good discription i would buy it if it was my color if you have darker skin its good quality but to dark</li>
    <li> GOOD MAKEUP BUT WRONG COLOR FOR ME. TOO ORANGE</li>
    <li> I thought i got the right color for me but apparently i didn&#x27;t. its too dark. I could use it as a bronzer though, because its really orange-y. When i took the brush out of the package and the first thing i said was, \\&quot;OH MY GOD ITS LIKE A FREAKING HORSE BRUSH!!\\&quot; But it was, the brush is really rough, but it applies the product well so i guess its alright. It was worth its price and honestly, it should probably cost more. All in all, you totally need to buy this, its worth it. it makes my pores like invisible.</li>
    <li> I got this yesterday and when I opened it I was a little put off by the packaging. Imagine if you went thru a makeup bin at a flea market it would be something like that. The back was covered in makeup (not from this product I assume from another one similar to this bc it was a similar color) and the paper was bent to hades an back. My makeup was sealed so I know it wasnt the one that was all over the package. it seems to blend well and match my complexion great just wish it didnt look like it came from a flea market</li>
    <li> Didnt think it wiuld look good on my skin but it looks great</li>
    <li> This covers up all areas I needed most coverage! I now only use a bit of concealer and this to finish!</li>
    <li> My favorite make-up - I dont like the feel of liquid makeup so I use the maybelline mineral and you dont feel like you have anything on your face! LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> Box was opened and not right color</li>
    <li> Usually i dont like powder but, i like it and i think its useful to many. I prefer it because of the color.</li>
    <li> muy bueno, entrega rapida y sin problemas. El producto es uno de los mejores que existen! no hay comparación con ninguno</li>
    <li> came in time, great price, color a little dark for my complexion, but easy to apply and I don&#x27;t take as much</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin. The only issue I have is that this particular color was discontinued from the stores. Wonder why???</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t the right shade and u cant see an exact color on the screen so buying the products online like this is iffy. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this at all. Not to mention you&#x27;re stuck with it, and can&#x27;t return it without it costing just as much as you paid to buy it. If you&#x27;re smart you&#x27;d just settle for walmart.</li>
    <li> It was.the wrong color i bought it way to dark.... Other than that it came super fast. Other than it being way to dark j woukd of been happy with everything.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t my color so it&#x27;s better if you go the store and buy it in person. But if it was my color I would probably use it</li>
    <li> I thought I had picked it to match my skin tone, but it turned out much too dark! One should never choose shades from the computer screen for it may deceive.</li>
    <li> It is pretty good for its price but I suggest you do not guess on your foundation colour because they either come to light or to dark. But other than my stupid mistake I like it!</li>
