      <li>;) Spray wisely.</li>
      <li>Okay, let&#x27;s be real here: this smells good.  </li>
      <li>I fell for it when Wal-Mart sold it as a cheap perfume.  </li>
      <li>I bought S.F. Fireworks body spray on a whim and fell absolutely in love with it at first spritz.</li>
      <li>item exactly as described - love the scent.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It comes in a really pretty bottle, with a really pretty \\&quot;cap\\&quot; to replace when not in use... which has come in handy because it&#x27;s been bumped and dropped a couple of times and no accidental discharge or breaking of the pump spritz occurred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Every single time I wear this perfume,I get amazing compliments on it!</li>
      <li>I love this new scent by body fantasies!</li>
      <li>I spray it on my dog&#x27;s bedding, and they smell good all day long...</li>
      <li>this product is really good, really long lasting, smells good, BUT I didn&#x27;t really like it because it smells TOO sweet for</li>
      <li>Still smells nice, I had to order my regular Diamond &amp; Rubies perfume by Elizabeth Taylor.</li>
      <li>but it by far is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just completely worth it.</li>
      <li>It really seems to work with my body chemistry, warming and evolving into a sultry, voluptuous, spicy bouquet that seductively teases me with gentle whiffs as I go about whatever the day brings me, and makes me feel sexy.</li>
      <li>Fireworks only gets better as the day wears on and has never given me that perfume nausea</li>
      <li>DOESN&#x27;T SMELL VERY SWEET?&lt;br /&gt;THANKS.</li>
      <li>Very sensual fragrance.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I have many dusty bottles of various other body sprays that smelled nice in the store and were pleasant at first when I put them on but within an hour or so started to to smell really \\&quot;off\\&quot; and give me a nauseated headache.  </li>
      <li>do not sound appealing to me in general,,,but</li>
      <li>It lasts longer than perfumes I&#x27;ve owned in the past, and it is pretty strong</li>
      <li>but this one has the same lasting power but at a huge fraction of the cost.</li>
      <li>Strong enough to pick up the scent all day long, but not overpowering, at all...</li>
      <li>And it is a pretty big container.</li>
      <li>it smells like pure seduction from victoria&#x27;s secret, with more vanilla and musk.</li>
      <li>Its a yummy combination of wild strawberries, vanilla and peaches.</li>
      <li>absolutely panicked when I went back to the local drug store</li>
      <li>I ordered several bottles of this, directly from manufacturer.</li>
      <li>It is really long lasting and it is one of the few scents I&#x27;ve tried that I could wear and enjoy all day long.</li>
      <li>I broke down and replaced my last bottle from amazon, because I really missed using it in the morning.  </li>

    <li> The product I received was in a pink bottle. Still smells nice, I had to order my regular Diamond &amp; Rubies perfume by Elizabeth Taylor. Wasn&#x27;t satisfied.</li>
    <li> Everytime I wear this I get so many comments on its smell. From men and women.I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in the stores. Its a very lasting smell.</li>
    <li> Great scent, always get complimented when wearing it. Lasts all day and layers well with my perfume.</li>
    <li> Wife loves and has purchased again and again. My daughter now uses also. Very good product and price and wife approved.</li>
    <li> I love this new scent by body fantasies! I receive compliments by men and woman every time I wear it. Its a yummy combination of wild strawberries, vanilla and peaches. If you combine the lotion and the body spray it last all day long. I usually buy name brand perfume but this one has the same lasting power but at a huge fraction of the cost. I spent a total of $12 for the lotion and the body spray. Great deal and a great product!</li>
    <li> Amazing scent, to me it smells like pure seduction from victoria&#x27;s secret, with more vanilla and musk. Smells awesome! My favourite from sexiest fantasies&#x27; line.</li>
    <li> Okay, let&#x27;s be real here: this smells good.  It lasts longer than perfumes I&#x27;ve owned in the past, and it is pretty strong so you don&#x27;t need to use a lot.  It&#x27;s just completely worth it.</li>
    <li> This smell last forever! You can smell it for days! My friend had this stuff and it smelled so good I had to buy it for myself. You will definitely stand out..</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have to go to walmart so I was very happy. I got it for cheaper too and didn&#x27;t have to wait in a long line</li>
    <li> I love this body spray. i bought it a couple years ago and the store stopped selling it. i went online as was able to find it. i know it isnt some expensive bottle of perfume but it by far is my favorite.  Every where i go i usually get at least one comment. Please keep making this and i will keep buying it. I will be a forever happy customer.</li>
    <li> Very sensual fragrance. Perfect for a seductive evening out with your man. ;) Spray wisely. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I fell for it when Wal-Mart sold it as a cheap perfume.  It truly met my needs.  A look at any of the component smells - Strawberry, Vanilla, and Peach do not sound appealing to me in general,,,but a little spritz of the tester sent me home with a bottle.  I broke down and replaced my last bottle from amazon, because I really missed using it in the morning.  I don&#x27;t know if I will continue to buy it, though, since it is now so expensive and not readily available.  It&#x27;s undoubtedly my favorite fragrance.</li>
    <li> item exactly as described - love the scent.  i actually ordered another one for my friend as she loves the scent also.</li>
    <li> I love it smells great.</li>
    <li> this product is really good, really long lasting, smells good, BUT I didn&#x27;t really like it because it smells TOO sweet for me.&lt;br /&gt;CAN ANYONE PLEASE RECOMMEND ME THE BODY SPRAY THAT SMELLS LIKE JADORE?&lt;br /&gt;THAT DOESN&#x27;T SMELL VERY SWEET?&lt;br /&gt;THANKS.</li>
    <li> Smells great, but it is not too strong or overwhelming. I have a mom that gets headaches from most smells, and she does not seem bothered at all. Also, really good price. And it is a pretty big container.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much for the great product I love the smell and had to get the body spray since I have the lotion.  Lots of compliments</li>
    <li> I bought S.F. Fireworks body spray on a whim and fell absolutely in love with it at first spritz. It is really long lasting and it is one of the few scents I&#x27;ve tried that I could wear and enjoy all day long. It really seems to work with my body chemistry, warming and evolving into a sultry, voluptuous, spicy bouquet that seductively teases me with gentle whiffs as I go about whatever the day brings me, and makes me feel sexy. Fireworks is now my \\&quot;signature\\&quot; scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have many dusty bottles of various other body sprays that smelled nice in the store and were pleasant at first when I put them on but within an hour or so started to to smell really \\&quot;off\\&quot; and give me a nauseated headache.  Fireworks only gets better as the day wears on and has never given me that perfume nausea headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely panicked when I went back to the local drug store I bought it from when my bottle was almost empty and they no longer carried any of the S.F. sprays or lotions.  I went to every store I could think of and came up empty.  Thankfully, I found it on the internet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a really pretty bottle, with a really pretty \\&quot;cap\\&quot; to replace when not in use... which has come in handy because it&#x27;s been bumped and dropped a couple of times and no accidental discharge or breaking of the pump spritz occurred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently purchased the body lotion S.F. has in the \\&quot;Fireworks\\&quot; scent and although it IS slightly different, you end up smelling just as delicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dare to be Yummy!</li>
    <li> this went out of stock @ cvs&lt;br /&gt;smells wonderful and holds it smell all day long&lt;br /&gt;comparible to a spitzer of the perfume angel&lt;br /&gt;very nice smell and good for the amount of money&lt;br /&gt;cannot find</li>
    <li> What a wonderful scent! I ordered several bottles of this, directly from manufacturer. It&#x27;s my go-to scent for everything. I spray it on my dog&#x27;s bedding, and they smell good all day long... I use it to freshen my house, my car, my hair... It&#x27;s a wonderful, wonderful product that lasts all day long! Strong enough to pick up the scent all day long, but not overpowering, at all... I get compliments everywhere I go!</li>
    <li> Another spray to add to the collection of sprays i have from sexiest fantasies oh my word does this spray smell like vanilla or what.</li>
    <li> Every single time I wear this perfume,I get amazing compliments on it! Men follow me around just to smell me! This scent is undoubtedly the most amazing scent ever!!</li>
