      <li>so i&#x27;m happy with that!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am happy with my purchase and appreciate the fact that Physicians Formula limits the amount of chemicals in their products.</li>
      <li>but I am happy.</li>
      <li>It contains a great variety of nude/natural eye shadows.</li>
      <li>This is a great set of eye shadows for the no make up looks.</li>
      <li>These are great colors for my green/brown eyes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a drugstore product and the pigmentation is not all that great</li>
      <li>The colors are very nice</li>
      <li>As with most shadows, application is best with a brush applicator.  </li>
      <li>They all have shimmer and feel like good quality.</li>
      <li>I apply them with a variety of makeup brushes to get a good look.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good makeup</li>
      <li>But again, good luck with the lack of pigmentation of this palette.</li>
      <li>Gorgeous colors.</li>
      <li>The colors are gorgeous and they blend well together.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall it was a good experience.</li>
      <li>These weren&#x27;t as good as I thought they would be.</li>
      <li>These have colors that I would not consider to be so neutral for fair skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not even glitter more like speckles!</li>
      <li>Love all of the colors!  </li>
      <li>Very happy daughter, thanks!</li>

      <li>LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>After the first application the shadow matted up and would no longer go on brush...horrible product !!!!</li>
      <li>The nice thing about PF makeup is that it is hypoallergenic.</li>
      <li>The top end of the palette has nice colours and they work well with fair skin and reflect the &amp;#34;Nude&amp;#34; effect that the product advertises.</li>
      <li>Nice choice of neutral colors.</li>
      <li>The eye shadows are also really easy to blend however the brush it comes with cannot be used to blend so using this palette with another brush is a must!</li>
      <li>This is a great set, actually applies very nice</li>
      <li>No irritation and goes on very smoothly.</li>
      <li>I am a very fair skinned person and was trying to buy a makeup pallet that offered some natural colors-</li>
      <li>The colors are so similar it&#x27;s a close perfect match.</li>
      <li>The case is adorable.</li>
      <li>I love the versatility of this palette.</li>
      <li>I love this eye shadow palette.</li>
      <li>Love the colors though.</li>
      <li>Not terrible but not my fave</li>
      <li>Lovely.</li>
      <li>You have to apply many layers for the affect you want.</li>
      <li>Love this eyeshadow.</li>
      <li>I would suggest getting an eyeshadow brush to apply it with to build the colours up better.</li>
      <li>but you can find better products .i</li>
      <li>I like this product for the most part.</li>
      <li>There are many colors to choose from too.</li>
      <li>it is a lot smaller than it looks in the picture but over all good makeup!!</li>
      <li>bag unlike most eyeshadow palettes tend to do.</li>
      <li>and I love it</li>
      <li>That way I would have more of the shadows I want and none of those I don&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>Very soft and beautiful colors.</li>
      <li>thanks a lot i receive this item and its very very nice</li>
      <li>Good quality and pretty colors.</li>
      <li>Love the colors but it doesn&#x27;t go on brush smoothly.</li>
      <li>This shadow palette has nice colors and just the right amount of shimmer.</li>
      <li>very happy there is no glitter unlike the other highlighting eyeshadows</li>
      <li>These are definitely easy on the eye ( to not irritate it)</li>
      <li>Super products!</li>
      <li>Even the case is super cute.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t really too thrilled with the colors.</li>
      <li>it is gluten free.</li>
      <li>Use lightly and it lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t crease or flake off at all.</li>
      <li>Cheap palette.</li>
      <li>The makeup itself lasted throughout most of a day (even whilst it was hot out) and is easy to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Its a very good pallets for beginners, pretty colors that last, and a lot to choose from.</li>
      <li>Colors are pretty light and more of a shimmer than color.</li>
      <li>beautiful when you wet applicator</li>
      <li>it has a nice sent, ok pigments,it could use some more pigment so it shows up a little better but does give a nice natural look.</li>
      <li>The compact size is nice and the presentation of the set is pretty, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend trying to carry it in a handbag as there is no closure for it, it just flips open and closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple of colours toward the bottom that make great liners, but don&#x27;t really fit with the all natural and nude theme, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this product it is so nice and is such a useful pallet</li>
      <li>There is no glitter in the eyeshadows, something that i am very happy about, but they do manage to light up my eyes and make them look bigger or smaller depending on the look you&#x27;re aiming for.</li>
      <li>Not bad</li>
      <li>but i saw it in my mother-in-laws bathroom over the weekend and thought the colors were very pretty.</li>
      <li>But, like I said, they are very pretty.</li>
      <li>I would have been better off buying a few light shades I like and layering them on my own.</li>
      <li>The colors are light, but this is a plus for someone who wants neutral look</li>
      <li>defiantly worth a try</li>
      <li>THey give such a nice smokey eye.</li>
      <li>I have tons of palettes with nude/neutral colors and this one by far is my favorite.</li>
      <li>I use this with Sigma small tapered blending E45, and the combination gives me beautiful results all the time.</li>
      <li>This is a nice pallette, but the color strips are smaller than shown, and lighter.  </li>
      <li>All I can say is wow and more</li>
      <li>Cheap quality; expected more from this brand</li>
      <li>Nice colors but not a high quality eyeshadow.</li>
      <li>the brown and black color on the far end are pretty good but the light colors don&#x27;t work at all.</li>
      <li>The colors are pretty.</li>
      <li>I buy my first product physicians</li>
      <li>Wish there was a different application tool, I use my fingers and it comes out a lot better than the one provided.</li>
      <li>but you can apply wet also, the brush that comes with is just ok but nice for smudging liner and applying to crease, recommend another brush for overall application</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t seem to really deposit any color at all with a brush, and the sponge-tip applicator included only does slightly better.</li>
      <li>I have bought this product previously and love it!</li>
      <li>,that&#x27;s pretty much all i use are neutrals,browns and nudes some charcoal and silver.&lt;br</li>
      <li>They have beautiful colors, they last a decent amount of time, but will this be my HG pallette, or even everyday pallette...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Super products! No watery eyes anymore</li>
    <li> Cheap quality; expected more from this brand</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected, had to push very hard to get pigment onto the brush.</li>
    <li> had high hopes because of the packaging and amazon reviews but I tried this out and was sort of disappointed. the brown and black color on the far end are pretty good but the light colors don&#x27;t work at all. I have really expensive sephora brushes in which I use but idk...not bad but not very good. defiantly worth a try</li>
    <li> thanks a lot i receive this item and its very very nice</li>
    <li> I love this product it is so nice and is such a useful pallet</li>
    <li> The eyeshadow colors are great! However, it was a lot smaller than I expected.</li>
    <li> Very happy daughter, thanks!</li>
    <li> I have bought this product previously and love it! Good quality and pretty colors.</li>
    <li> Very pretty colors, not as dark on my skin as I expected for the price. You have to apply many layers for the affect you want. The strips of shadow are very small though. Probably won&#x27;t last long. But, like I said, they are very pretty.</li>
    <li> nice colors for the price, opacity is a little sheer but you can apply wet also, the brush that comes with is just ok but nice for smudging liner and applying to crease, recommend another brush for overall application but I am happy. Stays almost all day (through my 12 hour work/school schedule)</li>
    <li> Just doesn&#x27;t work well. not strong pigment. Difficult to apply.</li>
    <li> This is a great set, actually applies very nice</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it! I buy my first product physicians formula eand i rate! The pigmentation is too bad.</li>
    <li> Great colors, very poor coverage. Forget about using brushes with this palette, even with the sponge applicator I was still very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I like this color palette.  As with most shadows, application is best with a brush applicator.  Just what I expected and wanted.</li>
    <li> All I can say is wow and more wow! The shadow has a wonderful cream feeling, glides on great and looks beautiful!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t really too thrilled with the colors. They all all glittery. I was looking for more subtle tones without all the sparkle, but if you like sparkle it works fine. One of the kids can use it. The nice thing about PF makeup is that it is hypoallergenic.</li>
    <li> I am so allergic to makeup, but I have had no problems with this eye shadow. I like the variety of shades all in one pack. I&#x27;m not too crazy about the applicator that came with it (sponge tip), but I normally use disposable applicators anyway, so that&#x27;s no problem. I also tried Physician&#x27;s Formula organic mascara, and it is the only mascara I have found that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. I will continue to purchase these products.</li>
    <li> These weren&#x27;t as good as I thought they would be. You have to add a lot of eye shadow to show color quality. The eye shadows run into the other eye shadows of your not careful. There should&#x27;ve been a wall between them like normal eye shadows.</li>
    <li> This is a great set of eye shadows for the no make up looks. Use lightly and it lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t crease or flake off at all. I recommend using a make up brush to apply as then it&#x27;s not a heavy look.</li>
    <li> Wish there was a different application tool, I use my fingers and it comes out a lot better than the one provided. Love the colors though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used physician&#x27;s formula before but i saw it in my mother-in-laws bathroom over the weekend and thought the colors were very pretty. I wrote down the brand and name of the compact then purchased it at my first chance. I&#x27;m very happy that i did! There is no glitter in the eyeshadows, something that i am very happy about, but they do manage to light up my eyes and make them look bigger or smaller depending on the look you&#x27;re aiming for. The color applied dry lasts all day for me but i see that it has faded in the last 7 hours (by now my other eyeshadow would be gone so i&#x27;m happy with that!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the colors are beautiful...very happy there is no glitter unlike the other highlighting eyeshadows i have (so happy!) and the price really isnt too bad. Highly reccomend.</li>
    <li> Nice choice of neutral colors. No irritation and goes on very smoothly.</li>
    <li> I got this product when it was $17 after shipping and all. It&#x27;s a drugstore product and the pigmentation is not all that great so if you can find it at a store I recommend it but not from this seller. I have the naked 2 and the Lorac Unzipped pallet if you&#x27;re going to spend your money on this seller just save. Little and go buy a high end product. Would not recommend you to make a purchase over $12 total.</li>
    <li> Love the colors but it doesn&#x27;t go on brush smoothly. Seems to want to clump and it wastes a lot of it.</li>
    <li> Not bad but you can find better products .i received it partially damaged</li>
    <li> Hoping this brand would have eyeshadow that doesn&#x27;t crease, but not the case</li>
    <li> beautiful when you wet applicator</li>
    <li> Cheap palette. Don&#x27;t waste your $ buying this. Buy the Urban Decay Naked palette.</li>
    <li> I was looking for eyeshadow that are reasonably priced and not harsh. These are definitely easy on the eye ( to not irritate it) The colors are light, but this is a plus for someone who wants neutral look</li>
    <li> Love all of the colors!  A little smaller than I expected but still very nice.</li>
    <li> Colors are pretty light and more of a shimmer than color.</li>
    <li> The colors don&#x27;t show up well. It&#x27;s a mediocre product. Not terrible but not my fave</li>
    <li> Hardly shows up on your eyes and the colors look so lovely in the packaging too I was very disappointed!</li>
    <li> I did not like this at all. I wanted matte eye shadow. This is shimmer. Because of my age I don&#x27;t wear shimmer. Rather than send it back I gave it to my daughter. The colors are pretty.</li>
    <li> I like this eye shadow it has a nice sent, ok pigments,it could use some more pigment so it shows up a little better but does give a nice natural look.</li>
    <li> My young teen daughter has been wanting the Urban Decay Naked eye palette for several months now. I purchased this as an alternative for her. It contains a great variety of nude/natural eye shadows. The case is adorable. I love the black lace and blush ribbon. The lid is magnetic so it stays closed when you want it to. The palette is very small &amp; easy to fit in your purse if you need it to. I had seen it in the stores on several occasions, so I knew what to expect. Maybe when my daughter starts earning her own money, she can purchase the larger Urban Decay palette herself. But until then, this set is perfect for her.</li>
    <li> Beautifull colors but low quality</li>
    <li> I bought this and was intrigued by the nude palette,that&#x27;s pretty much all i use are neutrals,browns and nudes some charcoal and silver.&lt;br /&gt;These shadows are all shimmery glitter but even with urban decay primer and It Cosmetic brushes the eyeshadows were not great and flaked. It&#x27;s not even glitter more like speckles! Horrible pigmentation. The best use is to apply with finger tip.&lt;br /&gt;Another physicians product i am disappointed with. I think i am done with this brand.</li>
    <li> The colors are what I wanted. It lasts a moderate amount in the work day. But it is quite small. Like 4 inches long small.</li>
    <li> These are great colors for my green/brown eyes. There are many colors to choose from too. They all have shimmer and feel like good quality. I bought this BC it is gluten free. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Drugstore dupe for the VERY EXPENSIVE naked 2 palette! The colors are so similar it&#x27;s a close perfect match. Def recommend.</li>
    <li> I am a very fair skinned person and was trying to buy a makeup pallet that offered some natural colors- this does the trick for me! The colors are pale and delicate which looks great on my skin tone, for day time use. I simply add a little water to my brushes to make the colors pop for night time use. I am happy with my purchase and appreciate the fact that Physicians Formula limits the amount of chemicals in their products.</li>
    <li> This was tiny!! I thought it would be larger it&#x27;s about the size of you hand.  My girls like it but it&#x27;s not a big palette it&#x27;s micro.</li>
    <li> This set is very small (I was expecting it to be similar in size to the Naked sets but this is way smaller). The colors are very nice but they&#x27;re all squished together and they&#x27;re different widths. It&#x27;s hard to grab one color at a time. Also slightly too shimmery since all the colors are pretty shimmery. Would be nice to have a mix of a few matte ones in there.</li>
    <li> Very soft and beautiful colors.</li>
    <li> I was expecting much better pigmentation and color from a Physicians Formula product, this was pretty disappointing. I can&#x27;t seem to really deposit any color at all with a brush, and the sponge-tip applicator included only does slightly better. I&#x27;m confused as to why this has such stellar reviews.</li>
    <li> Stays on well&lt;br /&gt;Not much variance in the colors when you actually apply them which is disappointing since it appears to have a nice variety</li>
    <li> Gorgeous colors. They will last all day. I would suggest getting an eyeshadow brush to apply it with to build the colours up better. The applicator included is sub par</li>
    <li> This is a nice pallette, but the color strips are smaller than shown, and lighter.  I would definitely wear a primer with them.  They have beautiful colors, they last a decent amount of time, but will this be my HG pallette, or even everyday pallette...no.  ID use it when I&#x27;m going for that no-makeup look.  Its a very good pallets for beginners, pretty colors that last, and a lot to choose from.</li>
    <li> I love the versatility of this palette. I&#x27;ve only touched the light and middle shades (haven&#x27;t even messed with the darkest trio, cause it&#x27;s a little too dark for what I like), and you can blend them in so many different ways. THey give such a nice smokey eye. I really love it!</li>
    <li> Lovely. Exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> I have tons of palettes with nude/neutral colors and this one by far is my favorite. The colors are very subtle and very natural looking, even the darker colors (the darker colors can also double as soft eyeliners, they work great). You can create tons of different looks with this palette besides what the back of the box suggests. There is shimmer in all the colors, but it&#x27;s very very subtle, not showy or tacky looking, it&#x27;s pretty much perfect, The palette is small too so it won&#x27;t take up a lot of room in your make up bag unlike most eyeshadow palettes tend to do. This is my new favorite item is my make up bag, it has replaced almost all my single eye shadows.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, it&#x27;s only $10 at Wal Mart.</li>
    <li> Smallest, junkiest, and most expensive eyeshadow ever. COMPLETE waste of eighteen dollars.!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap but not even worth it, so don&#x27;t waste your money. If you&#x27;re looking for a good palette to replace the expensive naked palettes, get the \\&quot;revealed\\&quot; palette by coastal scents. Those are way closer to the naked palettes and the colors are very pigmented. What I also didn&#x27;t like about this little palette was the fact that the colors are so close to one another and there is nothing separating them, which makes it hard for you to grab a color without getting it mixed with another one, unless you use a very small brush. But again, good luck with the lack of pigmentation of this palette.</li>
    <li> This shadow palette has nice colors and just the right amount of shimmer. I don&#x27;t like that the colors aren&#x27;t separated, so if you use a brush, its hard to use only one color. I also feel like I have to use more than other brands as the pigment is not as saturated as I would expect. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Nice colors but not a high quality eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> The colors are SO pretty and natural looking.  Best eye shadow I ever bought! Even the case is super cute.</li>
    <li> Love this eyeshadow. The colors are gorgeous and they blend well together. I apply them with a variety of makeup brushes to get a good look. The colrs remind me of the very expensive but wonderful Urban Decay Naked eyeshadow palate.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good makeup and I love it but as soon as I got it the bow fell off and I is very small it is a lot smaller than it looks in the picture but over all good makeup!! A-</li>
    <li> I bought this item thinking that it did not have any shimmer because in the discription it say not say anything about shimmer. Secondly it said to use wet or dry. Using it dry works well. then I tryed using it wet and it just clumps up. Now that its wet it dose not dry out so its always clumpy now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the product, if I could return it used I would.</li>
    <li> I like this product for the most part. The top end of the palette has nice colours and they work well with fair skin and reflect the &amp;#34;Nude&amp;#34; effect that the product advertises. The compact size is nice and the presentation of the set is pretty, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend trying to carry it in a handbag as there is no closure for it, it just flips open and closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple of colours toward the bottom that make great liners, but don&#x27;t really fit with the all natural and nude theme, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The applicator is well made and lasts through a lot of usage, so I can&#x27;t complain there. The product doesn&#x27;t have much scent so that isn&#x27;t an issue, even for people with sensitive skin, this should work. The makeup itself lasted throughout most of a day (even whilst it was hot out) and is easy to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it was a good experience.</li>
    <li> I use this with Sigma small tapered blending E45, and the combination gives me beautiful results all the time. I use this when I do quick fix (an alternative to Naked by UD) and it really does the job. It does not cost too much as well.</li>
    <li> After the first application the shadow matted up and would no longer go on brush...horrible product !!!!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! Colors last long. ....i just love the colors!</li>
    <li> I love this eye shadow palette. There are several nude options as well as more dark options that are all highly pigmented! I use this every single day and have had it a couple of months. The brush it comes with is just a sponge applicator, but it is a high quality sponge material that picks up a decent amount of eye shadow. The eye shadows are also really easy to blend however the brush it comes with cannot be used to blend so using this palette with another brush is a must!</li>
    <li> These have colors that I would not consider to be so neutral for fair skin. I pretty much use only the first lightest shades and have yet to try out the others because they&#x27;re pretty dark and I&#x27;m just not a dark eye shadow kinda gal. I would have been better off buying a few light shades I like and layering them on my own. That way I would have more of the shadows I want and none of those I don&#x27;t. As far as wear is concerned, I don&#x27;t notice it being any better or worse than any drugstore brand.</li>
