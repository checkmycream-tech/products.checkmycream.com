    <li> My teenage daughter uses this as her body moisturizer. She loves it enough that she asked me to buy her another bottle. She loves how super soft her skin feels. It&#x27;s also helped to somewhat control her eczema. My only complaint.....this type of oil NEEDS a spout cap, there&#x27;s no way around it, it&#x27;s going to be messy.</li>
    <li> I combined this product with Castor oil, Jojoba Oil, Tea-tree Oil, Peppermint Oil and Shea butter. I&#x27;ve noticed my hair is much softer and not nearly as brittle. Not sure which product is doing the trick.</li>
    <li> Since I am using this Conditioner, my hair is not longer falling. I just recommend you to use it! Do it!</li>
    <li> The oil came securely.packaged and the bottle was double sealed  Being natural my hair love anything that seals moisture.  I mix and match different oils.</li>
    <li> Excellent hair and skin moisturizer. I am dealing with aging skin fine lines and wrinkle  this product is great and all natural</li>
    <li> Is there a company called Dr. Adorable, Inc. since if there is I cannot find any link to their site on the Net. No link, no phone numbers, no address, ZILCH... Is this oil filtered or unfiltered... Is this oil hexane gassed...Is this 100% oil expeller pressed... Is this oil for internal or external use...Is this oil USDA organic since there is no certification stamp nor USDA stamp...Hopefully Dr. Adorable representative will respond but what kind of company is this without any proper labelling or information...

    <li> Great for any topical use you can think of. Very pure good for you. Best price around by far. Thanks</li>
    <li> Feels great to put on, adsorbs right away. Doesn&#x27;t get rid of psoriasis but is a nice relief in the waiter dryness.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality enjoyed using.  Thicker than regular avocodo oil</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing! I use it on both my hair and my body. Where has avocado oil been all my life?</li>
    <li> I decided to purchase an oil for my body that I have yet to use.. Avocado oil along has been a asset to my body thus far, and I expect more results than I already have received.</li>
    <li> Very light, no strong scent and works well to keep hair moisturized</li>
    <li> very good i have been using it for sometime now and i can say im not dissapointed. very good for you skin.</li>
    <li> nice, simple, clean, pure product. Easy to use and good packaging. Goes on easy on skin. Good brand and value thank you</li>
    <li> I avocado oil to moisturize my skin. And I also use it to make a home made hair conditioner.  It works great.</li>
    <li> I ordered two different oils, the avocado oil and the sweet almond oil ( both apparently pure). I am not an expert but after doing some research I found out that avocado oil should taste slightly nutty while sweet almond oil should have a slight scent. However, I received two identical bottles with different labels (one says avocado, the other sweet almond oil) and that is the only way I can identify them. Both oils have no smell or taste at all....that makes me wonder.&lt;br /&gt;I am not going to order from Dr Adorable inc again simply because I realized that there is no real proof of authenticity and furthermore I dislike that these &#x27;precious&#x27; oils are sent in plastic bottles.</li>
    <li> First off, I love all natural products! I love the Castro oil and the avocado oil. I also receive it in a great package! The size is decent for the price! You get a great amount. I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this avocado oil it is lite and non greasy but very moistening. I love this oil will always use this.</li>
    <li> I really like this product</li>
    <li> I have tried all the expensive anti-aging creams, serums, you name it. Nothing beats the results OR the prices!!! Soaks into the skin. You glow! I&#x27;m 58, lately it&#x27;s been &amp;#34;your skin looks amazing&amp;#34; Organic all the way!!!</li>
    <li> I love to use this oil for my hair as well to retain moisture.</li>
    <li> I love this oil! I&#x27;ll add it to the many Dr. Adorable oils that I have purchased. This company is the best company that I have purchased oils from. They are affordable, they ship the oils to you very fast and the oils are of high quality! I used these oils in my hair regimen and my hair has stopped falling out, that and of course I have made some changes to my diet as well. I don&#x27;t care about the fact that they are in a plastic bottle, that makes them shatter proof! And they have a cap that is easy to pour that way you don&#x27;t spill it and make a mess. Another good reason to purchase these oils is, the fact that every last one of these oils are organic and pure, no chemicals whatsoever! And I do enough damage to my own hair to verify that! I will continue to purchase oils from this company and I hope that they will not change what they are doing!</li>
    <li> The reason I use these type of oils is to put it in little squirt bottles and add my favorite scented oils. apply to my wrists before bed.</li>
    <li> Love it. I keep this bottle in my &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; arsenal for my skin, along with macadamia oil, and castor oil.</li>
    <li> Absorbs well &amp; makes me skin very soft!</li>
    <li> Use it as a non-toxic sunscreen, for face and body...</li>
    <li> Did earlier negative review for this oil and did not look at what oil the review was for since I also  had order black castor oil from a different company, my bad. My avocado oil came earlier than expected and  is great. I will reorder when I run out.</li>
    <li> Ordered from this merchant in the past and returned because of the good quality and reasonable prices. This time, I ordered an avocado oil but received a butter instead. I never contacted the company about it but as soon as they got wind of the mistake, they immediately took steps to correct it without any further inconvenience to me. It was refreshing to be on the receiving end of a courtesy paid by a company that places value on their reputation and their customers... even when the latter unwittingly makes things a little more difficult. Very pleased and will continue to purchase from this merchant.</li>
    <li> I like it.  I don&#x27;t have much to say except I use it in my hair.  I have 4c hair and I uses this as the oil in my l-o-c(liquid, oil, cream) method sometimes.  I don&#x27;t know enough yet to say a big benefit other than it&#x27;s really light and I like that.</li>
    <li> I had brought this oil along time ago and it was a very good oil. I have since brought avocado oil from somewhere else but this oil was just fine. I mixed it with other oils for my hot oil treatments and I also mixed it with a conditioner for a pre poo method before shampooing my hair. The oil has a slight scent and it is light oil.</li>
