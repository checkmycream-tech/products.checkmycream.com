      <li>the bowl should really be ceramic but for the price good deal</li>
      <li>Good brush, real hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheaply made...</li>
      <li>Better than I was expecting for the price, The razor is crappy but the other pieces like the brush are great</li>
      <li>Nice set up brush and soap dish are good razor is cheap and not worth using.</li>
      <li>The only good thing to say about the razor is it will work fine if you have nothing else.</li>
      <li>Neither of those were true.</li>
      <li>My boyfriend loved it, besides it only being a two blade razor.</li>
      <li>not a bad item for its price.</li>
      <li>Cheap everything broke right when I got it in the mail.</li>

      <li>The razor is just right for him.</li>
      <li>Soap disk, brush, and holder work great - takes up very little surface space on the bathroom counter.  </li>
      <li>Simply saying I liked it is enough for most of what I buy.</li>
      <li>Was skeptic at first to purchase this item, but I did because of the price.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly what it says it is.</li>
      <li>You would be better off going to a beauty supply store if you are looking for a traditional safety razor and razor blades for a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>The only thing i liked about this set was the stand and the bowl, both the brush and the razor are cheaply made and are rough on the skin.</li>
      <li>I tossed the brush that came with it into my tool bag where it is good for sweeping away the dust from small objects.</li>
      <li>The ring which holds the razor is a small diameter, to fit this razor, and would not be able to accept most other razors.</li>
      <li>This is a very practical shaving apparatus.</li>
      <li>can  fit a double edge blade with it...</li>
      <li>I was looking for something that contains a shaving brush and bowl that I can use to lather my shaving cream but at a reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>My husband really likes this.</li>
      <li>the bowl fits my williams shave soap in it very well.</li>
      <li>i didnt expect it from a stainless steel unit.</li>
      <li>But it gets all my shaving stuff together and ready to go.</li>
      <li>, Thanks...</li>
      <li>Thanks, Thanks, Thanks, Thanks, Thanks</li>
      <li>Thanks, Thanks, Thanks, Thanks, Thanks, Thanks...</li>
      <li>Its okay the razer could have been a better quality.the razer was broken when i recieved my package.</li>
      <li>Thanks, Thanks, Thanks, Thanks, Thanks, Thanks...</li>
      <li>It did take a very long time, couple of weeks to arrive but other than that very nice.</li>
      <li>In 2014 we are very busy and to require a large statement (as you do) in these reviews.</li>
      <li>Bowl is perfect size for my round bars of shaving soap and the brush is stiff yet soft on my skin when applying the lather</li>
      <li>I did not even try the razor because I do not like twin-blade razors, much less one that I will never be able to find replacement blades for.</li>
      <li>so i use this as my main.</li>
      <li>Was a gift for my husband who has a very sensitive face.</li>
      <li>Cheaply made bristle&#x27;s fall from handle after just a few uses.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping -big plus on that.</li>
      <li>Overall it is a decent purchase for the money.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m currently using but nothing else will fit in that small hole.</li>
      <li>it is pretty good, but the brush is almost worthless.</li>
      <li>I wish the brush sat a little higher off the bowl though.</li>
      <li>He said the stand is so lightweight it barely stands up; the razor is very basic (like a Bic disposable); and the overall quality is inferior.</li>

    <li> When I received my product the razor was broke the stand was broken. Not satisfied!!!</li>
    <li> Soap disk, brush, and holder work great - takes up very little surface space on the bathroom counter.  The only good thing to say about the razor is it will work fine if you have nothing else.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that contains a shaving brush and bowl that I can use to lather my shaving cream but at a reasonable price.  This product met my needs.  I would not use the razor on a dare! It might be hard to find replacement blades anyway if you were to try to use them and run out.  Overall it is a decent purchase for the money.  You would be better off going to a beauty supply store if you are looking for a traditional safety razor and razor blades for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> A great product to my vintage collection</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this. It did take a very long time, couple of weeks to arrive but other than that very nice. Also it doesnt take up a lot of space which is nice.</li>
    <li> The brush is great but the razor wasn&#x27;t very smooth.</li>
    <li> I just wanted a new stand for my good boar&#x27;s hair brush and thought the drip bowl was a good add so I bought this item. I tossed the brush that came with it into my tool bag where it is good for sweeping away the dust from small objects. The worst part of the assemblage is the razor; it was dull enough to rip the skin off my face and I tossed the blades after one try. I would have liked to use the holder for the razor I&#x27;m currently using but nothing else will fit in that small hole.</li>
    <li> Bought it for the rack &amp; cup liking it a lot. Had my own razor &amp; brush . Works good.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed this item I purchased. In 2014 we are very busy and to require a large statement (as you do) in these reviews. Simply saying I liked it is enough for most of what I buy. To elaborate with a required number of words is both time consuming, and cumbersome. Please reconsider and adjust this part of your feedback requirements so more of us could participate. Thanks, Thanks, Thanks, Thanks, Thanks, Thanks...this is silly stop requiring so many words as a requirement ; Thanks, Thanks, Thanks, Thanks, Thanks, Thanks...this is silly stop requiring so many words as a requirement ; Thanks, Thanks, Thanks, Thanks, Thanks, Thanks...this is silly stop requiring so many words as a requirement ;</li>
    <li> We ordered it and it took weeks before it arrived. Then when it did the razor was broken and some of the extra blades were rusted. So we threw away everything except the bowl.  The brush is a little rough...would not buy it again</li>
    <li> It would have been great had they designed this to hold larger razors. I did not even try the razor because I do not like twin-blade razors, much less one that I will never be able to find replacement blades for. To my best knowledge, there are no other cartridges that will fit this razor. I gave the razor to my Father-In-Law. He likes twin blades.&lt;br /&gt;The brush was a pleasant surprise! I thought it would stink and poke my face. Neither of those were true. The brush is softer than the Tweezerman shaving brush I had purchased a couple of days before this one. The bowl works, but could be a little larger. This would be a great value at around $8 bucks.</li>
    <li> The razor that came with it is not very good quality - everything else is &amp;#34;all good&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I had no use for the razor but I like the stand, brush and bowl. I wish the brush sat a little higher off the bowl though. Bowl is perfect size for my round bars of shaving soap and the brush is stiff yet soft on my skin when applying the lather</li>
    <li> Razor was broken and extremely cheap. The brush is also loosing hair and is rough. It&#x27;s a nice stand an bowl. That&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> the bowl should really be ceramic but for the price good deal</li>
    <li> Nice set up brush and soap dish are good razor is cheap and not worth using. Replaced razor with mach 3</li>
    <li> The item is just what I wanted. Perfect!!!!!!!!!!  No worries!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> When we received this item it was broken in three different places.</li>
    <li> The brush is OK. I would get a better quality one. the holder for the razor stick could use a redesign since it doesnt allow any other razor sticks to be hosted in the tiny hole. I noticed that if i dont keep the unit in a dry place, I do see some rust staining on the steel frame that is staining my marble sink. i didnt expect it from a stainless steel unit. I would have given it a 3 stars if I didnt have the rust staining issue.</li>
    <li> it is pretty good, but the brush is almost worthless. I bought it mostly for the cup and stand.</li>
    <li> Better than I was expecting for the price, The razor is crappy but the other pieces like the brush are great</li>
    <li> It works, the razor is a toss away. I would never shave with it. But it gets all my shaving stuff together and ready to go.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loved it, besides it only being a two blade razor. Good brush, real hair. Fast shipping -big plus on that. Also good communication with the seller.</li>
    <li> This is a very practical shaving apparatus. And I use it every day!</li>
    <li> I just got this I haven&#x27;t had a chance to review it.  It&#x27;s exactly what it says it is.</li>
    <li> This was a giftI sent to my son. He is very disappointed with it. He said the stand is so lightweight it barely stands up; the razor is very basic (like a Bic disposable); and the overall quality is inferior. Would not recommend or ever order again.</li>
    <li> The quality of this item does not need any stars! It was shipped with rusty razors and was very poor quality. Do not order!</li>
    <li> can  fit a double edge blade with it...</li>
    <li> Good value, as others I have priced cost much more.  My problem is that the razor has no brand name, nor do the blade refills. I do not know where to obtain refills for this razor. The ring which holds the razor is a small diameter, to fit this razor, and would not be able to accept most other razors.</li>
    <li> not a bad item for its price. mine came in just as showed in the picture. the box it arrived in however was crushed in on one side. no damage to the item though. the brush is taking some time to break in. i have a van der hagen brush that i do not use due to the fact that it is shedding the hairs so i use this as my main. only downfall to this brush is that i have tried every way possible to &amp;#34;condition&amp;#34; the smell out. it is a stubborn brush but smells a ton better than when i got it. the bowl fits my williams shave soap in it very well. i have my own safety razor that i use so i leave the provided one in its holder just for looks. i did shave with it once with possitive results. overall this is a handy item to have and well worth the price.</li>
    <li> The only thing i liked about this set was the stand and the bowl, both the brush and the razor are cheaply made and are rough on the skin.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made bristle&#x27;s fall from handle after just a few uses.</li>
    <li> Great.  Son in law loves it.</li>
    <li> Its okay the razer could have been a better quality.the razer was broken when i recieved my package.</li>
    <li> I received this broken.  It&#x27;s cheaply made...you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Cheap everything broke right when I got it in the mail.</li>
    <li> Was skeptic at first to purchase this item, but I did because of the price. Was a gift for my husband who has a very sensitive face. The razor is just right for him. He loves it.</li>
