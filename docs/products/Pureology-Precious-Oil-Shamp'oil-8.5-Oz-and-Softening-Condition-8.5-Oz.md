      <li>I was thrilled when I saw this available on amazon.</li>
      <li>I was out of product and did not have time to get to the hair dresser to purchase more.</li>
      <li>and I do hope this is Precious Oil</li>
      <li>I love pureology prodcuts -</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>Love the smell though.</li>
      <li>but I cannot be sure.</li>
      <li>and I couldn&#x27;t help but notice it had made my hair more manageable.  </li>
      <li>the precious oils blend cause</li>
      <li>Precious Oil Conditioner is creamy and feels like its working while I&#x27;m applying it, and that&#x27;s important to me.</li>
      <li>It seems like it was filled with inferior product.</li>
      <li>Pureology is sulfate free.</li>
      <li>So worth it!</li>
      <li>The shampoo is not bad, however, I prefer the Pureology Pure Volume shampoo for my fine hair because I believe it lathers better.</li>
      <li>Great for dry and color treated hair.</li>
      <li>Which is a good thing because it makes the product last so much longer :)</li>
      <li>Love the oil in this shampoo and it really helped after  </li>
      <li>sure why this costs so much.  </li>
      <li>Even my very unobservant boyfriend noticed and kept touching my hair that day because he said it was so soft.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This does not smell like the Precious Oil I&#x27;ve been buying locally from a reputable salon</li>
      <li>I saw a difference the very first time I used it.  </li>
      <li>I love, love, love Pureology and I definitely recommend the conditioner (I think it would work well on many hair types as long as you rinse thoroughly).</li>
      <li>It really keeps it from frizzing and becoming unruly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always liked Pureology, but I&#x27;ve never had my hair react to a product so instantly like this before.  </li>
      <li>i do not think this is worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have naturally curley, fine hair.</li>
      <li>Hard to find and works great on my hair.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>My hair is so much softer and manageable now!</li>
      <li>They aren&#x27;t too heavy &amp; smell really good.</li>
      <li>I find myself using a large amount of both the shampoo and conditioner and in the end</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried both Pureology&#x27;s Pure Volume and Hydrate conditioners.</li>
      <li>have fine combination hair (gets oily at the roots, but is pretty dry everywhere else).  </li>
      <li>If you want the real thing, buy it from a salon.</li>
      <li>But I really don&#x27;t find it offensive at all.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really stick around in my hair, but maybe that&#x27;s just me.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is very moisturizing without making the hair oily.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m really impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it really helped with the shine and texture.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t color my hair, but I just like it because it seems to be more gentle than other brands.  </li>
      <li>Im sure it would work great on my long curly colour treated hair, but Ill never know unless they make it smell decent!</li>
      <li>I love other pureology products, just not this one.</li>
      <li>I purchased both the shampoo and conditioner trial sizes right after I got my fine, blonde hair highlighted (which I do regularly).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s slightly musky which is why I don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
      <li>I tried this particular shampoo and conditioner when I stayed over at a friends</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I am older and a little more frugal now.</li>
      <li>The precious oil shampoo may have been a tad too heavy for my hair, but it may work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I feel the shampoo is thinner than normal.  </li>
      <li>Leaves it soft and silky.</li>
      <li>My hair is incredibly soft after I use this.</li>
      <li>I have old hair, I&#x27;m 63</li>
      <li>the shampoo feels like warm honey and is hard to spread and work through my long hair.</li>
      <li>Make sure your hair is very wet before shampooing, and you&#x27;ll also have to put a little work into the lathering.</li>
      <li>My hair was feeling very dry and frizzy and this has helped so much.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m terribly upset over this, because I love pureology nano works and hydrate lines, so I was super excited for this line when it came out.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 months and based on the other reviews on Amazon and reviews elsewhere, I really wanted to like it.  </li>

<li> Ulta or any other salon.</li>
<li> Just because its natural doesnt mean it needs to stink!</li>

<li> If it smells bad or makes your hair dry, you are probably either not using it correctly, or you are not getting a real Pureology product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The smell of the shampoo gave me a headache.  Couldn&#x27;t wait to wash my hair with something else.  I love other pureology products, just not this one.</li>
    <li> Great for dry and color treated hair.</li>
    <li> After just a few washes my hair feels softer and looks healthier.</li>
    <li> Made my hair very dry</li>
    <li> These products are awesome. They aren&#x27;t too heavy &amp; smell really good. The price is really good also. Pureology, @ the store is way way more money. These 2 products together were about half what you would pay @ Ulta or any other salon.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner is AMAZING. I have used Pureology in the past when I used to color my hair often. I am older and a little more frugal now. I haven&#x27;t lightened my hair in forever and I decided to do so recently. It was dry and brittle and unmanageable. It looked horrible. I finally decided to suck it up and spend the $$ to buy Pureology. My hair is so much softer and manageable now! For a while I was regretting lightening my hair but not anymore. It also smells amazing! A few words of advice: Pureology is sulfate free. This means it does not lather like a regular shampoo. Sulfate is what makes the lather in shampoo and soap, but it also causes cancer. Make sure your hair is very wet before shampooing, and you&#x27;ll also have to put a little work into the lathering. It doesn&#x27;t do it on it&#x27;s own like sulfate containing products. Also, Pureology products are only guaranteed when purchased at a salon. I see a lot of negative reviews, and the fact is that you are probably not receiving real Pureology products. Pureology sells for about $29 each at salons, that about a $60 tag. If something seems too good to be true, sometimes it probably is. I remember learning this the hard way when I bought a name brand moisturizer I used at a discount store, only to break out in horrible acne. If you want the real thing, buy it from a salon. There are some things that just can&#x27;t be purchased at a discount. If it smells bad or makes your hair dry, you are probably either not using it correctly, or you are not getting a real Pureology product.</li>
    <li> This was the best Pureology product that I have ordered so far.  I saw a difference the very first time I used it.  I have old hair, I&#x27;m 63 and it really helped with the shine and texture.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My gf is very happy with the product.  I am very happy with the price and convenience of the purchase.  So, very happy.</li>
    <li> I love pureology prodcuts - so I decided to try the precious oils blend cause I liked the smell - but I did not like it.  Didn&#x27;t lather and my hair felt greasey/oily - I used it up (made my husband use it ha) but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have bought this product at the hair salon and it is the only shampoo/conditioner system that works for my wavy/curly mix of hair. I was out of product and did not have time to get to the hair dresser to purchase more. I was thrilled when I saw this available on amazon. BEWARE! this is NOT Pureology. At first I thought I might be wrong, but after several times washing my hair I knew that this was a fake. My hair was a mess. The smell is totally different. The texture as well. It seems like it was filled with inferior product. I even brought it to my hairdresser and she agreed with me.</li>
    <li> Expensive for only 8 ounces.</li>
    <li> This set of shampoo and conditioner are the best I have used yet. I have used it since it arrived on the market. I have naturally curley, fine hair. It really keeps it from frizzing and becoming unruly. It also does not get dry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 months and based on the other reviews on Amazon and reviews elsewhere, I really wanted to like it.  I was away from home and used another shampoo and conditioner for 5 days and was amazed at how great my hair looked and felt.  When I returned home, I used that same shampoo with the same results.  Then I tried the pureology again.  My hair was frizzy and dry.  Guess I&#x27;ll use it to shave my legs - but it&#x27;s really expensive shaving cream!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure why this costs so much.  It smells horrible too.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. You really only need to use a very small amount as it can make your hair look oily if your not careful. Which is a good thing because it makes the product last so much longer :)</li>
    <li> heavy shampoo and conditioner that works well for my dyed and highlighted hair. Good shine, weight and helps frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con- the shampoo feels like warm honey and is hard to spread and work through my long hair. I find myself using a large amount of both the shampoo and conditioner and in the end i do not think this is worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;winning combo for my red and blonde, over processed hair is Herbal Essences hello hydration shampoo with Pureology Revitalizing red conditioner.</li>
    <li> The smell of the shampoo and condition is not good. I have used Ojon in the past and it has a much different small. My stylist recommended this one for its hydrating properties.</li>
    <li> Great Product. Love it.</li>
    <li> LOve it! It&#x27;s great for my hair!!</li>
    <li> This does not smell like the Precious Oil I&#x27;ve been buying locally from a reputable salon and I do hope this is Precious Oil but I cannot be sure.</li>
    <li> I feel the shampoo is thinner than normal.  Not as moisturizing as I remember.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. I have long hair and I use bleach to make in blonde so it needs a good conditioner. My hair is incredibly soft after I use this.</li>
    <li> I keep thinking oils in products should be moisturizing however this line was not at all!  I had to return it.</li>
    <li> It may work for some people, but I have Keratin in my hair and when I wash it it feels dry and tangled. Love the smell though. It stays for 2 washes, so I alternate my shampoos and use this one just once a month. Will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Pureology, but I&#x27;ve never had my hair react to a product so instantly like this before.  I don&#x27;t color my hair, but I just like it because it seems to be more gentle than other brands.  I tried this particular shampoo and conditioner when I stayed over at a friends and I couldn&#x27;t help but notice it had made my hair more manageable.  Even my very unobservant boyfriend noticed and kept touching my hair that day because he said it was so soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine combination hair (gets oily at the roots, but is pretty dry everywhere else).  I had difficulty find a conditioner that can give me the moisture I need without completely weighing down my hair flat and limp, but no longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got back home, I did a search online to purchase this shampoo and conditioner, but I couldn&#x27;t remember the exact line and when I saw the Amazon reviews complaining about the fragrance, I was afraid this was the wrong one.  But I ordered it anyway and it&#x27;s definitely this one!  Although I don&#x27;t like the scent, I don&#x27;t mind it either.  It&#x27;s slightly musky which is why I don&#x27;t love it.  But I really don&#x27;t find it offensive at all.  It doesn&#x27;t really stick around in my hair, but maybe that&#x27;s just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s hair is different, but this works for me and I hope they NEVER discontinue it!</li>
    <li> I purchased both the shampoo and conditioner trial sizes right after I got my fine, blonde hair highlighted (which I do regularly). The shampoo is not bad, however, I prefer the Pureology Pure Volume shampoo for my fine hair because I believe it lathers better. The precious oil shampoo may have been a tad too heavy for my hair, but it may work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, the conditioner is perfect. I&#x27;ve tried both Pureology&#x27;s Pure Volume and Hydrate conditioners. I&#x27;ve been using the Hyrdate for a while now and love it. I thought I&#x27;d switch just to give my hair something different and I&#x27;m really impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Precious Oil Conditioner is creamy and feels like its working while I&#x27;m applying it, and that&#x27;s important to me. I even put a little on my scalp and as long as I rinse well, my hair is not greasy. My hair feels softer and looks shinier. I love, love, love Pureology and I definitely recommend the conditioner (I think it would work well on many hair types as long as you rinse thoroughly). So worth it!</li>
    <li> I love the smell and feel of this shampoo and conditioner.  My hair was feeling very dry and frizzy and this has helped so much. This has helped in the summer humidity too.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great for colored, drier hair....smells great, hair is soft.  Concentrated so you don&#x27;t need alot, and it will last longer.</li>
    <li> Hard to find and works great on my hair. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Love the oil in this shampoo and it really helped after  I had gone thru chemo and radiation.  It is very moisturizing without making the hair oily.  My hair now feels like silk.</li>
    <li> This product smells awful! I cant even give it a proper review because I could&#x27;nt stand to use it in my hair after just sniffing the bottles! I&#x27;m terribly upset over this, because I love pureology nano works and hydrate lines, so I was super excited for this line when it came out. Im sure it would work great on my long curly colour treated hair, but Ill never know unless they make it smell decent! Just because its natural doesnt mean it needs to stink! Bummer!</li>
    <li> Great product for your hair. Leaves it soft and silky.</li>
