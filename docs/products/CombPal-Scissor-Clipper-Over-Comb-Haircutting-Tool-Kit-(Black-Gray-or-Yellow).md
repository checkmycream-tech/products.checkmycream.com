      <li>We were delighted to find this and it WORKS!  </li>
      <li>But in meantime, I&#x27;m going to try it out on my dogs hair, as I think it will work great there, since I scissor cut them.</li>
      <li>but it looks nice and all of the parts fit perfectly when exchanged.</li>
      <li>and I LOVE it!  </li>

<li> This is a good concept &amp; product if a person has some knowledge about hair cutting.</li>
<li> Turns out that my hair is really long enough to use it as often as I would thinking but for now it appears to work well if your hair is long</li>
<li> The combpal is so easy to use and makes my haircutting less haphazard!</li>
<li> Just a little awkard for now.</li>
<li> The comb hair cutting devise works very well ..</li>
<li> big, cumbersome, expensive, not worth the money.</li>
<li> Not sure if it was intended for that.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been cutting husband&#x27;s hair for several years, but the same cutting tools do not work on longer hair.  </li>
<li> I have very thick hair</li>
<li> Not easy to use and change size cutting guides.  </li>
<li> Arthritis in my shoulder makes it difficult to reach all parts of my head.</li>
<li> and it becomes uncomfortable, in the way, and ugly when it gets too overgrown.</li>
<li> Too pricey :(</li>

    <li> I have not used it yet but it looks nice and all of the parts fit perfectly when exchanged.</li>
    <li> I bought this to cut my own hair. Not sure if it was intended for that.  When I had both arms in the air, could not see back of head, so wasn&#x27;t so good there, but it worked for hair I could see.  Think I just need practice. But in meantime, I&#x27;m going to try it out on my dogs hair, as I think it will work great there, since I scissor cut them.It&#x27;s a pretty neat product.</li>

    <li> I really needed this to help me cut my son&#x27;s hair. This comb is so simple and easy to use! Shipped fast as well. Will be saving a lot of money with this comb!</li>

    <li> Too pricey :( not woth for 30$</li>
    <li> Takes the guess work out of at home haircuts. I cut my own pixie style hair as well as my dads. He prefers the combpal cut over a clipper cut now. Good product!</li>
    <li> Turns out that my hair is really long enough to use it as often as I would thinking but for now it appears to work well if your hair is long</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to keep hair looking neat between visits to the beauty salon.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work so well when trying to cut your own hair.</li>
    <li> Not as easy as shown in the video.  It will take some practice to get used to them, but I think when I do I will like them.  Just a little awkard for now.</li>
    <li> I am a hairdresser and like to cut my own hair. The combpal is so easy to use and makes my haircutting less haphazard! My husband can even use it!</li>
