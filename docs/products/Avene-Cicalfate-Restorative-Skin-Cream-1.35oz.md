      <li>(after it was safe to do so) twice a day</li>
      <li>Great product, fast shipping..</li>
      <li>More than satisfied</li>
      <li>and it works magic</li>
      <li>I love using this cream all over my face at night before bed time.</li>
      <li>I bought this after reading reviews and it meets ALL my expectations and more.  </li>
      <li>i bought many of the avene products...</li>
      <li>As this doctor calls it &amp;#34; miracle cream&amp;#34; which is very true.</li>
      <li>It seemed to make a difference within just 1 day, with the itchiness disappearing, and the redness becoming lighter.  </li>
      <li>I had ordered a full tube on Amazon (a Prime product, so I had it in two days!), and will use this cream every night.</li>
      <li>I &#x27;m not a person who can easily find a skin prodcut I like , however this is greart .</li>
      <li>I is easy to travel with, too.</li>
      <li>The scars are fading very quickly.  </li>
      <li>and I can easily apply makeup over it without loss of coverage.  </li>
      <li>A sensative skin, brilliant for any skin iritations on the face like dry patches, sensative areas.</li>
      <li>Over the 3 years I have used it, I gave gone from gravel face to baby bottom blemish free</li>
      <li>I tried it and have been faithfully applying it twice daily with great results.  </li>
      <li>I love this restorative cream, but is what very runny and more water came out than cream.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Great cream for dry skin.</li>
      <li>Low temperature will seperate it into water and cream.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway this is perfect item if u have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Had major facial electrolysis and this cream was wonderful.</li>
      <li>I really think this helps my skin restore and vitalize :)</li>
      <li>The tube was full of water.</li>
      <li>Love that it is not greasy and feels soft and smooth, almost like water.  </li>
      <li>She said on the contrary, it would heal the spots I had and would not cause more, and restore my skin...make it calm, soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>It calms down skin if there is redness and also great after a glycolic peel.</li>
      <li>Really good moisturising cream I originally bought it after I had some dark spots lasered from my face and was advised to use this to help with the healing process.</li>
      <li>a famous dermatologist speak and recommend this product as a face cream to restore natural ph.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey but well worth the money.</li>
      <li>Though I have sensitive skin, I&#x27;m able to tolerate wrinkle-fighting retinol products (I use Roc), but had stopped using it after the cleanser burn.</li>
      <li>I had to drain out the water and place cream in another container to get the right consistancy.  </li>
      <li>and it actually leaves a beautiful matte, velvety finish, but it feels like the next day</li>
      <li>It feels clean and is very softening on the skin.</li>
      <li>sure enough it was full of water.  </li>
      <li>This product did not arrive quickly and was very watery and not creamy as it should be.</li>
      <li>I like this product very much.</li>
      <li>I opened it and all this liquid poured out and then upon squeezing there was a more solid &amp;#34;lotion.&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>Subsequently, I read more about this product I decided to buy that.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll try again with another seller as I love this cream and it does work especially after I do peels.</li>
      <li>This cream protects and is great for extremely delicate skin.</li>
      <li>A lot of water came out first.</li>
      <li>A ton of water came out when I first opened it, and it continues to happen.</li>
      <li>All key ingredients to healthy skin.  </li>
      <li>While the product seems a bit greasy at first, I have found that it does not cause my skin to break out</li>
      <li>She recommended the Avene Cicalfate cream and gave me a large sample - she said this is what plastic surgeons give their patients to heal their skin after laser resurfacing and chemical peels.</li>
      <li>I have used this cream and it certainly has helped in the recovery of my face skin.  </li>
      <li>expected better &amp;#34;restoration&amp;#34; of skin.</li>
      <li>If my skin is really irritated, I wear it at home 24/7 like a mask.</li>
      <li>Thanks God.</li>
      <li>Their thermal water spray is also very soothing.</li>
      <li>I was hoping that it would help with an irritation under my glasses, but it didn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
      <li>It is really helping to repair my skin.</li>
      <li>still gentle though</li>
      <li>friend&#x27;s sister is an aesthetician, she saw me and confirmed that I had something similar to a chemical burn.</li>
      <li>It must be run out fast.</li>
      <li>and it really helps with my ski healing.</li>
      <li>The real cream was still inside.</li>
      <li>it is very watery.</li>
      <li>Just using this at night effectively reduces need for heavy lotions during the day.</li>
      <li>So far I was always very lucky with European products.</li>
      <li>I usually use aqua glycolic face cream, which is amazing too.</li>
      <li>it will instantly soothe and cool your skin</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product</li>
      <li>Hence the reason I had purchased a new anti-aging, &amp;#34;plant stem cell&amp;#34; cleanser.</li>
      <li>It must be pretty mild if it can be used on little pets with no skin irritation.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product was so watery i couldn&#x27;t use it as a cream, it was more like a very thin messy lotion, very expensive unusable product, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Really good moisturising cream I originally bought it after I had some dark spots lasered from my face and was advised to use this to help with the healing process. The cream is so thick and rich i decided to carry on using it several times a week to keep my face hydrated. I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> I cannot recommend this enough! It has healed my skin like nothing else. I have very sensitive, breakout-prone, combination skin. Add to that, I&#x27;m 47, so I also have fine lines and loss of firmness that I&#x27;m trying to combat! Hence the reason I had purchased a new anti-aging, &amp;#34;plant stem cell&amp;#34; cleanser. Used it one time, my skin was blotchy and irritated. I tried it again the next day, and it actually looked and felt burned. I ditched it of course, but the damage was done - it had totally stripped my skin, so a dry layer was forming, and then I started breaking out horribly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend&#x27;s sister is an aesthetician, she saw me and confirmed that I had something similar to a chemical burn. She recommended the Avene Cicalfate cream and gave me a large sample - she said this is what plastic surgeons give their patients to heal their skin after laser resurfacing and chemical peels. This cream is thick and creamy, so I worried it would break me out more. She said on the contrary, it would heal the spots I had and would not cause more, and restore my skin...make it calm, soft and smooth. She gave me a gentle soy-based gel cleanser (by Fresh) and told me to use a thin layer of the Avene Cicalfate cream in the morning and at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed at how much better my skin looked and felt after just one night! The blemishes were flat and less red, the blotchiness was gone, and my skin felt so soft and good. After three days, my skin is even and glowing, the original spots are almost completely gone, and I have just one new small pimple on my chin today. I had ordered a full tube on Amazon (a Prime product, so I had it in two days!), and will use this cream every night. Though I have sensitive skin, I&#x27;m able to tolerate wrinkle-fighting retinol products (I use Roc), but had stopped using it after the cleanser burn. I am going to start using it again tonight, under the Cicalfate cream, and see how it goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this cream - it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> I will never be without this product again results are instant and dramatic!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have told everyone I thought would benefit from this creme to buy it immediately!!!</li>
    <li> not worth the money, just a basic rich cream. i saw no effect on my face so just ended up using it as a hand cream.</li>
    <li> This product is a must have for my wife.  I use it for razor burn as well.  It contains copper, magnesium and zinc.  All key ingredients to healthy skin.  It heals skin much fast than simple lotions from Walgreens, CVS, etc.</li>
    <li> It is really helping to repair my skin. I did find it annoying that water pours out of it, but it still works great.</li>
    <li> Soothes and softens angry skin.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s laser treatments for psoriasis have caused occasional blistering and this product is amazing--it heals the blistered spots very quickly, especially when it&#x27;s used in conjunction with the Avene Akerat Smoothing Exfoliating Cream.</li>
    <li> This is a little heavy for my combination skin.  I was hoping that it would help with an irritation under my glasses, but it didn&#x27;t do much.  When I use a make-up wipe, I apply just a thin amount and it actually leaves a beautiful matte, velvety finish, but it feels like the next day or so my pores are clogged.  I still use it on dry patches, but it is too heavy for everyday use</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion  20 days ago, because after my surgery, I have suffered a scar on my face. Subsequently, I read more about this product I decided to buy that. But unluckily I didn&#x27;t see any improvement in my scar: -(</li>
    <li> Squeezed the bottle and tons of water came out. Not sure what happened but I&#x27;ve used this product before so I know what it is supposed to look like. I&#x27;ll try again with another seller as I love this cream and it does work especially after I do peels.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Thick moisturizer/cream and relatively decent ingredients...no fragrance. I alternate with my Rhonda Allison skincare when my skin is needing some heavy duty moisture and it does the trick!</li>
    <li> I decided t buy this after using sample, don&#x27;t know why but It didn&#x27;t work that as dramatic as the sample that I used before. maybe the sample was for sensitive skins. still gentle though</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful!</li>
    <li> I recently had a chemical peel done, I used this during the recovery process and did not have any breakouts or excessive skin irritation.</li>
    <li> My hairstylist gave me some of this cream a long time ago for my daughter&#x27;s finger. My daughter scraped her finger pretty badly &amp; this cream helped heal it pretty fast! I was impressed! I had a cut above my ear that wouldn&#x27;t seem to heal &amp; this cream did the trick! Love it!!!</li>
    <li> recommended by my dermatologist</li>
    <li> Love it love it...i bought many of the avene products...my skin likes it..when ever u need moisturizer and which doesn&#x27;t clog the pores...that what i need... Day or night...great</li>
    <li> This product changed my skin. Over the 3 years I have used it, I gave gone from gravel face to baby bottom blemish free</li>
    <li> My medical aesthetician recommended Cicalfate as I was having some irritation the first few weeks of using Obagi Nu Derm. The skin around my mouth and chin was red, flaky and raw. The Cicalfate has done wonders improving my skin and reducing the redness and irritation. She gave me a generous sample but I bought a tube because I was so impressed. I still use it occasionally- I am only four weeks into the Obagi and while my skin is adjusting well, I do get occasional redness. The Cicalfate soothes &amp; clears it up amazingly well. I have nothing but raves for this product!</li>
    <li> A friend told me about this cream. My skin has been so dry and scaly. Ordered this product along with Avene therma spring water. Amazing stuff. Dryness and irritation gone.</li>
    <li> I read the other reviews about this skin cream containing alot of water but decided to try it anyway and sure enough it was full of water.  I had to drain out the water and place cream in another container to get the right consistancy.  It also did nothing for my skin problem.  A friend of mine gets it from her dermatologist and she assures me that she never has a trace of water. Would never buy this online again!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist for a form of Eczema.  It seemed to make a difference within just 1 day, with the itchiness disappearing, and the redness becoming lighter.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist. I believe it did what she wanted it to do.  My skin healed well.</li>
    <li> This may not a magic but it reduced red spot and relived my sensitive skin. I used to put some strong spot treatment whenever my skin breaks out, but one I tired to use this cream ( it takes little while ), it doesn&#x27;t gives me a strong pain also did not make my skin burn and irritate.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. More than satisfied</li>
    <li> This cream protects and is great for extremely delicate skin. I used it after a laser peel and it never hurt to use on raw red new skin. Will keep stocked with the cream because of  it&#x27;s calming properties.</li>
    <li> I use this product for my neck surgery scar, I started right after removing the blasters on the wound, non irritating very light and non greasy almost creamy and soft. no smell. I just use it every night and leave the wound open.&lt;br /&gt;great for sensitive skins.</li>
    <li> Great cream for dry skin.</li>
    <li> So greasy. A lot of water came out first. It made me thought that liquid is the cream. It must be run out fast. But no. The real cream was still inside. Is it how it suppose to be or it&#x27;s just poor quality?? Anyway, I used it. No better or worse. Thanks God.</li>
    <li> Love it. I have very sensitive skin, but it works well for mu skin. My skin is getting better and healed!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, and this lotion does not make me break out and it leaves my skin very soft. However, it has not helped with the redness like I was hoping it would.</li>
    <li> I love using this cream all over my face at night before bed time. It calms down skin if there is redness and also great after a glycolic peel.</li>
    <li> This product is a lifesaver if you have overdone a chemical peel or retinoid treatment, or just had laser treatments....it will instantly soothe and cool your skin and it works magic, the dead skin just slides right off and redness goes away. If my skin is really irritated, I wear it at home 24/7 like a mask. You can sleep in it without fear, I have never had it stain any clothing or linens. I have never found another product which does what this does, and I have very sensitive skin. Their thermal water spray is also very soothing. Even filtered tap water stings and burns my skin when it is aggravated, but the Avene water does not. One caveat, do not accept any product which is separated. This happens if it gets below freezing during shipment. It can not be mixed back together (I tried) and my derms office where I bought it gave me a refund and told me to try using it anyway. Well, I did and the stuff was not up to par compared to an undamaged tube. I noticed a big difference in efficacy. I am not sure if this is so cheap here (normal price is $28 a tube) because they are selling damaged tubes? I have only bought this from my derm&#x27;s office and drugstore dot com so I am not sure about this vendor on Amazon, if it is coming from the manufacturer or some reseller?</li>
    <li> Love it! I really think this helps my skin restore and vitalize :)</li>
    <li> So my mom mentioned this product to me and I recently had two moles removed and have been using it post surgery (after it was safe to do so) twice a day and it really helps with my ski healing. You can also use it on your face, neck or any area that might be irritated.</li>
    <li> This product did not arrive quickly and was very watery and not creamy as it should be. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> My wife bought it for my daughter and she is happy with the results. It definitely helped in her recovery.</li>
    <li> Not as helpful as expected. Ok.</li>
    <li> The bottle contained three quarters of water.  I don&#x27;t think this is appropriate.  Do you?</li>
    <li> I was looking for a creme with zinc and found this one which is just amazing. So far I was always very lucky with European products.</li>
    <li> Had major facial electrolysis and this cream was wonderful.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, this cream helps my skin heal after cuts or skin biopsy. It&#x27;s very thick, smooth, and unscented.</li>
    <li> During winter time I get really dry skin. I usually use aqua glycolic face cream, which is amazing too. But during the day I don&#x27;t like using that much glycolic base creams coz of the sun. I read recently in instyle magazine a famous dermatologist speak and recommend this product as a face cream to restore natural ph. It does work fantastic!!!! And the best part it&#x27;s not greasy at all. It leaves your skin soft and hydrated. As this doctor calls it &amp;#34; miracle cream&amp;#34; which is very true. Amazingly enough is not only designed for that, you can also use it to restore your ph in any other part of your body.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this lotion for years. I always get it from different places, sometimes amazon, sometimes from my esthetician&#x27;s office. But this time the product was not up to par. A ton of water came out when I first opened it, and it continues to happen. I actually just stopped using it because it was creeping me out a little bit.</li>
    <li> I have extremely oily skin and have just recently learned how to control it.  I bought this after reading reviews and it meets ALL my expectations and more.  It does not clog my pores, heals any &amp;#34;boo boos&amp;#34; I might have and makes my skin incredibly soft.  This is a must have for all skin types!</li>
    <li> I &#x27;m not a person who can easily find a skin prodcut I like , however this is greart . In addition it is very good at decreasing skin breakdown&lt;br /&gt;pw independence, missouri</li>
    <li> My veterinarian actually prescribed this for my kitten for a scar on his nose (from falling from a tree).  I definitely see improvement.  It must be pretty mild if it can be used on little pets with no skin irritation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been in Dermatololy skin care since July, mostly for basel cell carcinoma.  I have used this cream and it certainly has helped in the recovery of my face skin.  Give it a try.</li>
    <li> It provides quite a lot of moisture but it feels grease on the skin. I like to use it around my nose during the winter time.</li>
    <li> Be careful when u purchase it in winter! Low temperature will seperate it into water and cream.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway this is perfect item if u have sensitive skin. I love it!</li>
    <li> I have acne and a sensitive combination skin. My skin has been dry lately and many avene &amp;#34;hydrating&amp;#34; lotion don&#x27;t do the job. I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. The texture of this cream is thick and oily after I put it on my face but the cream is absorbed slowly into my skin through the night as I use this as my &amp;#34;night lotion&amp;#34;. I have been using this cream for 2 weeks and my acne has reduced since, and in addition to my acne red scars fading away. Though this is no miracle cream, I&#x27;d still recommend this cream as it does its job to control my acne.</li>
    <li> expected better &amp;#34;restoration&amp;#34; of skin.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this product to me after some recent facial surgery.  I tried it and have been faithfully applying it twice daily with great results.  The scars are fading very quickly.  While the product seems a bit greasy at first, I have found that it does not cause my skin to break out and I can easily apply makeup over it without loss of coverage.  A little goes a long way.  I have been using this for about two months and have more than half a tube left.</li>
    <li> This very hard to find product is one of my favorite beauty products!  I use it after a peel or at night before bed if my skin is feeling particularly dry.  Love that it is not greasy and feels soft and smooth, almost like water.  If you have a scratch or boo boo put a little of Cicalfate cream on it and it almost disappears.</li>
    <li> This product is not like the one I ordered earlier. it is very watery. When you shake the tube you can here the water in it.  I tried to shake to mix it up but it would not mix up.  I ordered two of them and the other one is the same way.  Very disappointed with this order.</li>
    <li> Avene Cicalfate works well on dry hands and also helps me&lt;br /&gt;when I have a small cut . It does a nice job doing that!</li>
    <li> Love love this cream. Best product from avene. So moisturizing. Goes on thick but melts into a lighter style cream that can work in any season. So hydrating, especially when nothing else seems to combat my dry cheeks.</li>
    <li> Perfect for recovering from laser facial procedure. I continue to use it as a night cream mixed 50/50 with Aquafore as recommended by derm for recovery period and beyond. We live in a high and dry climate, requiring gobs of lotion. Just using this at night effectively reduces need for heavy lotions during the day.</li>
    <li> arrived &amp;#34;separated&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s just how it&#x27;s supposed to be.  I opened it and all this liquid poured out and then upon squeezing there was a more solid &amp;#34;lotion.&amp;#34;  I tried it once and it&#x27;s been sitting in my drawer.</li>
    <li> I found a cream that works. It&#x27;s a bit pricey but well worth the money. You only need to use a small amount. as a matter of fact, I need to order more.&lt;br /&gt;Linda Sheahan</li>
    <li> What I thought it would be like</li>
    <li> great as a night time mask after retin A sensative skin, brilliant for any skin iritations on the face like dry patches, sensative areas.</li>
    <li> This is NOT authentic. Water leaks out like crazy and not just after initial use. This has never happened with any of the tubes purchased at the dermatologist. After further inspection, the tube is not the same. This has to be fake - consistency is not anywhere close to original. Very disappointed and I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I like this cream. It gives my sensitive skin relief and helps the redness to go away. Very nice product.</li>
    <li> Several reviewers commented on a clear liquid seeping out, especially when the tube is first opened. After receiving such a tube, I bought one from my dermatologist. It had the same problem, but it still worked. After opening the tube, store it with the cap down, as shown in the photo. A little clear liquid is a small problem for such a great product.</li>
    <li> The tube was full of water. It had mor wather than cream.</li>
    <li> My Dr recommended this after my surgery for the treatment of my damaged skin.  It keeps my skin moisturized and helps heal and reduce the scarring.  It works great.</li>
    <li> Great transaction. This product does seem to have a lot of water in it. Perhaps more than past purchases.</li>
    <li> Good product but not work for me.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much. It feels clean and is very softening on the skin. I ordered two tubes this time to make sure I had a supply of it. I is easy to travel with, too.</li>
    <li> This was disappointing...it was very watery:(</li>
    <li> I love this restorative cream, but is what very runny and more water came out than cream.&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased this item before and never had this problem.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping..</li>
