      <li>I can&#x27;t find the tins locally which last a long time but this product is also available in a squeeze tube.</li>
      <li>But, like most people, I hate how greasy most lotions make your hands feel.</li>
      <li>It works very well on dry skin renewing the dry areas back to normal.  </li>
      <li>I shared it with my 87 year old Mother, who thought nothing could help her dry hands.</li>

    <li> This cream works well to help to prevent the cracked skin on my hands in the winter.  There&#x27;s a slight odor but once I&#x27;ve rubbed it on my hands, I can hardly detect the scent.  There&#x27;s a shiny residue but it&#x27;s not too greasy feeling.  I&#x27;ve tried O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s, Bag Balm, Aquaphor, and Jack Black; Glysomed works better for me.  I&#x27;ve had this jar for about a month and there&#x27;s plenty of cream left in it for next winter.  I also use the Avon silicone glove.  Only one crack in the past month where I generally get several.</li>
    <li> Glysomed Hand Cream does have a bit of a greasy feeling to begin with but if you can put up with it the results are pretty amazing. I love how my hands feel in the long run: soft and silky.</li>
    <li> I have a difficult time w/ my hands being dry in the winter and this stuff works better than anything else I have tried to heal the dryness. Smart buy!</li>
    <li> It works very well on dry skin renewing the dry areas back to normal.  I would recommend it and will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> A friend turned me on to this hand cream a few years ago, and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since! It&#x27;s not greasy, and my hands are still moisturized even after I wash them. Amazing product!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I shared it with my 87 year old Mother, who thought nothing could help her dry hands. Well I will be ordering Glysomed Hand Cream for her so I can have mine back.&lt;br /&gt;I just wish it were available in the stores. This product is Amazing.</li>
    <li> My hands get dry and cracked in the winter. But, like most people, I hate how greasy most lotions make your hands feel. This stuff isn&#x27;t immune to that greasy feeling completely, but it&#x27;s much better than any standard drug store lotion I&#x27;ve tried. And the nice thing is, even though it&#x27;s only a 5 oz. container, you need very, very little to get the job done, since it&#x27;s very dense. I&#x27;ve had the same container for over a year and expect it to last quite a bit longer still.</li>
    <li> My hands get dry every winter.  I tried all most every type of creams on the market.  This is the one and only one works for me.  I have been using it for the last three years.</li>
    <li> I have been using this hand cream for many years. It provides a protective layer on you hands but isn&#x27;t overly oily. I can&#x27;t find the tins locally which last a long time but this product is also available in a squeeze tube. Good product for people who wash their hands frequently or need extra care during the winter. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I love using this at night before bed and then putting my hands in some soft gloves.  then, i wake up with baby skin!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff !!! Best hand cream ever !!!</li>
    <li> Best handcreme on the market.  My hands are in &amp; out of water constantly.  This is my go to.  Good stuff!</li>
    <li> This product is not available locally.  SO GLAD I FOUND IT!!  It works so very much better than anything else!</li>
    <li> My husband does a LOT of handwashing and his hands are always so dry and cracked. After two nights of applying Glysomed Hand Cream at bedtime, his hands are smooth and healthy. It&#x27;s been a week since the last application and his hands are still smooth! Love it!</li>

    <li> the best for dry skin</li>
    <li> Really good hand cream but boy is it pricey. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the $$. That is just not necessary.</li>
    <li> FOR MY WIFE  recommended by philippinos for philippinos.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product, but a rediculous price. It is three times what it should cost. It is a Canadian product and I&#x27;d expect to pay a bit more but not that much more!</li>
