      <li>The best hair remover for my mustache...</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
      <li>Best investment of my life my face gets so hairy it does not hurt after the 2/3 times</li>
      <li>works perfectly!</li>
      <li>It takes a while to get the hang of it, but once you do you will give up tweezers for good!</li>

      <li>lol</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m really happy with it.  </li>
      <li>Amazing and  works perfect</li>
      <li>lol</li>
      <li>Works great and a good alternative to threading.</li>
      <li>If this isn&#x27;t a good explanation, go on YouTube and watch &amp;#34;ItsMyRayeRaye&amp;#34;&#x27;s hair removal video.</li>
      <li>This hair remover works surprisingly well.</li>
      <li>This one is not as good or thorough.</li>
      <li>Both are good, though.</li>
      <li>and I loved the price.</li>
      <li>Comes with good instructions for cleaning the spring and your face to prevent this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am very happy I decided to try this product, it was well worth the price!</li>
      <li>I am very satisfied.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>It took a while to get the hang of it, but once you do, you will be really pleased!</li>
      <li>Love this torture device!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>It did hurt but it was tolerable and it grabs so many hairs at a time!</li>
      <li>&quot; I&#x27;ll probably develop a technique, but for now it&#x27;s kind of a matter of just moving it around against my skin and twisting the ends</li>
      <li>This product is painfully effective.</li>
      <li>Nothing has been so effective.</li>
      <li>Nice and effective.</li>
      <li>Kind of tricky to make it work.</li>
      <li>This is not the case for my daughter, but her skin is like a nice tan color.</li>
      <li>I honestly had my doubts when I ordered it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m more than happy with this purchase, much better than the $16 - $20 price for the REM Spring.</li>
      <li>so when I watch I can also &amp;#34;pluck away&amp;#34; with this handy tool.  </li>
      <li>The tool is handy but doesn&#x27;t always pull the hair out from the root.</li>
      <li>Great for travel and quick plucking</li>
      <li>If you want to remove hair easily, effectively,  and precisely, buy this product !</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s so easy!</li>
      <li>but this was easy to use and extremely effective.  </li>
      <li>This one seems like a &amp;#34;tighter spring than the R.E.M. ever did, and that may be what causes more pain.</li>
      <li>There are videos on YouTube which dial you in on how to use them most effectively.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
      <li>This threading tool causes me considerably greater flicking pain than the R.E.M. threading tool.</li>
      <li>Might work better for women</li>
      <li>Also,  I still use it, every week or more often!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I was such a skeptic, but it works perfectly!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
      <li>LOVE THE RESULTS</li>
      <li>Once she got the hang of it, she was able to do it herself.</li>
      <li>but I found that many times the hair would just slide in between the thread and never did get pulled off</li>
      <li>also have some course, darker hairs and this tool got most of those as well.  </li>
      <li>I think the tool grabs the hairs you most want to be grabbed-</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT</li>
      <li>I saw an item like this being sold on QVC for much more money, and I thought &amp;</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to make sure I use this before getting my teeth cleaned.</li>
      <li>I got it in the mail and just couldn&#x27;t help but use it right away, and I am very satisfied.</li>
      <li>He grows strong trees on his face though so maybe it would work better for men with finer hair.</li>
      <li>Of corse it&#x27;s not the most comfortable thing but compared to waxing and tweezing</li>
      <li>This is so cool!</li>
      <li>All the review comments are true!</li>
      <li>It is so easy to use.</li>
      <li>This is so easy</li>
      <li>It is fairly easy to use.  </li>
      <li>This tool grabbed all the fine hairs easily.  </li>
      <li>this product works just fine.</li>
      <li>My hair is really fine and light, so it wasn&#x27;t a necessity to find products to remove it.</li>
      <li>One thing i can say does work great for the upper lip.</li>
      <li>i got this as i realized how cheap it was, and was thinking it wouldn&#x27;t even work..</li>
      <li>I only bought this one because it had really good reviews and said it was better than the original.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super cheap, about $3.00 total, works &amp; lasts great.</li>
      <li>quick and easy..</li>
      <li>but I can see how if you don&#x27;t clean the spring/</li>
      <li>so I used it right out of the package!</li>
      <li>This tool will be used for years and makes me feel more confident that I can quickly take care of myself and not feel self conscious that the hair will show up again quickly or in patches like with shaving.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have much hair to pluck, maybe it is more efficient for women with thicker \\&quot;fuzz.\\</li>
      <li>/&gt;After each full threading I apply some cocoa butter to the areas I threaded.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and very fast at it as well.</li>
      <li>significant other/roommate/parent/cat/parent&#x27;s cat will laugh at you.</li>
      <li>particular hair threading tool is very nice, it&#x27;s very inexpensive, and works very well.</li>
      <li>Sure enough, they did and at a much better price.  </li>
      <li>This was the most expensive and best quality.</li>
      <li>Adequate.</li>
      <li>So with that said, it is definitely worth it, very fast and easy...</li>
      <li>The new one seems to grab better and was cheaper than this one</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good getting peach fuzz that you really don&#x27;t want ripped out, because those hairs are barely noticeable.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t get rid of my tweezers but this DOES work pretty well!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Sellers were pricky to me for this review which I actually considered a positive review... positive but honest about the pain.&lt;br /&gt;However, I have gotten more used to the threader over time but it still hurts.</li>
      <li>This little tool is GREAT.  </li>
      <li>It works great, but she does say that it is not comfortable.</li>
      <li>I kind of want my 4 bucks back.</li>
      <li>It works far better than the others on the market.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>just right you wind up with breakage.</li>
      <li>People who said that their hairs went between it and that it doesnt work for their hair were not doing it right,</li>
      <li>Fast, no fuss, and clean.</li>
      <li>Maybe fair skinned people or those with sensitive skin have more trouble with that.</li>
      <li>Hair breaks and regrow hair very fast ....</li>
      <li>I would even go so far as to recommend taking it with you in you makeup pouch or purse daily just in case because it is so quick and effective.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is fairly easy to use.  I just went on YouTube and found some helpful tutorials.  It doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs (especially coarse hairs) and it&#x27;s hard to try to get just that one stubborn hair or even a patch of stubborn hairs.  It&#x27;s good getting peach fuzz that you really don&#x27;t want ripped out, because those hairs are barely noticeable.  Back to lazer I go:(</li>
    <li> I am a PCOS sufferer and have some unfortunate chin hairs.  I had been going to the salon to have them threaded, but I am saving a load of money now that I can do it myself!  Just a note:  the insert warns not to use it on the eyebrows. I contemplated it, but after using, quickly realized that you don&#x27;t maintain enough control to do your eyebrows.  Don&#x27;t risk it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m post-menopausal with ugly facial hair dangling from my chin &amp; checks. Yuck! Depilatory creams burn &amp; blister my skin.  Wax strips pretty ineffective so not cost-effective.  This little tool is GREAT.  I&#x27;ve been using tweezers to pluck out hairs, like your eyebrows.  So by now my skin is accustomed to plucking pain! I keep  this little tool by the TV so when I watch I can also &amp;#34;pluck away&amp;#34; with this handy tool.  Use it 2-3 times per week &amp; no more shaggy face! No more l-o-n-g hairs twirling from my cheeks! It hurts like when you pluck your eyebrows. It takes some experience to get used to it ... but it&#x27;s better than blistering creams, very expensive home lasers &amp; chintsy wax strips.  I recommend &amp; would buy again.  Timely delivery ... I have Amazon Prime.</li>
    <li> I accidentally stumbled across a generic version of this item on YouTube and intrigued by its premise searched for it on Amazon. Whoever came up with this concept is a genius. It&#x27;s totally not what I expected. Removes facial hair quickly, efficiently, and relatively painlessly. You can do this while watching television in just under a couple of minutes. Simple to use. Well worth the money. Highly recommended. I&#x27;ll also be gifting this item to some of my friends.</li>
    <li> Best investment of my life my face gets so hairy it does not hurt after the 2/3 times</li>
    <li> works perfectly! hurts a bit for the upper lip, but it really works!</li>
    <li> I simply love this little hair removing item! It works like a charm. I honestly had my doubts when I ordered it. To my surprise its even better than other epilators! I definitely recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> This product is painfully effective. It took a bit more time than usual to arrive for some reason, but when it came I was immediately using it right out of the box. I have never used a threading tool before, but other reviews made it sound like it was going to take a lot of time to figure out which was ridiculous because it is super simple. All you have to do is bend it away from the hairs and than straighten it and than pull (quickly so as not to prolong the pain). When using it above the lip it is very fast and I [had] a lot of fine blonde hair so it took a little time to get it all when using a mirror. People who said that their hairs went between it and that it doesnt work for their hair were not doing it right, and I really cant imagine what they were doing instead. I used a rolling action instead of pulling but I dont think it really matters because once that hair is grabbed it is going unless you release it. It would have been nearly impossible to do this amount of work with a tweezer and no hand cramping or expensive hair remover creams so you save tons of money and time and even pain. Besides it being painful (which really isnt so terrible after a moment), the only other downside is that sometimes when you are focusing on one area you may grab extra hairs from other areas but this can be prevented simply by bending it again to release the hairs..or you could consider it an advantage if you have a lot of work to do like I did. So with that said, it is definitely worth it, very fast and easy...DO NOT USE IT ON YOU EYEBROWS! It&#x27;s too big for that area so you are better off just tweezing there, which should be simple enough. If you are like me and have upper lip and chin/under chin area hair from super fine to coarse, this will work very well. Plus there is no risk of losing skin like when waxing and you wont even need a mirror but it does help when you are getting down to the last few stubborn hairs or to see how you did. I have tried waxing and even shaving my face in the past, and as a woman it is very embarrassing to shave my face, especially when it creates a \\&quot;five o&#x27;clock shadow\\&quot; look and the waxing is scarier because you run the risk of losing skin and its just too expensive. This tool will be used for years and makes me feel more confident that I can quickly take care of myself and not feel self conscious that the hair will show up again quickly or in patches like with shaving. I would even go so far as to recommend taking it with you in you makeup pouch or purse daily just in case because it is so quick and effective. If you aren&#x27;t scared of brief pain and dont want to dish out money every month or week on hair remover creams, waxes or treatments than give this a try because you really cant lose and I think you will be pleasantly surprised. Wish I had it a few years ago when it was brought to my attention that I had \\&quot;peach fuzz\\&quot; which later grew to be much more obnoxious. Mother&#x27;s side of the family is hairy. LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*update* Tested it on my husband&#x27;s facial hair and as another person said, this does not appear to work too well on men&#x27;s facial hair. He grows strong trees on his face though so maybe it would work better for men with finer hair.</li>
    <li> Ouch (a little) but it works. Awkward to get used to but practice makes perfect.</li>
    <li> As soon as I got the tool I tried it out hoping for something that works faster then plucking with a tweezers. This was not it for me, the handles popped off so you can&#x27;t get a tight grip, the spring is to soft/bendy, overall a waste of money, if I didn&#x27;t have to pay shipping back I would send it back. I kind of want my 4 bucks back. If I didn&#x27;t have to make a 20 word or longer review my review would have been just one word, Boo!</li>
    <li> Works great and a good alternative to threading. But it is painful if you don&#x27;t use it for couple of days as the hair grows. I usually use it after bath every alternate days as the moisture allows the hair out easily. Great for travel and quick plucking</li>
    <li> I had used cream-removers in the the past but waxing always scared me. My hair is really fine and light, so it wasn&#x27;t a necessity to find products to remove it. I saw this product for only $3 and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I have had it 3 weeks and have used it weekly. I did need to get used to the feeling of having hair pulled out from the root, but really the pain isn&#x27;t that bad except for right in the middle of the upper-lip. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever get used that tingly pain. I think the tool grabs the hairs you most want to be grabbed- the coarser or longer than peach fuzz hairs. If you want all you peach fuzz gone it would take some time.</li>
    <li> Horrible, torture product. Unless you have very long hair it will not grab anything. It will pinch and grab your skin though... ouch! It&#x27;s not very useful at all.</li>
    <li> this product was everything it said it would be.  I like how it works, and its just what the description said it was</li>
    <li> The best hair remover for my mustache... quick and easy.. I LOVE IT</li>
    <li> little hard to use a first but works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> This thread tool works very well however, it is such as pain to take off your facial hair! it hurts like heck! however it does its job.</li>
    <li> Amazing and  works perfect and I loved the price.</li>
    <li> Great tool. Fast, no fuss, and clean. I use it every other day and feel it&#x27;s much better than  waxing which not only pulls your skin, but hurts much more. Tweezers take too much time and can&#x27;t clean above the lip area well. Only thing is the eyes. You still have to use the tweezers for the eye area. But I&#x27;m really happy with it.  I order 3 threading tools. This was the most expensive and best quality. The other two&#x27;s coils were looser and lighter. I returned the other two and will be ordering this as stocking stuffers for all my girlfriends :-)</li>
    <li> \\&quot;I Love this simple little implement of torture. Yes, it hurts like hell, especially above the upper lip... O.M.F.G! But, I&#x27;m getting used to it &amp; now I just roll it whenever I&#x27;m ready, reading at the computer, watching TV, or whatever. I still wince &amp; yelp for the upper lip hair but this really rids the face-fuzz for days, w/ just a touch up now &amp; then. No more tweezing - no chemicals.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After each full threading I apply some cocoa butter to the areas I threaded. My skin gets immediately soothed &amp; comforted &amp; it keeps those areas smooth/soft (I use cocoa butter the Yellow stick &#x3D; [[ASIN:B0014AX89K Cococare \\&quot;The Yellow Stick\\&quot; 100% Cocoa Butter]]. It&#x27;s super cheap, about $3.00 total, works &amp; lasts great. I use it anywhere I need softening: on my body, hands, face, and lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular hair threading tool is very nice, it&#x27;s very inexpensive, and works very well. I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase. This one is cheap enough to buy an extra for your makeup bag, for touch ups or those pesky hairs that seem to have gotten a dose of miracle gro over night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THE RESULTS &amp; it really is simple, safe, &amp; effective!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sellers were pricky to me for this review which I actually considered a positive review... positive but honest about the pain.&lt;br /&gt;However, I have gotten more used to the threader over time but it still hurts. That&#x27;s just a fact. Also,  I still use it, every week or more often!&lt;br /&gt;I have also found that Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel; plain, with cucumber, or with rose works very well to sooth the redness and discomfort... which is always there whether the sellers like it or not!</li>
    <li> It works but it HURTS!  I suppose not more so than threading hurts, but once you get all the hair removed, if you do a little every day it doesn&#x27;t hurt near as much.  I am not good or consistent going to get my lip threaded, so by the time I do make it to the salon, there is much to be zipped out and it hurts SO much.  For this reason I really like the tool.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because my mom had one and recommended it to me. When you first start using it.....it&#x27;s going to hurt a little bit. You do get used to it and I also found that applying a cold rag or ice on area before using this tool helps. Or after you get out of shower. I get a few dark hairs on my chin and some peach fuzz above my upper lip and this sucker gets it all! Would definitely purchase again. Only 4 stars simply because of pain, sometimes tweezers hurt less</li>
    <li> i got this as i realized how cheap it was, and was thinking it wouldn&#x27;t even work.. It worked amazing, i haven&#x27;t had any facial hair for almost 10 days now, not that painful and you can do it anywhere even in front of tv or if you plan to travel.... I would recommend it</li>
    <li> Once I understood how the item works. It worked great for me! Thank you for your affordable product. The product has saved me time and money.</li>
    <li> I got this for my teenaged daughter. She was naughty when she was younger and tried to shave her face with my husband&#x27;s razor. In doing so, she caused her facial hair to grow quite a bit. She was embarrassed by the hair that was dark and thick above her lip. I decided to try the threading tool because it seemed simple and it was not expensive. It works great, but she does say that it is not comfortable. Pulling hair out by the roots is never comfortable. Once she got the hang of it, she was able to do it herself. She uses it once every couple of weeks. The hair is coming back a little thinner each time. I hope we can someday not worry about threading at all, but until then, will continue to use it. Some reviewers have complained about the skin being red and blotchy afterward. This is not the case for my daughter, but her skin is like a nice tan color. Maybe fair skinned people or those with sensitive skin have more trouble with that. We are happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Hair removal help made easy but still painful. The tool is handy but doesn&#x27;t always pull the hair out from the root. For such an inexpensive price, it doesn&#x27;t bother me either way. One thing i can say does work great for the upper lip. Don&#x27;t dare use it on your eyebrows...I can only imagine the horror it would cause.</li>
    <li> I saved lot of money with this . But only problem it does not pull the hair properly . Hair breaks and regrow hair very fast ....</li>
    <li> This threading tool causes me considerably greater flicking pain than the R.E.M. threading tool. Both are good, though. This one seems like a &amp;#34;tighter spring than the R.E.M. ever did, and that may be what causes more pain. Remember, the pain is still just momentary; and this type of hair removal saves you money. And you can do this anytime you need to without running out to pay someone to do it or spending money on product that you can&#x27;t use quickly enough and it then loses its potency.</li>
    <li> Maybe for some, but not me!  I found the threading tool more painful than waxing.  I also thought it broke the hair rather than pulling it out.  I still use it from time to time if I&#x27;m in a hurry and don&#x27;t want to deal with waxing.</li>
    <li> I bought this so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to use chemicals/create waste for hair removal.  It works pretty well.  Tip: pull the handles just slightly when you put it on the area, then roll the handles for threading.  This helps the hair start captured in the tool.  It pulls the hair more from the root (instead of breaking off some) and works quicker (less threading passes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are warnings sent with this tool.  Heed these warnings.  I didn&#x27;t read them initially and was excited to try the tool on my eye brows...DONT.  It will also catch your eyelashes.</li>
    <li> I saw an item like this being sold on QVC for much more money, and I thought &amp;#34;I&#x27;ll bet Amazon has those&amp;#34;.  Sure enough, they did and at a much better price.  This hair remover works surprisingly well. It kinda pulls a little sometimes, but let&#x27;s face it - you&#x27;re basically tweezing with it.  Just a couple of minutes is all it takes to tidy up those annoying facial hairs.  Small enough to throw in when you&#x27;re traveling too.</li>
    <li> Well! All the review comments are true! It hurts to pull out the tiny hairs. At first, I used a magnifying mirror, but soon caught on to the technique and can use it while watching TV. You know it is working because of the pain. I was looking forward to the Chinese directions but they are now in English. I&#x27;m going to make sure I use this before getting my teeth cleaned. Can you imagine the facial hairs the hygienist has to see?</li>
    <li> Does not hurt as bad as they say it does.</li>
    <li> Arrived rusted!! Would send it back but it&#x27;s not worth it to send back. Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I am a \\&quot;furry\\&quot; guy and have too much hair growing on my upper cheeks and I bout this to remove that hair but I found that many times the hair would just slide in between the thread and never did get pulled off all it gave me was all of the pain without the hair removal. Might work better for women</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product, but did not really work for me. Perhaps it will work with longer hair.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for!  I have a lot of fine blonde facial hairs that are impossible to tweeze - and I hate depilatory creams.  This tool grabbed all the fine hairs easily.  And it only took me a few tries to get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have some course, darker hairs and this tool got most of those as well.  I just followed up with tweezers to get any stragglers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was pretty painless too, except for the first time I did my upper lip...but I just powered through it.  All the maintenance on my upper lip since has been much easier.</li>
    <li> I had another one of these in a different brand. I should have gotten the same one.  This one is not as good or thorough. I only bought this one because it had really good reviews and said it was better than the original. I ended up getting a new one in a different brand. The new one seems to grab better and was cheaper than this one</li>
    <li> I got it in the mail and just couldn&#x27;t help but use it right away, and I am very satisfied. It&#x27;s easy to use and very fast at it as well. I just used it on my upper lip and it is now hair free, and it was faster than any of the times that I used wax. I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Hurts like the dickens! lol The spring &#x27;sprung&#x27; after a handful of uses and now it is useless. I don&#x27;t know if I want the torture again so I haven&#x27;t replaced it.</li>
    <li> This is so cool! You can sit and watch TV and do this at the same time. You don&#x27;t really need a mirror unless you have a stubborn hair that won&#x27;t come out. I DO think if you let the hairs get a little longer (1/8 inch) they would be easier to grab. I wouldn&#x27;t get rid of my tweezers but this DOES work pretty well!</li>
    <li> I was so skeptical about this thing when I saw it. How could this spring thing remove unwanted facial hair?! But then bought it just as an add-on purchase and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I watched some youtube videos on how to use it before I got it so I used it right out of the package! It is so easy to use. You just bend the spring in an upside down U shape and then twirl the sides toward you. I first used it on my upper lip and it did hurt because there were lots of little hairs there. It did hurt but it was tolerable and it grabs so many hairs at a time! It&#x27;s so much better than plucking every little hair and the spring doesn&#x27;t miss much, trust me, you will feel it! This little thing is so odd but it&#x27;s awesome! No more plucking (except eyebrows) or chemical creams! Buy this, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love this torture device! Works really well! DONT use it by your brows or you might get your eyelashes sucked in! lol</li>
    <li> If you are searching for a solution to be gone of unwanted facial hair, look no further! I just got this product in the mail yesterday and wanted to see if it would get rid of the hair on my upper lip. I had heard from several reviews that this will hurt pretty bad when using this kind of device, but I was actually surprised that it wasn&#x27;t so bad! I have waxed before, so that may be the reason why, but my lip was hardly red after I was finished. Anyways, to get this to work you bend it in a U and then twist the sides back and forth over the hairs. It took a while to get the hang of it, but once you do, you will be really pleased! It did not removed every little hair on my upper lip, but I would say it got majority and feels like I just waxed it. I am very happy I decided to try this product, it was well worth the price!</li>
    <li> Once you do however they are the absolute ticket for facial hair removal.  There are videos on YouTube which dial you in on how to use them most effectively.&lt;br /&gt;Just a few minutes and any unwanted fuzz is gone.</li>
    <li> Mine arrived yesterday and is badly rusted. And at 6.99 I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s even worth the effort it will take to return it.</li>
    <li> My daughter says it works well</li>
    <li> I was a user of the Bellebe for a long time.  When it was out of stock, I bought this one.  I think I actually prefer this one.  The spring seems tighter and removes the hair quick, easier and with a little less pain.</li>
    <li> this product works just fine. I was disappointed when i saw that it was hot pink and not red. Also, the packaging is plastic wrapping, so there is nowhere to be put away.</li>
    <li> Holy jesus mother of god does this thing hurt. I&#x27;ve never waxed before so I can&#x27;t say whether this hurts more or less than waxing, but those first few rolls across the face were almost unbearable. But I assume it&#x27;s like when you first pluck your eyebrows, and then later you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Removed upper-lip peach fuzz pretty well. Cheaper than going to get it waxed, I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-If you don&#x27;t roll it just right you wind up with breakage. I think I could get better at this with practice, but I wound up with some hairs that remained because they broke off and were still visible, but too short for the spring to catch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Had to roll over the same area multiple times to get all of the hair. This increases the hurtiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Haven&#x27;t had a problem with breakouts yet (only used once) but I can see how if you don&#x27;t clean the spring/your face that this could happen. Comes with good instructions for cleaning the spring and your face to prevent this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Your significant other/roommate/parent/cat/parent&#x27;s cat will laugh at you. It looks ridiculous to roll this spring over your face over and over while trying not to cry.</li>
    <li> I love it! I have a lot of blonde hairs and some corse black hairs. They really embaress me and I got to the point where I was picking at them so much that it would result in scaring. I used to use cremes, at home waxes,  and tweezing. Nothing has been so effective. I have sensitive skin so other methods made my skin red and I would break out. I couldnt even get a wax because my skin would be red and swolen for 48+ hours. This is so easy and I honestly do not think it&#x27;s painful. Of corse it&#x27;s not the most comfortable thing but compared to waxing and tweezing it&#x27;s so easy! I have no affiliation with the company but for the price and effectiveness, I highly approve this product. If you want to remove hair easily, effectively,  and precisely, buy this product !</li>
    <li> Not having any experience with similar products, all I can say is it works and it doesn&#x27;t hurt much. Not as precise as tweezers, threading or wax, so not for brows, but adequate for lip and strays in other places. Kind of tricky to make it work. I don&#x27;t have much hair to pluck, maybe it is more efficient for women with thicker \\&quot;fuzz.\\&quot; I&#x27;ll probably develop a technique, but for now it&#x27;s kind of a matter of just moving it around against my skin and twisting the ends and it catches a hair now and then. Adequate.</li>
    <li> Ouch.  It didn&#x27;t work.  Again ouch!</li>
    <li> Love this little hair removal tool... It works far better than the others on the market.  It takes a while to get the hang of it, but once you do you will give up tweezers for good!</li>
    <li> Nice and effective. Takes a little while to get used to using it. It is time consuming to remove all the facial hair that I need to get out of the way, but still worth buying.</li>
    <li> This is far less expensive than other products which look similar.  I&#x27;ve not tried the other$ but this was easy to use and extremely effective.  Not too uncomfortable, about the same as tweezing.</li>
    <li> omg this is such a convient tool! i recommend this to everyone who wants to save money &amp; remove their facial hair. Although it did hurt alot at first i got used to it &amp; i use it all the time when i see hairs growing</li>
    <li> Unbelievable! I was such a skeptic, but it works perfectly! Literally pulls out every hair, leaving your upper lip spotless. No rash, no bumps, no redness. It obviously doesn&#x27;t feel good, but if you do it quickly and in small patches, the pain is totally manageable. I did it weeks ago and only had to go back for a touch up once, but even that wasn&#x27;t necessary. This gave me my confidence back under those pesky fluorescent lights! Would highly highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have always used the original Epicare facial hair remover tool.  I thought this one would work as well.....WRONG!  This did not work at all for me.  I threw it in the trash!</li>
    <li> This spring removes hair very well, I use this for hair removal on my upper lip, chin and cheeks. It pulls out every last hair, even the ones that you can&#x27;t really see. I&#x27;m more than happy with this purchase, much better than the $16 - $20 price for the REM Spring. I would definitely recommend this. :)&lt;br /&gt;If you find that it &amp;#34;doesn&#x27;t work&amp;#34;, use a different method. I recommend bending the spring into an upside down &amp;#34;U&amp;#34; shape on the hair you want to remove (pressing the spring against your skin), straighten the spring and then roll up. If this isn&#x27;t a good explanation, go on YouTube and watch &amp;#34;ItsMyRayeRaye&amp;#34;&#x27;s hair removal video.</li>
    <li> Love it! Hurts at first but you get used to it. It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
