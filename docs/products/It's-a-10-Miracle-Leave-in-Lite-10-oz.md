<li> I recommend it to all women with thin or fine hair.</li>
<li> It protects my hair from the daily stress of blow-drying, and it works wonders as heat protection against a curling or flat iron.</li>
<li> Makes my hair and my daughters hair so soft, shiny and manageable without needing any other products!</li>
<li> While other products similar to this one have made my hair to appear greasy, limp, or thin, It&#x27;s a 10 Lite has actually added enough body and bounce to my hair that I rarely even have to style my long hair anymore.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used the regular it&#x27;s a 10 leave in but it was too heavy for my hair.</li>
<li> I recommend this product for anyone that has thinning or thin hair, wants to get out knots and not weigh down their hair.</li>
<li> It does all the things the manufacturer claims that it does, and the lite version keeps it from weighing down my hair.</li>
<li> It was recommended by my hair stylist because I have been complained about my hair being dry.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure about this stuff - I don&#x27;t find it as moisturizing as other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
<li> In felt a little heavy...</li>
<li> Just apply a small amount  - helps to comb thru tangles and defrizz hair.</li>
<li> He recommended the lite version since my hair is thin.</li>
<li> I would recommend it to any one who has thin hair.</li>

    <li> Only product I use now to untangle my hair.</li>
    <li> Love it! Can&#x27;t go a day with out it. I&#x27;ve used the regular it&#x27;s a 10 leave in but it was too heavy for my hair. This works perfect. I recommend this product. Can&#x27;t wait to try more of the product line.</li>
    <li> Amazing Product been using it for a couple of years. I would recommend it to any one who has thin hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so good.  Works great on my hair.  Like the lite the best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure about this stuff - I don&#x27;t find it as moisturizing as other products I&#x27;ve used. I love this line and can say so many great things about other products but this product didn&#x27;t do it for me. Still use it but I doubt I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> Have fine hair and at times the Keratin Leave In felt a little heavy...this is perfect for my hair texture, all the benefits and full of body.</li>
    <li> Love it! Makes my hair and my daughters hair so soft, shiny and manageable without needing any other products! So easy to use, just spray on damp hair and combs through so easily!</li>
    <li> Love this.  Have used for the last year.  The small size I was getting at the salon, cost almost as much as this large one.</li>
    <li> This product definitely has an appropriate name, because it has been a miracle for my fine, limp hair. It does all the things the manufacturer claims that it does, and the lite version keeps it from weighing down my hair. I spray it through my hair after I get out of the shower, and it detangles so well that I can run a brush through it immediately without adding further breakage to my hair. It protects my hair from the daily stress of blow-drying, and it works wonders as heat protection against a curling or flat iron. While other products similar to this one have made my hair to appear greasy, limp, or thin, It&#x27;s a 10 Lite has actually added enough body and bounce to my hair that I rarely even have to style my long hair anymore. I just blow-dry and go. It&#x27;s a 10 is available in salons, but every time I have compare prices, Amazon&#x27;s have been lower. I could not go one day without this product! I recommend it to all women with thin or fine hair.</li>
    <li> great product, easy transaction, would shop this seller again.  regular It&#x27;s a 10 is too heavy for my fine hair and i end up looking greasy.  It&#x27;s a 10 Lite is perfect.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It was recommended by my hair stylist because I have been complained about my hair being dry. He recommended the lite version since my hair is thin. I use it every day and have seen lots of improvements with the feel of my hair! This product is great for everyone! If the lite version doesn&#x27;t work for you, they have several different types of their leave-in product!</li>
    <li> Perfect! I love this product!</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD PRODUCT I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANY ONE</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even need to blowdry my hair. It comes out perfectly wavy with no frizz!</li>
    <li> Just apply a small amount  - helps to comb thru tangles and defrizz hair.</li>
