### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This thing is great!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still a great product!</li>
      <li>This is the ideal gift for your wife or girlfriend.</li>
      <li>I think the No!No! product works great.</li>
      <li>Either way, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase even, though, sometimes it&#x27;s not always that easy!</li>
      <li>Found a Pelican® Case that fits the bill, better and is better protection.</li>
      <li>It worked ok, had to shave afterwords also.</li>
      <li>So, I have to let them know and get a replacement order, which is free, but still.</li>
      <li>Watch her eyes light up.</li>
      <li>When I had originally ordered the system, I ordered one and they sent me two and charged me for both,  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been able to create a perfectly straight line like at the barber shop.  </li>
      <li>This was very misleading!!  </li>
      <li>I ordered the small area back because I wanted to be able to get the back of my neck right and the tips are the perfect size for me.  </li>
      <li>While the company was very cordial when cancelling my order, I think they have an obligation to update their product status on Amazon!</li>
      <li>When I received and used it the first time it broke the filaments immediately.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for stealing my money and not caring about your customers!</li>
      <li>The hairs grow back so much lighter and not as many.</li>
      <li>I found out  I was being charge to other payments of 85 dollars on top of my first payment of 135.</li>
      <li>Now i know it is just a buffer with a nice little zip up package to hold it in.  </li>
      <li>and then it was a real pain getting a refund.</li>
      <li>Works much much faster</li>
      <li>I ike that they came in a case which I can put the whole thing in.</li>
      <li>However I could also use the full size blades on my knees so the only area that I&#x27;m using this for is underarm.</li>
      <li>Actually the larger pice works better and does not leave strike marks on your chin .</li>
      <li>7 mos later I still have not gotten refunded for the first one and the second one I have not been able to see any lasting results.  </li>
      <li>and i am able to get every little hair!</li>
      <li>So when the first one broke they told me to send it back and keep the unused one.  </li>
      <li>I subsequently went back to the Amazon website to see if I could order it from another company...only to see that the original company is still listing it IN STOCK.  </li>
      <li>It took me six long calls over 2 months just to get the RMA in order to ship this back to the company for free (which they claimed was part of my purchase agreement).  </li>
      <li>i used this on my face and it was so much easier to move around than the regular size one.  </li>
      <li>These thing cost way too much money to not work properly.</li>
      <li>I had such high hopes for the No!No! product, but it just flat out did not work.  </li>
      <li>Purchased from HSN $276.34, used VERY infrequently, died in less than 18 months.</li>
      <li>it takes a little bit longer since you cant get as much hair at a time</li>

    <li> This product does not work.  I bought it directly from the Radiancy company, and their customer service has been horrible.  It took me six long calls over 2 months just to get the RMA in order to ship this back to the company for free (which they claimed was part of my purchase agreement).  Now that they have my nono, I still have not received a refund (2 months after sending the item back).  Very mad, and will make sure this is all over the internet.  Do not buy nono.  It is a total \\&quot;As Seen on TV\\&quot; gimmicky rip off.</li>
    <li> I think the No!No! product works great. The hairs grow back so much lighter and not as many. The only problem I have is that when I order refills all the thermicons don&#x27;t always work. Usually two of them will already be worn out or be close to being worn out. So, I have to let them know and get a replacement order, which is free, but still. That&#x27;s happened 3 times already. Either way, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase even, though, sometimes it&#x27;s not always that easy! It&#x27;s still a great product!</li>
    <li> I can only get this to work in my underarm area and my knees. However I could also use the full size blades on my knees so the only area that I&#x27;m using this for is underarm. No need to use it on my face. Maybe it excels for uses in that area.  The small area kit isn&#x27;t getting near the use that the regular blades are getting so I&#x27;m on the fence about if it&#x27;s necessary for my needs.</li>
    <li> I ordered a NoNo system  from the company  When I received and used it the first time it broke the filaments immediately.  I thought it was an accident or that I had done it,  so I ordered this set from  Amazon.  When I received them they broke also.  I spoke to the company.  When I had originally ordered the system, I ordered one and they sent me two and charged me for both,  So when the first one broke they told me to send it back and keep the unused one.  I have tried to get a refund but have been unable to.  It has cost me around $650 and 7 mos later I still have not gotten refunded for the first one and the second one I have not been able to see any lasting results.  So no, I&#x27;m not pleased  At all by anything with the NoNo brand</li>
    <li> I had ordered from Radiancy and have followed the directions. It worked ok, had to shave afterwords also. Kept using it and it was never fully working. I found out  I was being charge to other payments of 85 dollars on top of my first payment of 135. I thought I  had purchased this kit for 135! Customer service was horrible! I basically got none! No respond to emails. I finally talked to someone over the phone and she would not refund, I could not send my product back. I made it very clear to her that I am very unhappy, I will never buy from them again. I do not show anywhere that they would be charging me additional money! Not that great of product and the worst customer service! WIll NEVER buy from this company! Thanks for stealing my money and not caring about your customers!</li>
    <li> Should be ZERO stars. Purchased from HSN $276.34, used VERY infrequently, died in less than 18 months. No!No! or HSN will not fix or replace due to one year warranty expiration. DO NOT BUY from No! No! or HSN! #NoNocheap #HSNripoff</li>
    <li> I ordered the small area back because I wanted to be able to get the back of my neck right and the tips are the perfect size for me.  I&#x27;ve been able to create a perfectly straight line like at the barber shop.  This thing is great!!</li>
    <li> I have dark blonde hair with a bit of red in it. No!No! didn&#x27;t work for me and then it was a real pain getting a refund. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I ordered this kit I stayed in the description and the image that it came with two buffer pads three thermocon heads and a travel case I only received one small buffer pad and two thermocon tips if I pay for something I want what I ordered and played for off of the description not what the company feels like sending me I will be returning the incomplete kit for a refund I will post how it goes.</li>
    <li> I ordered the No no accessories kit for small areas.  The Amazon website listed that the product was in stock.  The next day I received a confirmatory email saying that my credit card had been charged, but in fact, the product was backordered.  When I called the company to see when it would ship, they were polite, but unfortunately could not ship it in time for me, so I had to cancel the order.  I subsequently went back to the Amazon website to see if I could order it from another company...only to see that the original company is still listing it IN STOCK.  While the company was very cordial when cancelling my order, I think they have an obligation to update their product status on Amazon!</li>
    <li> i used this on my face and it was so much easier to move around than the regular size one.  it takes a little bit longer since you cant get as much hair at a time but it doesnt touch my lips and my nose and i am able to get every little hair!</li>
    <li> Actually the larger pice works better and does not leave strike marks on your chin . Works much much faster</li>
    <li> I had such high hopes for the No!No! product, but it just flat out did not work.  I gave it 6 months hoping it would eventually kick in, but I saw no difference at all.  I&#x27;ve gone back to tweezing.</li>
    <li> This is the ideal gift for your wife or girlfriend. Watch her eyes light up.</li>
    <li> This was very misleading!!  There is No...No way we will buy these products again!!!  Everything way too expensive, nothing comes together!!</li>
    <li> Fit my wife&#x27;s no no perfectly</li>
    <li> I ordered this product thinking that it had the actual hair remover with it.  Now i know it is just a buffer with a nice little zip up package to hold it in.  Waste of money.  The return policy gives you one month to send the small package back.  Not cool.</li>
    <li> I have tried this and it does not work! I followed every single direction to the T and it still did not work. When I tried to send it back they offered no help at all. now I&#x27;m stuck with this and the no!no! all my money wasted because they would not help me. Never gonna buy anything from these people ever again!!</li>
    <li> The case unfortunately, does not seem large ebough to hold the device and its charger. Found a Pelican® Case that fits the bill, better and is better protection.</li>
    <li> Not what i expected different from original pieces doesnt seem to work as well very small  buffers definitly not worth the price</li>
    <li> The tips burnt out crazy fast one of the three didn&#x27;t work at all almost like they were refurbished or something. These thing cost way too much money to not work properly.</li>
    <li> The No No system works, and these added supplies are needed as others are wearing out.  I ike that they came in a case which I can put the whole thing in.</li>
