### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>My hair had literally turned orange from the minerals in our well water, and with the weekly treatments, and shampoo and conditioner, the orange is gone, and my hair feels great!</li>
      <li>AWESOME!  </li>
      <li>I have silvery hair, and this product works wonderfully and smells really nice too !</li>
      <li>and  I am thrilled!  </li>
      <li>This is a good kit for getting gunk and inorganic substances out of your hair.</li>
      <li>Good for color treated hair.</li>
      <li>LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
      <li>Amazing product.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Maybe I will finally be able to grow it out again.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I am pleased with the scalp benefits also.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>(I am still using my favorite all-natural treatments like argan oil, coffee, and honey too.)</li>
      <li>The appearance is better.  </li>
      <li>Love the shampoo and conditioner, wrote another review about that.  </li>
      <li>It is fantastic!  </li>
      <li>My hair is soft, has body again and best of all is blonde again!  </li>
      <li>Just doesn&#x27;t get my hair clean.</li>
      <li>These products made a HUGE difference in my hair after the very first use.</li>
      <li>But when I tried the whole treatment kit my hair turned back to a beautiful gray color.</li>
      <li>I love it so much, when they didn&#x27;t have it anymore and offered to sell me something else, I declined and ordered Malibu online.  </li>
      <li>My hair feels so much better now, actually SOFT!  </li>
      <li>My stylist, who is right about everything, recommended this.</li>
      <li>Wish I could find a healthy shampoo that actually cleaned my hair.</li>
      <li>I tried the shampoo and it worked better than a regular shampoo.</li>
      <li>My hair looks clean and feels natural again.</li>
      <li>This product made my hair feel even more dingy and dry!</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t think anything was going to work but trust me, if you are having this problem</li>
      <li>Highly recommend with two thumbs up!</li>
      <li>Much softer, no brass...</li>
      <li>In the fine print on the packet it warns you not to use it if  you have &amp;#34;non pigmented hair.&amp;#34; When I contacted the company they downplayed this and said I didn&#x27;t have to worry about it unless I was going to use heat with it and as long as  I had &amp;#34;some pigment&amp;#34; in my hair.</li>
      <li>I have fine naturally blond hair that breaks easily with hard water.</li>
      <li>You can feel the difference too--hair feels smooth instead of rough.</li>
      <li>I am hoping that a few more treatments will get all of the orange out and not just fade it.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
      <li>I first purchased it at my local salon.  </li>
      <li>I also use a purple shampoo to help give it an extra boost, but I don&#x27;t think that makes much of a difference.</li>
      <li>So far the Malibu treatment has helped.  </li>
      <li>Do not waste your money or time.</li>
      <li>I wish I could give this 10 stars because it really fixed my hair.</li>
      <li>I was skeptical when I bought this kit, but the price was good</li>
      <li>I found this kit and after 2 uses my hair was back to normal.</li>
      <li>I was really struggling with hard water damaged hair but this helped first treatment/wash!</li>
      <li>Women with white and / or light gray hair beware, if you are after the little packets that treat &amp;#34;yellowing&amp;#34; gray or white hair.</li>
      <li>This is the only thing that worked with my hard well water full of rust!</li>
      <li>Took the hard water build up right out of my hair!</li>

<li> Women with white and / or light gray hair beware, if you are after the little packets that treat &amp;#34;yellowing&amp;#34; gray or white hair.</li>
<li> This is the only thing that worked with my hard well water full of rust!</li>
<li> Took the hard water build up right out of my hair!</li>
<li> for the past few years i&#x27;ve had a lot of dandruff and dry hair (which i figure comes from the dandruff shampoos--and i&#x27;ve tried many brands).  </li>
<li> Worth every penny and as long as I have to use hard water</li>
<li> I had to cut my long hair very short when it started breaking off to short chunks after washing with my well water for about six months.  </li>
<li> At first, I felt like it was working well getting rid of some dryness and brasiness from our hard water.</li>
<li> No more orange tint to my high lights!</li>
<li> /&gt;Still, I definitely reccommend it if you live in a hard water zone like I do.  </li>
<li> DID not make a difference and almost felt like made my hair even more dry and unhappy.</li>
<li> It does tend to dry my hair</li>
<li> It leaves it very soft and manageable; but I gave if 4 stars because my hair had less body than usual with similar cleaning systems; it does what it says and removes everything...</li>
<li> I have lived in the high desert for 10 years now, and have been struggling with unhappy hair the whole time.  </li>
<li> , i&#x27;ve only been using it a few weeks, but so far my hair is softer, less dry and about 90% less dandruff and itching.</li>
<li> The only time my hair hasn&#x27;t felt like straw is when I go away on vacation and wash it elsewhere for a few days.</li>
<li> I live in the mountains on well water that is very hard.</li>
<li> We moved from an area with really soft water to an area with really hard water and my hair knew the difference before the rest of me did!</li>
<li> Well, half was greasy, the other half straw.</li>
<li> I had tried clarifying shampoo&#x27;s and purple tone restoring shampoos with a little benefit.  </li>
<li> However, the other stuff just seems a lot of trouble for very little.</li>
<li> Nothing worked, but I dried my hair out.  </li>
<li> My hair would look greasy as soon as it dried.</li>
<li> I live in Phoenix AZ in with hard water and was not impressed with what this product did for my hair after a few weeks I am throwing in the towel, will not buy again.</li>
<li> I moved into a house with really hard well water and after a few showers it turned my naturally veryy blonde hair a horrible orange/brown color.</li>
<li> My naturally blonde hair with highlights had turned an ugly dull brownish orange with brassy tones due to the iron our well water.  </li>
<li> I have used this product once, along with the hard water treatment and conditioner</li>
<li> I was horrified and searched all over for a product that would remove the hard water stains and keep my hair protected from it happening again.</li>
<li> Keeps the hard water/rust from re-depositing on your hair.</li>
<li> Our well has hard water with a lot of iron in it.</li>
<li> We have hard water and no water softener.  </li>
<li> We have extremely hard water, if you were to fill a glass from the tap it would be a orange-ish brown-ish color.</li>
<li> I complained to amazon and they refunded me without requiring return</li>
<li> Hard water you don&#x27;t understand!</li>
<li> We just moved and the water is terribly hard!  </li>
<li> I have tried everything to get rid of this horrible orange color in my hair, even straight peroxide.  </li>
<li> But, it ended up drying my scalp out terribly.</li>
<li> Awful!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Amazing product. I was really struggling with hard water damaged hair but this helped first treatment/wash! Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Just doesn&#x27;t get my hair clean. My hair would look greasy as soon as it dried. Well, half was greasy, the other half straw. When I went road tripping with a friend, she tried it and said the same. Wish I could find a healthy shampoo that actually cleaned my hair. Sigh.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I first purchased it at my local salon.  I love it so much, when they didn&#x27;t have it anymore and offered to sell me something else, I declined and ordered Malibu online.  I have silvery hair, and this product works wonderfully and smells really nice too !</li>
    <li> My naturally blonde hair with highlights had turned an ugly dull brownish orange with brassy tones due to the iron our well water.  I had tried clarifying shampoo&#x27;s and purple tone restoring shampoos with a little benefit.  I have used this product once, along with the hard water treatment and conditioner and  I am thrilled!  My hair is soft, has body again and best of all is blonde again!  It is fantastic!  Highly recommend with two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo and conditioner, wrote another review about that.  However, the other stuff just seems a lot of trouble for very little.</li>
    <li> Our well has hard water with a lot of iron in it. My hair is gray. If I don&#x27;t use this product my hair gets an orange tint. One of the local women told me about Malibu. I tried the shampoo and it worked better than a regular shampoo. But when I tried the whole treatment kit my hair turned back to a beautiful gray color. It does tend to dry my hair so I have to use lots of conditioner which comes with the kit. I only need to use the Malibu kit occasionally. The rest of the time I use my regular shampoo. Love this product.</li>
    <li> My hair had literally turned orange from the minerals in our well water, and with the weekly treatments, and shampoo and conditioner, the orange is gone, and my hair feels great!</li>
    <li> I did not believe this would remove chemicals from my hair, but it does! I can wash my hair every 2-3 days now, instead of every day!!!</li>
    <li> We have extremely hard water, if you were to fill a glass from the tap it would be a orange-ish brown-ish color. You can only imagine what that would do to your hair. After using this product one time with the demineralizer packets my hair is blonde again! I also use a purple shampoo to help give it an extra boost, but I don&#x27;t think that makes much of a difference. I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> This is a good kit for getting gunk and inorganic substances out of your hair. It leaves it very soft and manageable; but I gave if 4 stars because my hair had less body than usual with similar cleaning systems; it does what it says and removes everything...&lt;br /&gt;Still, I definitely reccommend it if you live in a hard water zone like I do.  Once or twice month should keep your locks &amp;#34;Goldie&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> my hairdresser suggested this after hearing my complaints.  for the past few years i&#x27;ve had a lot of dandruff and dry hair (which i figure comes from the dandruff shampoos--and i&#x27;ve tried many brands).  i rate this product a 4 for now, i&#x27;ve only been using it a few weeks, but so far my hair is softer, less dry and about 90% less dandruff and itching.</li>
    <li> I live in Phoenix AZ in with hard water and was not impressed with what this product did for my hair after a few weeks I am throwing in the towel, will not buy again.</li>
    <li> A necessity if you have well water. I can&#x27;t live without it. Otherwise my hair will turn orange when mixed with ocean water.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that worked with my hard well water full of rust! My hair looks clean and feels natural again.</li>
    <li> I have lived in the high desert for 10 years now, and have been struggling with unhappy hair the whole time.  I had to cut my long hair very short when it started breaking off to short chunks after washing with my well water for about six months.  Awful!  Since then, I have tried to be diligent in rinsing with bottled water--what a pain!--and I have tried all kinds of hair products, both store-bought and homemade, in vain.  The only time my hair hasn&#x27;t felt like straw is when I go away on vacation and wash it elsewhere for a few days. I was skeptical when I bought this kit, but the price was good so I took a chance.  Yay!  My hair feels so much better now, actually SOFT!  Maybe I will finally be able to grow it out again.  (I am still using my favorite all-natural treatments like argan oil, coffee, and honey too.)</li>
    <li> These products deliver shiny, manageable hair! I am pleased with the scalp benefits also.  Good for color treated hair.</li>
    <li> shampoo works well but I didn&#x27;t care for the conditioner not moisturizing enough for me</li>
    <li> NO. NO. OHHHH NO. Do not waste your money or time. This product made my hair feel even more dingy and dry! I live in the mountains on well water that is very hard. DID not make a difference and almost felt like made my hair even more dry and unhappy. Malibu stick to surfing and sun. Hard water you don&#x27;t understand!</li>
    <li> We moved from an area with really soft water to an area with really hard water and my hair knew the difference before the rest of me did! These products made a HUGE difference in my hair after the very first use. Much softer, no brass...the hair I had before moving here!</li>
    <li> AWESOME!  Took the hard water build up right out of my hair!</li>
    <li> No more orange tint to my high lights! You can feel the difference too--hair feels smooth instead of rough. Keeps the hard water/rust from re-depositing on your hair. Even the hubby doesn&#x27;t mind the Orange Cream-sickle smell &amp; uses it.&lt;br /&gt;Note---start using after a Malibu Treatment so you&#x27;re starting with a &amp;#34;clean slate&amp;#34; to keep hair that way.</li>
    <li> We just moved and the water is terribly hard!  Malibu was recommended by a lot of people and definitely helps!</li>
    <li> I have tried everything to get rid of this horrible orange color in my hair, even straight peroxide.  Nothing worked, but I dried my hair out.  So far the Malibu treatment has helped.  I am hoping that a few more treatments will get all of the orange out and not just fade it.</li>
    <li> Women with white and / or light gray hair beware, if you are after the little packets that treat &amp;#34;yellowing&amp;#34; gray or white hair. In the fine print on the packet it warns you not to use it if  you have &amp;#34;non pigmented hair.&amp;#34; When I contacted the company they downplayed this and said I didn&#x27;t have to worry about it unless I was going to use heat with it and as long as  I had &amp;#34;some pigment&amp;#34; in my hair. I tried the packets and neither made any difference in they yellowing my white hair has been getting. I complained to amazon and they refunded me without requiring return but I won&#x27;t be buy it again.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS STUFF! I have fine naturally blond hair that breaks easily with hard water. This stuff saves my hair!</li>
    <li> My stylist, who is right about everything, recommended this. At first, I felt like it was working well getting rid of some dryness and brasiness from our hard water. But, it ended up drying my scalp out terribly. I may hold onto it for a weekly treatment but can&#x27;t recommend for daily use.</li>
    <li> We have hard water and no water softener.  My brown hair was always orange from the iron in the water. I used this once a week.  The appearance is better.  I also installed a Sante Health Filter on the shower head that is supposed to act as a water softener.  I just had a chlorine filter on the shower head before and my hair is softer and shinier now because of both the Malibu and Sante Health Filter products.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this 10 stars because it really fixed my hair. I moved into a house with really hard well water and after a few showers it turned my naturally veryy blonde hair a horrible orange/brown color. I was horrified and searched all over for a product that would remove the hard water stains and keep my hair protected from it happening again. I found this kit and after 2 uses my hair was back to normal. I really didn&#x27;t think anything was going to work but trust me, if you are having this problem this kit will amaze you. Worth every penny and as long as I have to use hard water I will have this kit on hand.</li>
