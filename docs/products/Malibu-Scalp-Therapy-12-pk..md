      <li>I first tried this product at my hair salon and fell in love.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t work for my needs, not a bad product.  </li>
      <li>It leaves your hair in nice condition rather than dry it out like most dandruff shampoos do.&lt;br</li>
      <li>But I did notice a big difference the next week and was impressed with it&#x27;s results.  </li>
      <li>Super stuff for psoriasis.  </li>
      <li>THIS DID AFTER THE FIRST TIME!</li>

      <li>First treatment removed all of the scabs from my head.</li>
      <li>I love the same Malibu product:</li>
      <li>This worked the first try.  </li>
      <li>This changed the life and saved us so much money for my husband!</li>
      <li>That is why I put it on first and let it sit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Product arrived in a timely manner and was a positive customer experience.</li>
      <li>This is a cream and easy to use in the shower like a regular conditioner.</li>
      <li>T-gel and dandruff shampoos, gentle shampoos, moisturizing shampoos never gave him relief</li>
      <li>The price was also very affordable.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.  </li>
      <li>I live in New England and the winter months really bother my scalp, but not anymore!</li>
      <li>recommended by my stylist, i have fine blonde hair that i have professionally bleached.</li>
      <li>Have been using for 2-3 months and highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>this is the only product i have found without damaging my hair, and it really helps a lot!</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t stop new growth but it would clear what was there.</li>
      <li>My hair never felt so soft and the dandruff stopped completely.</li>
      <li>I paid nearly 5dollars for one packet at the salon.</li>
      <li>CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]]  </li>
      <li>Nothing helped for long or cleared my scalp completely.</li>

<li> CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]]  </li>
<li> Nothing helped for long or cleared my scalp completely.</li>
<li> So, if you plan to use it in the shower that is rather a long time to let just sit there.  </li>
<li> That is how long it says to leave on scalp.  </li>
<li> My husband does not have dandruff, psoriasis or chronic dry scalp</li>
<li> Like steroids, this seems to reduce plaque size on scalps a little bit, but very temporarily for at least one person who tried it.&lt;br</li>
<li> I find that extreme but to save sanity</li>
<li> I will keep looking on to other product types.</li>
<li> I had a very severe case of contact dermatitis on my scalp with huge amounts of flaking at hairline and terrible itching.  </li>
<li> Calms it down and keeps it from itching.  </li>
<li> I use it at least once a week</li>
<li> With one treatment no more flakes!  </li>
<li> Lately it was really bad and doctor didn&#x27;t know anything else to try.</li>
<li> I get just two small dime size spots that drive me insane.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this 12 pack of scalp therapy.  I use it at least once a week and it definitely calms my scalp psoriasis.  I definitely will purchase again and again!</li>
    <li> Great product. Scalp feels so much better after one use.  I highly recommend this product. I plan to buy shampoo and conditioner soon.</li>
    <li> Thank goodness for this product!!  Yes it works. If you have eczema or psoriasis on your scalp at all this is the product! I get just two small dime size spots that drive me insane. I have gotten steroid shots for it even.  I find that extreme but to save sanity we do what we have to do.  This worked the first try.  It keeps it at bay for weeks.&lt;br /&gt;It is a powder that you add water to. The instructions say to pour it in your hand and sprinkle water and rub it where needed. I actually put some in a dish, add water and use a brush, then come it though after 7 minutes. That is how long it says to leave on scalp.  So, if you plan to use it in the shower that is rather a long time to let just sit there.  That is why I put it on first and let it sit.&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend the shampoo scalp brush. LOVE this thing!! [[ASIN:B000NJG82W Scalpmaster Shampoo Brush]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For shampoo and conditioner that I found best so far: [[ASIN:B007JT7AIK CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]]  There is a matching conditioner too.  It leaves your hair in nice condition rather than dry it out like most dandruff shampoos do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For good conditioner I love the same Malibu product: [[ASIN:B002IY2EBY Malibu C Miracle Repair Power Protein Builder - 12 Packets]]  This is a cream and easy to use in the shower like a regular conditioner. Amazing results!  I might add that the scalp therapy leaves your hair in very nice condition too!!</li>
    <li> I had a very severe case of contact dermatitis on my scalp with huge amounts of flaking at hairline and terrible itching.  The Malibu Scalp Therapy worked wonders!  I love this product!</li>
    <li> Works great as a more natural way to get rid of plaque build up. I had to use it several times a week. It didn&#x27;t stop new growth but it would clear what was there.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my needs, not a bad product.  I will keep looking on to other product types. Oh, well.</li>
    <li> Like steroids, this seems to reduce plaque size on scalps a little bit, but very temporarily for at least one person who tried it.&lt;br /&gt;It also stung the scalp a bit for that person whereas steroids did not. Just fyi. Bought it for a friend.</li>
    <li> Product arrived in a timely manner and was a positive customer experience.</li>
    <li> My husband does not have dandruff, psoriasis or chronic dry scalp but he does have an occasional itchy scalp that flakes. T-gel and dandruff shampoos, gentle shampoos, moisturizing shampoos never gave him relief but this product is amazing! He uses 1x per week and can&#x27;t say enough how helpful this product is. Will continue to buy and recommend.</li>
    <li> Stopped my head from itching immediately.  Much better than the medicated shampoo prescribed by my dermatologist that totally dried out my hair and removed most of my hair color!  Malibu scalp therapy did not affect my hair color at all.</li>
    <li> i was dissapointed that this prcduct didn&#x27;t help</li>
    <li> I first tried this product at my hair salon and fell in love. Buying it on amazon I saved a ton of money. I paid nearly 5dollars for one packet at the salon. I live in New England and the winter months really bother my scalp, but not anymore! Love the way this works and I use it once a week!</li>
    <li> Super stuff for psoriasis.  Calms it down and keeps it from itching.  Almost cures it.</li>
    <li> This changed the life and saved us so much money for my husband! Hes had scalp issues for 10 years everything we have done and seen the doctor for everything nothing ever worked! THIS DID AFTER THE FIRST TIME! all flakes are gone and have stayed gone!!!!</li>
    <li> recommended by my stylist, i have fine blonde hair that i have professionally bleached. this is the only product i have found without damaging my hair, and it really helps a lot!</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  Does what it says it does and very easy to apply.  The price was also very affordable.</li>
    <li> It was not at all what I&#x27;ve ever used before so it was interesting to use.  But I did notice a big difference the next week and was impressed with it&#x27;s results.  So far I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I have had eczema on my scalp for 20 years. I have been to multiple doctors and tried several prescription drugs. Nothing helped for long or cleared my scalp completely. Lately it was really bad and doctor didn&#x27;t know anything else to try. I found the Malibu Scalp Treatment and figured I had nothing to lose, except $20. I have been SO please. First treatment removed all of the scabs from my head. Have been using for 2-3 months and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I had flakes that would fly out when I messed with my hair!  With one treatment no more flakes!  WAHOO</li>
    <li> Great products. Works wonderful</li>
    <li> Great product and great transaction. My hair never felt so soft and the dandruff stopped completely. I love this and recommended it to all of my family.</li>
