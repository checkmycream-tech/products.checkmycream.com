      <li>Haven&#x27;t seen any positive results yet.</li>
      <li>But like I said she is using a pure body naturals vitamin c serum for face also</li>
      <li>I got this product a few days back tried it out and was beyond happy.</li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.  </li>
      <li>Does absolutely nothing.</li>
      <li>I also had a bit of crepe-y skin between my eyebrows that is much smoother now.</li>

      <li>Maybe if I had of started with less pressure, I would have had a better experience.</li>
      <li>It rolls smoothly and is small enough to get around most of my under eye area.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I have has fraxel treatments before and this is doing the exact same thing without the high cost!</li>
      <li>to sterilize with alcohol or soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;Has a clear covered case to store it in.</li>
      <li>Within 2 weeks, it is considerably lighter.</li>
      <li>I felt I could not use it again until my skin healed up completely.</li>
      <li>but I do believe it is slowly making a difference in my skin :)</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t say what is right or wrong, but the directions for sure do not say to do that.</li>
      <li>But the next day it will be back to normal.</li>

<li> But the next day it will be back to normal.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m now on my 2nd treatment and the ones on the right side of my stomach are almost completely gone and the left side aren&#x27;t far behind!</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have the fluid to use with it and the only reason I&#x27;m not giving a 5 star is because I haven&#x27;t had it long enough nor do I have the liquid.</li>
<li> you are finished I suggest using a small spray bottle, and pour alcohol into it, Spray the roller, (needles) and gently place back into its cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;BE</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t be scared of it, go slow at first if you need to.</li>
<li> when you have completed the downward direction, you roll a little bit to the side, then after that, you roll completely sideways.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
<li> For those who say it hurts way too much, you&#x27;re probably just pressing too hard.</li>
<li> The darker ones have lightened a lot in color, but are not completely gone yet.</li>
<li> But you roll in one direction down starting by your ear, 10 strokes, move over and repeat to the next section of your face.</li>
<li> Use it every 4 weeks so skin can heal properly and daily use of a moisturizer on them and in no time they&#x27;ll be gone or less visible.</li>
<li> i have tried 3 other rollers prior to this one</li>
<li> It&#x27;s also inexpensive especially compared to some of the other products out there.</li>
<li> After 3rd use pain is less...</li>
<li> This particular derma roller is on the small side, but I am only using it for a small targeted area</li>
<li> It did leave my skin with lots of little holes that scabbed over, and left roughened patches of skin in some areas, so maybe I used it too enthusiastically?</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good quality, just would like to have a case for it.</li>
    <li> I used it on a dark spot on my check. Within 2 weeks, it is considerably lighter. I was a little worries because I have darker skin to begin with but it worked out great. I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> Great Quality for such little money! Great results after just two applications. . .</li>
    <li> Truly is the poor mans fraxel!  I have has fraxel treatments before and this is doing the exact same thing without the high cost!</li>
    <li> Well made item.  If you want to try Micro needling then no worries this item is fine.  I have both the 1.0mm and the 1.5mm-both work fine on my face. I use this maybe once or twice a month. I have not tried them with a topical anesthetic-I just press hard enough to feel heat and see redness.  Afterwards, I put on my usual serums and moisturizers.  The redness disappears in minutes and the next morning my skin is even toned, smooth and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> I used this item without the using numbing cream and it wasn&#x27;t as painful as I thought it would be. After using the roller and applying serum to my face I went to bed. The results in the morning were great! I&#x27;m so glad I saw someone use this on YouTube.</li>
    <li> works as good as more expensive rollers. can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I am currently using this product to help reduce the sight of my bright red stretch marks on my stomach. This particular derma roller is on the small side, but I am only using it for a small targeted area so it&#x27;s perfect for that. If you plan to use it on larger areas I would suggest a larger sized head. (Not necessarily larger needle size) I derma roll over my skin once a week in a couple different directions and I have seen AMAZING results so far. After using the derma roller I follow up with Acure Organics Lemongrass + Moroccan Argan Oil Firming Body Lotion, and use this product on my stomach every morning and night. I&#x27;ve used it 3-4 times already and the stretch marks that were lighter in color are almost gone. The darker ones have lightened a lot in color, but are not completely gone yet. I plan to keep using it once a week until they are gone, but so far I am very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> i LOVE these. they arent lying when they say they are great for fine lines and stretch marks.</li>
    <li> Great product! Works well! Good quality!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not too sure about continuing using this tool for myself. It does HURT!&lt;br /&gt;I read the other reviews and tried to follow the directions, but for me, it just hurt too badly for me to continue using it. I&#x27;m going to give it another go, to give it a chance, but I will use it with much less pressure. It did leave my skin with lots of little holes that scabbed over, and left roughened patches of skin in some areas, so maybe I used it too enthusiastically? I felt I could not use it again until my skin healed up completely. DO READ the other reviews and follow the instructions, and start out slowly. Maybe if I had of started with less pressure, I would have had a better experience. I&#x27;m all for doing things for maintaining skin, but I&#x27;m not sure if this is for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is quality made with very very very sharp little bed of needles on the wheel.&lt;br /&gt;Nicely designed handle for grip and ease of using the tool.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to sterilize with alcohol or soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;Has a clear covered case to store it in. Well made case.&lt;br /&gt;As was recommended, I did use a Vitamin C serum after treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know others said it worked well for them. I don&#x27;t know if I would recommend this skin tool to others. The price is reasonable. If my experience changes with the next go-round, I will update my review. I always update ALL of my reviews. If you don&#x27;t see an update, then product remains the same.</li>
    <li> A affordable alternative to laser surgery! This improved my deep acne scars.</li>
    <li> It really works.seeing results with my stretch marks and brown spots on my face.</li>
    <li> This does nothing. It is a waste of money</li>
    <li> I use it twice a month, along with vitamin C serum and it has made the results from these drum show faster. My acne scars , which are very few are starting to fade little by little. Before purchasing this I made sure to watch a lot of youtube videos on derma rollers to be sure on how to use them correctly and what the &amp;#34;Shelf life&amp;#34; of these is (around 8 uses, you don;t want to have blunt needles prickling at your skin), so I bought two at once. The shipping from this supplier was very fast and he product is exactly as advertised: It comes with instructions for use (still do look for those youtube videos) and a nice hardshell clear plastic box to store it.</li>
    <li> I got this product a few days back tried it out and was beyond happy. I had scars on my arm from when I was a kid from using this once I already noticed a good differences 😊.</li>
    <li> Works as good as the $60.00 one they try to sell at the Beauty stores. I have one in 3 sizes and I am amazed these really work. I didn&#x27;t believe they did or would or even how they could. But, they do and thank you for selling them to us all.&lt;br /&gt;Just clean your face really well.&lt;br /&gt;They should send you a link on how to roll your face. But you roll in one direction down starting by your ear, 10 strokes, move over and repeat to the next section of your face. when you have completed the downward direction, you roll a little bit to the side, then after that, you roll completely sideways.&lt;br /&gt;When you are finished I suggest using a small spray bottle, and pour alcohol into it, Spray the roller, (needles) and gently place back into its cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;BE SURE TO IMMEDIATLEY  put Hyaluronic Acid with Vitamin C sold here at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Your face will be real red, like a sunburn. But the next day it will be back to normal. It kind of burns, but not bad.&lt;br /&gt;Also, don&#x27;t press too hard on the roller, but be firm. You usually won&#x27;t draw blood, believe it or not, but it is not unusual if you do.  Don&#x27;t be scared of it, go slow at first if you need to. But also don&#x27;t go crazy either. I have seen videos where people put numbing cream on and really get down.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say what is right or wrong, but the directions for sure do not say to do that. :)  So I hope you stat looking great in no time, Good luck!</li>
    <li> Only 2 uses and alread seeing great results, Definitely recommend</li>
    <li> Meets my needs very well!  Am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Okay so my mom has been using hundreds of products trying to get rid of her dark patches on her face, never did she find any to make them go away. She did however use the &amp;#34;pure body naturals vitamin c serum for face&amp;#34;along with this product. She has 2 dark patches on each cheek and also has dark circles. It hasn&#x27;t even been a month yet and they&#x27;re already fading ! She has been getting so many compliments about how her skin is looking toned and her marks fading. its been about 3 weeks and the results are already showing and she will be purchasing the .5 for her eyes also. But like I said she is using a pure body naturals vitamin c serum for face also so I do recommend them both together:)</li>
    <li> I have spent over $400 in stretch mark creams that did NOTHING for me. In using this ONE time my stretch marks reduced by over half!! I&#x27;m now on my 2nd treatment and the ones on the right side of my stomach are almost completely gone and the left side aren&#x27;t far behind! Shipping I upgraded to 3 day and it was here in 2! Love this seller and this product!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to use it for a full month but so far I am pleased.  I wish I had different sizes and widths!! I don&#x27;t have the fluid to use with it and the only reason I&#x27;m not giving a 5 star is because I haven&#x27;t had it long enough nor do I have the liquid. When I get the rest of product ordered and able to use it I may be definitely giving a 5 star! !!! But I love it!!</li>
    <li> Great! Fast shipping. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have only used it twice however i have noticed a diffrence in my skin texture and fading of hyperpigmentaions and a few dark acne scars.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and good results in a very short time. I bought another! Remember to replace it about every few months.</li>
    <li> i have tried 3 other rollers prior to this one and i would have to say that the item is superior to the other 3 i purchased , it was packaged cleaner , and i got better results in the first use . As i roll though the needles dull which is to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;took about 4 weeks to get that is the downside.</li>
    <li> Useless. Does absolutely nothing.</li>
    <li> Difference on face after first use (texture). Yes, hurts but is bearable. After 3rd use pain is less...</li>
    <li> Came over half broken .  Cheap.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m getting great results</li>
    <li> Nice and easy to handle and use&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it for you</li>
    <li> The sterile sac it came in was open when I received it.</li>
    <li> Really enjoying this product. I had never used a derma roller. I ordered it in the 1.5mm and I think it&#x27;s perfect for me. I have had several procedures before such as laser hair removal, IPL facials and chemical peels so I feel I have a moderate pain tolerance. I was able to use this the first time without anesthetic but only very gently. The second time I used a 4% lidocaine gel I purchased here on Amazon and I feel I really was able to use this to its max potential. It rolls smoothly and is small enough to get around most of my under eye area. It comes with a nice little storage case and arrived super fast. I would definitely repurchase this item again.</li>
    <li> Horrible.  Made my glands revolt.  Something in the metal that gives me a vicious reaction.  For days after my body is rejecting whatever has been encountered through this monster.</li>
    <li> I do experience some slight discomfort with this roller.  Nothing terribly painful however I have never used one before, so I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.  I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times, so I honestly could not tell you whether or not this product is helping my skin.  I will continue to use it.  However, this roller feels sturdy and well made.  I do feel like this was a good item to experiment with as it was quite inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Well made. Works nice and am starting to see results  already.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any positive results yet. My skin looks no better.</li>
    <li> I have been using this a couple of times a week for about 3 weeks now. I notice that products absorb better into my skin when I use it and the products seem to be more effective. I also had a bit of crepe-y skin between my eyebrows that is much smoother now. The lines on my forehead don&#x27;t seem changed but the fine smile lines around my mouth are much less noticeable.</li>
    <li> Miracle product.  This has dramatically improved my stretch marks and a bad acne spot on my face.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Been using it off and on for one side of my shoulders where I have stretch marks.  I&#x27;m noticing a bit of a difference.  It isn&#x27;t awful pain to use, but some more sensitive parts can be pretty tough!  Will update once I have more definitive results.</li>
    <li> No magic product but I do believe it is slowly making a difference in my skin :)</li>
    <li> I ordered the 1.5 and got the 0.5. Not appropriate for area I&#x27;m using it for.</li>
    <li> This derma roller is a good fit and good length, works well for face or any part of body.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in skin. I have been using it for 2 months now.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s of good quality and effective. It&#x27;s also inexpensive especially compared to some of the other products out there. It does hurt though. It&#x27;s not unbearable or anything but there is some definite discomfort. Keep in mind your are rolling needles across your face. So some pain is expected. For those who say it hurts way too much, you&#x27;re probably just pressing too hard. Ultimately it does work. I use it before bed 2 or 3 times a week and my skin feels awesome the next day.</li>
    <li> people have noticed a difference. If anything at least it stimulates blood circulation &amp; helps my serum to be absorbed.</li>
    <li> It broke after the second try and I got bumps after</li>
    <li> Using for pregnancy related stretch marks and it works wonders. Use it every 4 weeks so skin can heal properly and daily use of a moisturizer on them and in no time they&#x27;ll be gone or less visible.</li>
    <li> Out of all the rollers I could have picked I got the best one for me..</li>
    <li> Great I see improvements on my skin and on my stretch marks only after using a couple times</li>
    <li> yep, it works great and good quality</li>
</ol>
