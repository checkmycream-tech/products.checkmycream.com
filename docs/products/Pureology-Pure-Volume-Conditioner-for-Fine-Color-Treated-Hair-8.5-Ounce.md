<ol>
      <li>So happy that Amazon carries it!</li>
      <li>Great price!</li>
      <li>Still the best on the market.  </li>
      <li>And, I am especially pleased because it is listed with PETA as a product that does not test on animals (although it does not have the &amp;#34;bunny&amp;#34; symbol for being against animal cruelty/testing.  </li>
      <li>Best that I have found yet.</li>
      <li>great product for color treated hair.  </li>
      <li>And they look great.</li>
      <li>I had heard that pureology made great hair products.</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant scent that isn&#x27;t over-powering.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve loved these products for years as I have fine hair and the products are perfect for that.</li>
      <li>It smells good and not too flowery.</li>
      <li>This size is good for travel</li>
      <li>So happy to know Amazon had it on hand and love the convenience of ordering.  </li>
      <li>Pureology is a great hair product that is eco friendly and my hair loves it!</li>
      <li>Servvice was great &amp; Pureology products readily available at a good price.</li>
      <li>I have noticed a lot more volume as well!  </li>
      <li>Will buy again that is for sure!</li>
      <li>This is the exact definition of my hair type, and the conditioner is wonderful.  </li>
      <li>I love the Purelogy Volume products!</li>
      <li>whole Pureology line is great!</li>
      <li>This stuff is so good for my fine color treated hair.</li>
      <li>I will keep alternating with another conditioner i have when I feel I need a more hydrating conditioner.</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>Love them.....</li>
      <li>I have used it for many years for my color treated hair.  </li>
      <li>Keeps it healthy and shiny and easy to manage.</li>
      <li>good for it also...leaves it healthy and can use everyday...</li>
      <li>works very well on my fine thinning hair....</li>
      <li>While it worked better than some conditioners I have used, I have gotten the same results with Pantene conditioner at a quarter of the cost.</li>
      <li>I feel that this is a good conditioner, but for the price I have also found a few other ones that I feel actually do a better job for my hair type.  </li>
      <li>Easy way to shop for items I use daily.</li>
      <li>Quality non toxic conditioner and great for thin hair.</li>
      <li>And I really like them....</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s not the real thing</li>
      <li>While it did make my hair fluffier, it also left static in my hair, and the short hairs on my part-line stood up straight.  </li>
      <li>As long as it&#x27;s animal friendly, I will continue to use it.</li>
      <li>Even though this was much more expensive than the conditioner I had been buying at Costco, I decided to try it because it was on an online list of highly rated conditioners for fine, color-treated hair.  </li>
      <li>It makes my hair so soft!  </li>
      <li>I tried this conditioner because it came highly recommended for fine thin hair.  </li>

<li> product that I&#x27;ve used in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It was only average in preventing snarls.</li>
<li> I get no volume in my fine hair and it is dirty within two days.</li>
<li> It gives my thin hair a lot of bounce.</li>
<li> so thin hair needs a lightweight shampoo and conditioner for volume and this, paired with the shampoo is FANTASIC.</li>

    <li> Best that I have found yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and I love it.  It does what it says - adds volume.  It has a pleasant scent that isn&#x27;t over-powering.  I also use the shampoo.  And, I am especially pleased because it is listed with PETA as a product that does not test on animals (although it does not have the &amp;#34;bunny&amp;#34; symbol for being against animal cruelty/testing.

    <li> This size is good for travel and I&#x27;ll soon be getting the big shower size.  I&#x27;ve loved these products for years as I have fine hair and the products are perfect for that.</li>
    <li> Have used this shampoo and conditioner before and like the smell and the way my hair feels after.  So happy to know Amazon had it on hand and love the convenience of ordering.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I feel that this is a good conditioner, but for the price I have also found a few other ones that I feel actually do a better job for my hair type.  I will keep alternating with another conditioner i have when I feel I need a more hydrating conditioner.</li>
    <li> This is the exact definition of my hair type, and the conditioner is wonderful.  I will say the picture was a bit misleading, I thought the bottle would be bigger.  But, no worries, I&#x27;ll be back!</li>
