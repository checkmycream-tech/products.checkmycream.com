      <li>Powerful protector.</li>
      <li>And believe me, my life has been no less stressful - more so if anything.</li>

      <li>In any case, if you intend to put this on your skin or lips I would think twice because if it did contain other oils they might not be good for your skin or ingestion or even for inhaling.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t be put off by the bottle size, it really is a great quality oil and a small amount</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use full strength on skin as I said before it is VERY concentrated.</li>
      <li>Great product, compares well to much more expensive brands.  </li>

      <li>They are SO pure and strong, and energetically you feel yourself open right up.</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t say whether this is pure melissa oil and nothing else.  </li>
      <li>but you really don&#x27;t have to use alot.</li>

      <li>yes, this had been medically confirmed as HSV early on when the sored almost completely covered the roof of my mouth).</li>
      <li>Yes, this tiny bottle lasted me a whole year!!!</li>
      <li>to those who may have more sensitive skin than I, Melissa can be diluted in a carrier oil (like Hazelnut or Rosehip Seed oil) down to 10% or less of the total concentration and still be just as effective - taking any essential oil orally, and undiluted certainly, should be done with caution - pay attention to your own reaction and proceed accordingly.</li>

      <li>I tried some natural routes; Lysine - an amino acid - seemed to help, but not all the time, and not unless I took it (and a LOT of it) before the outbreaks would occur.</li>

      <li>use it directly on the skin, because it will burn like hell.  </li>
      <li>Worked first time I used it, but seemed to loose its effectiveness.</li>
      <li>even though it&#x27;s a small bottle, It should last me awhile for sure.</li>
      <li>But I did feel that the Melissa oil helped, too, in that I felt the prodrome stop more quickly than I would have with just the aspirin and cold sore machine without the addition of the oil.</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;m happy to say, the cold sores haven&#x27;t even tried to come back.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I read the review that said that Melissa oil can kill off herpes once and for all. I usually use Young Living Oils, but Melissa is gawdawful expensive through YL, so after reading the reviews of this product, I thought I would give it a try instead. I made my own blend of argan oil and this oil after I got it (10:1). Then I stuffed myself on coconut and chocolate, which is fun but is also a sure fire way for me to provoke a cold sore. When I felt the prodrome (that tingling feeling that is the harbinger of a cold sore), I used the blend on that spot. In fairness, I also took aspirin, which if taken early can stop a cold sore from forming, (you can also crush it wet it and apply it as a paste on the cold sore, the salicylate in it will stop the viral replication) and I used my Virulite cold sore machine on that spot, too. I have found the combo of the aspirin and use of the cold sore machine will stop a cold sore from forming, and in fact I did not get a cold sore. But I did feel that the Melissa oil helped, too, in that I felt the prodrome stop more quickly than I would have with just the aspirin and cold sore machine without the addition of the oil. It is my hope, too, that by use of the Melissa oil blend that I have killed off the herpes virus at that site entirely. We will see. I will post updates.</li>
    <li> Great oil for the price!</li>
    <li> Very potent and fragrant - a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> I used just a couple drops of this as directed and people in the house immediately opened all the windows complaining of a very strong chemical smell.  Indeed it does have a very strong citronella-like smell to it that reminded more some cleaning product fragrance.  As I understand it pure melissa oil is very expensive.  Wikipedia says lemon balm oil is commonly codistilled with citronella oil or other oils.  I&#x27;m not a chemist so I can&#x27;t say whether this is pure melissa oil and nothing else.  However there was something else about this product that makes me a little suspicious.  In any case, if you intend to put this on your skin or lips I would think twice because if it did contain other oils they might not be good for your skin or ingestion or even for inhaling.  You might be better off using an ingestible extract of Lemon Balm on your skin.  Regarding the aroma, I found no benefit, calming or otherwise.  In fact the strong smell of even a couple drops was unpleasant and distracting.</li>
    <li> The Herpes Simplex virus (or HSV) is a difficult disease. It is widely known as incurable, with painful skin lesions on sensitive areas of the body. The lesions reccur more often for some people than others - their &#x27;outbreaks&#x27; tend to be related to periods of high-stress. Modern medicine does not offer a cure, though there are pharmaceutical preparations available to limit the frequency and duration of HSV outbreaks. With a reputation as &#x27;incurable&#x27;, &#x27;painful&#x27;, &#x27;not-so-pretty&#x27;, and varieties described as &#x27;oral and labial&#x27; or &#x27;genital&#x27;, the disease can be a little challenging and embarrasing to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;ve been through this. I&#x27;ve had the painful lesions, had to deal with the regular outbreaks of painful cold-sores in my mouth and on my lips (I was blessed with the &#x27;oral&#x27; variety). I&#x27;ve been through those great internal debates on how to break the news to a partner (thankfully always returning that look that says something like &#x27;Oh! I thought you were going to tell me my cat just died...that&#x27;s no big deal&#x27;). Though it still seemed like a big deal. Regularly having those few days of feeling like a flu was coming on, followed by a few days of outbreak - at what always seemed like the worst of times. On top of it, being an athlete, training really hard tended to cause outbreaks as well - weightlifting in particular. Maybe it was just really strenuous, or maybe I wasn&#x27;t actually a &#x27;weightlifter&#x27; - but that heavy lifting would almost always lead, once again, to an outbreak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I have to go through this forever? Would I always be taking prescription drugs to keep the virus at bay? I tried some natural routes; Lysine - an amino acid - seemed to help, but not all the time, and not unless I took it (and a LOT of it) before the outbreaks would occur. I used significant amounts of lip balm, as sun overexposure would again bring it on. I have a lot of years left! Will this always be a factor in my life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then it so happened I got involved in essential oils - the powerful aromatic compounds distilled in small amounts from plants. You&#x27;ve probably heard of them - Lavender oil, Sandalwood, Frankincense, etc. They&#x27;re getting to be fairly common these days. And then one day I stumbled onto research being performed with a particularly rare essential oil called &#x27;Melissa&#x27; or &#x27;Lemon Balm&#x27;. Melissa is steam distilled from the leaves of the Melissa herb - and in very small quanitities. The plant yields a small amount of oil relative to all the other aromatic plant species out there. Research has been being performed in Europe for several years applying Melissa oil to herpes outbreaks, with very interesting results. In fact, one German pharmaceutical company extracted the &#x27;active&#x27; component of the oil and sold it in a prescription preparation for use by herpes &#x27;sufferers&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most encouraging statement regarding the use of Melissa on herpes was made by Dr. Dietrich Wabner, a professor at the University of Munich: he stated that a single application of Melissa may lead to a complete remission of the disease. A possible cure! I&#x27;d figured I had nothing to lose, so I tried a little bottle of the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further research gave me a better idea of a protocol; direct application of the essential oil may not lead to a complete remission in one application - though healers were finding success with the oil&#x27;s regular use through the course of several outbreaks. One drop of Melissa directly applied a few times a day throughout the outbreak, and for the next several times an outbreak was surfacing, might lead to remission of the disease. The regemine was to begin as soon as one felt an outbreak coming on - some folks get an odd sensation at the location where the lesion may occur, and many will feel a general malaise. My outbreaks tended to occur on my tongue at that point - I would get the flu/fatigued feeling, then a few tasted buds would swell and sting, with the occasional cold sore showing itself (and yes, this had been medically confirmed as HSV early on when the sored almost completely covered the roof of my mouth). So I started on the Melissa, placing just one drop in my mouth and &#x27;swishing&#x27; it around a few times a day. It&#x27;s a powerful oil, but I actually liked the taste...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I wasn&#x27;t one of the fortunate one&#x27;s with a complete remission on the first try. But it did help - the outbreaks were shorter, and then seemed to occur less frequently. THEN something WONDERFUL happened - the outbreaks stopped all together. And believe me, my life has been no less stressful - more so if anything. But no matter how hard my days were, how heavy my weight training sessions or other athletic endeavors, the outbreaks have not returned! No more unexplained low-level flu symptoms or sore spots in or on my mouth. I can&#x27;t remember the last time this happened, and don&#x27;t even keep the bottle around anymore just in case - though I do recommend it to those in a similar position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to those who may have more sensitive skin than I, Melissa can be diluted in a carrier oil (like Hazelnut or Rosehip Seed oil) down to 10% or less of the total concentration and still be just as effective - taking any essential oil orally, and undiluted certainly, should be done with caution - pay attention to your own reaction and proceed accordingly. I haven&#x27;t any experience with the &#x27;genital&#x27; variety of the virus, but I it should work just as well - though this is where the carrier oil might feel a little nicer. But whatever way it&#x27;s used, the protocol should be followed as closely as possible: apply the oil a few times a day to the affected area as soon as you feel an outbreak coming on, and stick with it until the lesions have healed. Then do it again the next several times an outbreak is surfacing. There are no guarantees, but I do hope this wonderful natural medicine can provide the same relief for others as it has for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For sufferer&#x27;s of Shingles, another Herpes virus variety causing lesions of the skin, Ravensara (Ravensara aromatica, or &#x27;True&#x27; Ravensara) oil has been used. Individuals have found relief using Ravensara in a 50-50 blend with Tamanu Nut oil. The Tamanu Nut sooths the skin during the healing process and keeps the Ravensara in contact with the sores. I have not heard of this offering a complete cure, but I have heard of this blend really helping relieve discomfort of this condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you decide to try these natural methods, when buying essential oils, buy from a trusted source - Melissa oil particularly has been adulterated due to it&#x27;s high cost. The &#x27;fake&#x27; mixture - a blend of Lemongrass and other essential oils oils - do not contain the same antiviral components. True Melissa is typically found in the range of $10 - $20 per milliliter, with organic varieties costing a little more. There are nearly twenty-five drops in one milliliter, and because only one drop is typically used for each application, a few milliliters (1/4 to 1/8th ounce) can go a long way. If you try this natural healing oil, or to recommend it to those in need, I wish the best of success!nd yes, this had been medically confirmed as HSV early on when the sored almost completely covered the roof of my mouth).

    <li> Had seen that Lemonbalm an essential oil was suggested to reduce and possibly eliminate cold sores. it reduced however will need to wait for the long term suggested elimination....This particular brand of oil seems to be ok for what I purchased it for. It smells good too :)</li>
    <li> ..........but the reason I bought it was for its medicinal properties-anxiety relief. Rosemary oil is much better. I would buy again from this seller. The quality of the product is very good.</li>
    <li> I saw this product on Dr. Oz &amp; decided to try it--I suffer from cold sores every year &amp; have tried everything, with mixed results, but this worked for me. Put the oil in refrigerator &amp; put on a cotton ball &amp; apply to face.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my 37 year old daughter that had a cold sore as I was told it was good for that....she said it burned like crazy when she put it on and couldn&#x27;t use it for that purpose....money wasted.</li>
    <li> Well its a little over a year later and I&#x27;m ordering my second bottle. Yes, this tiny bottle lasted me a whole year!!! Of course I only used when needed in skin and have even added several drops to bath water from time to time. Don&#x27;t be put off by the bottle size, it really is a great quality oil and a small amount Def goes a long way. VERY effective as well.</li>
    <li> Worked first time I used it, but seemed to loose its effectiveness. Would not spend another dime on the product, sorry.</li>
    <li> not really what I expected. smells like lemon pledge</li>
    <li> Great product.  I love the smell and it help me feel better from insect bite also.</li>
    <li> Do the research, this stuff is a cure for so many things the medical industry must be paying to keep this oil a secret.  Every one should own this oil.</li>
    <li> We bought it for my husbands cold sores. We alternate between this and tea tree oil. I think it has expedited the life span of the sore, but no prevention. I will order again and combine it with the Hylands cold sore pills I recently discovered and hope that puts a big whammy on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil comes out VERY fast! I think the hubby over-used by a lot. It isn&#x27;t cheap either. So, just be careful. The oil is nice and refreshing, very lemony. Go figure ;)</li>
    <li> This a very small bottle, not at all worth the expense. But the oil, smell&#x27;s wonderful and works very well.</li>
    <li> I bought this 9 months or so ago, to treat cold sores, as I read that lemon balm oil can disrupt the viruses&#x27; DNA and keep it from replicating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this on when I felt the twinge of a cold sore, mixed into coconut oil, or any other carrier oil will do.. And I&#x27;m happy to say, the cold sores haven&#x27;t even tried to come back.  I used it twice and so I have a lot leftover😊&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also smells great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use it directly on the skin, because it will burn like hell.  Dilute a couple drops into another oil, and you will be good😊</li>
    <li> I love, LOOOOOOOOOVE Miracle Botanicals oils because that&#x27;s what they are. They are SO pure and strong, and energetically you feel yourself open right up. Each oil I have tried has been intoxicating and I can&#x27;t bring myself to try anything else once I&#x27;ve purchased an essential oil from here. I am slowly collecting them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was SHOCKED by *just* how strong this oil was but that&#x27;s a good thing! Now I know it will last me at least three times as long than I&#x27;d originally guessed. I am so happy that I treated myself to this Melissa and received it today! Next up? Sandalwood.  :-)</li>
    <li> Nice consistency.  Only need a dab.  I love that it is natural and doesn&#x27;t contain lots of chemical fillers or preservatives.</li>
    <li> Very good. Using it for Lyme protocol.</li>
    <li> good oil at that price</li>
    <li> Pure Melissa is a great anti viral . I have used several times and feel better .i work in the health care field and have many clients with many of those nasty bugs . It can be diluted in coconut oil and used on hands and other areas . Just AVOID  the eye area. Powerful protector. Go do your own research as to the benefits of Melissa and then start with a tiny drop, and see the results for yourself. I will buy this product and this brand again .</li>
    <li> Smells great! Works Greeat! More reasonable than all the others!</li>
    <li> I have never used Melissa oil before, but upon reading some good things about it, I decided to try it. It is a small bottle but you really don&#x27;t have to use alot. It&#x27;s very strong. Has a strong minty/lemony smell and I find that it is very soothing. I wouldn&#x27;t use full strength on skin as I said before it is VERY concentrated. (And I use a strong tea tree oil on my skin full strength, but I find this oil def needs a carrier becasue the concentration is so great.... Coconut oil is a great choice! :))&lt;br /&gt;I think the price was worth it and even though it&#x27;s a small bottle, It should last me awhile for sure. Will order again in the future.</li>
    <li> Great product, compares well to much more expensive brands.  I should mention I&#x27;m not applying it topically, it may need to be diluted for that.</li>
    <li> This does have a nice smell and seems to help congestion some. It is not a premium oil like Young Living but it is affordable.</li>
    <li> Loved the product, did exactly as all the reviews I read said it would.</li>
    <li> Revealing, profound, blissful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also very very potent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only Melissa I have tried but if there are others that claim to be stronger, then...then.....I just don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just the best.  Smells like my favorite candy, Lemonheads.  And it in one way or another, takes your depression and anxiety away.  This stuff works!  Thank you Hope and Miracle Botanicals!  I will be back.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome essential oil.  I love it!  Light lemon scent...&lt;br /&gt;I used it to mix with other essential oils as this one is worth it&#x27;s weight in gold...and added it to my body lotion -- I adore it and get compliments whenever I wear it.</li>
    <li> Please consider larger sizes.  This was absolutely gorgeous in scent and perfect for my remedy.  I Recommend this to all.</li>
