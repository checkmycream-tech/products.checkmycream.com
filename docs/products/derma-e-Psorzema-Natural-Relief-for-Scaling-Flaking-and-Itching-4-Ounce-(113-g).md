      <li>Excellent price!</li>
      <li>This product is excellent for my sons eczema, before he used to continuously have breakouts and nothing would relieve the itch and welts of inflammed skin even with doing a couple of treatments with antibiotics when his skin would turn into welts but after finding a regimen using psorzema</li>
      <li>GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
      <li>this stuff is awesome</li>
      <li>In the meantime, this is the best creme I found to relieve the itching and help with the healing process.</li>
      <li>Great Product helps with my problem skin.</li>
      <li>Great stuff.</li>
      <li>and he&#x27;s absolutely happy with it.</li>
      <li>I have eczema patches on my arms and legs and this has greatly improved the look and feel of the skin in about a week.</li>
      <li>A great product, arrives on time, good price and reliable seller.</li>
      <li>and I had a good perception of the company.</li>
      <li>Wonderful product worth the buy</li>
      <li>Purple emu shampoo and derma e have my scalp happy and healthy.  </li>
      <li>It was reasonably priced for a chemical-free product (as is all of Derma-e&#x27;s excellent line).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so I took matters into my own hands.</li>
      <li>It feels nice on the skin, and has no coal tar or mineral oil</li>
      <li>Wonderful product that is far healthier</li>
      <li>It works like magic, goes on smooth, not sticky, odorless and most effective!</li>
      <li>He went through that jar and that&#x27;s why I bought two more from amazon.</li>
      <li>This was much more convenient.</li>
      <li>Also, that stuff is sticky and can&#x27;t be applied if you want to be touching anything.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
      <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not one to review without a strong desire to do so.</li>
      <li>This is first time in my life, that i write a review, but I have to let other desparete people know about this wonderful product.  </li>
      <li>good to find a product that does what it is supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;i will definitely order again.</li>
      <li>I tried it myself and was surprised at how nicely quickly it absorbs, and I love the fact that it&#x27;s scent free.</li>
      <li>Finally found relief in this wonderful jar and use it on a daily basis to keep the eczema away.  </li>
      <li>can&#x27;t thank this cream enough, honestly.</li>
      <li>but then I thought, is it worth to risk my health for this?</li>
      <li>Once we started rinsing off right after a swim, and applying this just out of the shower, the girls have had zero traces of eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I broke out with eczema for the first time in my 40&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a nice, thick consistency but spreads easily.</li>
      <li>but this keeps my rough itch legs calm and the skin healthy.</li>
      <li>The first day I wore it, my whole face felt like it was burning.</li>
      <li>So when I lost hope i bought this cream at a whole foods store, just as another moisturizer without having any expectations, and it did a miracle.  </li>
      <li>just like all natural healing methods, it takes time but worth the wait.....</li>
      <li>and my fiance was really having problems on his forearms and shins.</li>
      <li>It took me a while to figure out that the allergy was responsible.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this on my sensitive skin for a couple of years and recently bought some for my 85 yr old Mother, she liked it a lot too.</li>
      <li>very helpful.</li>
      <li>After having been to many doctors and trying numerous prescription ointments as well as natural home remedies and variable diets, a friend and colleague recommended Derme e Psorzema.</li>
      <li>My son&amp;#34;s skin is completely clear!!!  </li>
      <li>The jar at home is still quite full even after several months&#x27; use on both girls post-bathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>would highly recommend this product to a friend or family member, and I recommend it heartily to you, too.</li>
      <li>&#x27;s wishing you the same success I&#x27;ve had for whatever your skincare challenge is.</li>
      <li>I used it for one week and saw considerable change</li>
      <li>I developed a seafood allergy.</li>
      <li>Even though the healing is almost completely finished, I&#x27;ll still be using this as a moisturizing lotion.</li>
      <li>I should also mention that I used a prescription steroid creme, but you can&#x27;t really use that constantly.</li>
      <li>I tried almost everything you can imagine from steroids to all natural remedies.  </li>
      <li>The jars will last quite a while, but try to keep them out of heat - I think the one we used in our swim bag, which was exposed to high temperatures, saw some evaporation / melting of product.</li>
      <li>he no long has to breakouts, if he does I increase the times I apply the cream and within a day he is back to normal!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone with issues like mine or as a general moisturizer because it works so well.</li>
      <li>This is the only lotion I have found that completely eliminates my daughters&#x27; eczema.</li>
      <li>I can barely see any redness.</li>
      <li>I really thought it was peri-oral dermatitis at this point and discontinued parabens and other harmful chemicals.</li>
      <li>He had eczema all over his little body, couldn&#x27;t sleep at night, was very fussy during the day.  </li>

<li> My son had a very bad eczema since birth.</li>
<li> And the healing is a miserable process that I wouldn&#x27;t wish on anyone.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I swear by this product.  I broke out with eczema for the first time in my 40&#x27;s.  I tried everything including steroids, diet changes and acucpunture.  Finally found relief in this wonderful jar and use it on a daily basis to keep the eczema away.  Haven&#x27;t had a break out in years.</li>
    <li> I have rosacea. It only started about 2 years ago.  I work with the public in a grocery store.  I have had my feelings hurt many times by unthinking customers asking, \\&quot;what&#x27;s wrong with your face?\\&quot;  I got this product as a sample and have been thankful ever since.  The redness and pustules have all but disappeared since trying this product.  Thank you for giving me happier days, dermaE!</li>
    <li> Have used and like it a lot for relieving symptoms.</li>
    <li> I have eczema patches on my arms and legs and this has greatly improved the look and feel of the skin in about a week. The patches aren&#x27;t flaky/scaley/dry at all and the patches are less red.  I would be a little cautious if your skin is broken though - it does sting alittle after applying.   My eczema actually looks like it will heal this time (the rx cortisone cream didn&#x27;t work for me - burned very badly).</li>
    <li> my husband hand eczema. saved only by this cream. not greasy ,not sticky. very helpful.</li>
    <li> Great Product helps with my problem skin.</li>
    <li> I developed a seafood allergy. It was causing dyshidrosis on my hands and a rash on my neck and shoulders. It took me a while to figure out that the allergy was responsible. In the meantime, this is the best creme I found to relieve the itching and help with the healing process. And the healing is a miserable process that I wouldn&#x27;t wish on anyone. This creme absorbs nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave a bad residue or a crazy smell. When I couldn&#x27;t find this, I tried the Derma e Vitamin E 12,000 IU Creme. I couldn&#x27;t stand the way it felt or smelled. So now I&#x27;m ordering this from Amazon because I can&#x27;t find it locally. Even though the healing is almost completely finished, I&#x27;ll still be using this as a moisturizing lotion. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone with issues like mine or as a general moisturizer because it works so well. I should also mention that I used a prescription steroid creme, but you can&#x27;t really use that constantly. Also, that stuff is sticky and can&#x27;t be applied if you want to be touching anything. This was much more convenient.</li>
    <li> this stuff is awesome and i already have a friend try it out and he&#x27;s absolutely happy with it. his skin is healing wonderfully. he spent lots of money on prescribed ointment and cream from MDs and none helped like this stuff. just like all natural healing methods, it takes time but worth the wait.....</li>
    <li> I have suffered from eczema for over 20 years and this is the BEST treatment I have yet to discover,  Wonderful product that is far healthier that the steroids that my physician suggests.  Purple emu shampoo and derma e have my scalp happy and healthy.  GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> A great product, arrives on time, good price and reliable seller. I don&#x27;t have Psoriasis or Excema but this keeps my rough itch legs calm and the skin healthy. Almost everything else irritates my skin.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent for my sons eczema, before he used to continuously have breakouts and nothing would relieve the itch and welts of inflammed skin even with doing a couple of treatments with antibiotics when his skin would turn into welts but after finding a regimen using psorzema he no long has to breakouts, if he does I increase the times I apply the cream and within a day he is back to normal! Wonderful product worth the buy</li>
    <li> it works!&lt;br /&gt;always good to find a product that does what it is supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;i will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> My Fiance has severe plaque psoriasis and NOTHING helps when he has a flare up. I happened to pick up a jar of this at the drug store because it was on sale and my fiance was really having problems on his forearms and shins. I&#x27;d tried a few products from this company before and I had a good perception of the company. I gave the jar to my fiance, and told him to use it. I tried it myself and was surprised at how nicely quickly it absorbs, and I love the fact that it&#x27;s scent free. After about 3 days we both noticed a big difference in his skin. He went through that jar and that&#x27;s why I bought two more from amazon. we&#x27;re very happy with it. It feels nice on the skin, and has no coal tar or mineral oil</li>
    <li> This is the only lotion I have found that completely eliminates my daughters&#x27; eczema. Both of them, at four and six, suffer from it severely in the summer during swimming season. Once we started rinsing off right after a swim, and applying this just out of the shower, the girls have had zero traces of eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice, thick consistency but spreads easily. The jars will last quite a while, but try to keep them out of heat - I think the one we used in our swim bag, which was exposed to high temperatures, saw some evaporation / melting of product. The jar at home is still quite full even after several months&#x27; use on both girls post-bathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to a friend or family member, and I recommend it heartily to you, too.</li>
    <li> I have had mild-moderate dyshidrosis eczema for about six years now and this creme is the ONLY thing that has ever helped soothe and heal my rashes. It does take a while for the rashes to go away. Unfortunately, they eventually come back (weeks-months later) once I stop using the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply a small amount a few times throughout the day and my eczema is healed within two weeks.</li>
    <li> This is the only non-itch cream I&#x27;ve tried that does what it claims.  It is the only thing that has helped to heal my eczema.  I even used it on my itchy feet one night so I could sleep...worked like a charm.  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> This is first time in my life, that i write a review, but I have to let other desparete people know about this wonderful product.  My son had a very bad eczema since birth. He had eczema all over his little body, couldn&#x27;t sleep at night, was very fussy during the day.  I tried almost everything you can imagine from steroids to all natural remedies.  I would give him a bath in Epsom salt, olive oil, herbs, you name it, I tried it.  So when I lost hope i bought this cream at a whole foods store, just as another moisturizer without having any expectations, and it did a miracle.  My son&amp;#34;s skin is completely clear!!!  I can&#x27;t thank enough to people that created it.  It works.</li>
    <li> My 91 year-old mother has been suffering with severe eczema on her arms and legs for a year. After having been to many doctors and trying numerous prescription ointments as well as natural home remedies and variable diets, a friend and colleague recommended Derme e Psorzema. I ordered online and we are now on the fourth jar. It works like magic, goes on smooth, not sticky, odorless and most effective! My mother, my sister andI are all so grateful. Thankfully for a terrific product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one to review without a strong desire to do so. This product is A STAR.&lt;br /&gt;Let me explain. I started getting scaly, itchy redness around my nose in January. I was diagnosed with seborrheic dermatitis. I got over the counter steroids and it did nothing. I finally went to my PCP and he prescribed stronger steroids. Two weeks into that and I saw no change whatsoever. By then, I&#x27;m already freaking out because I look hideous. But I brush it away and think it will eventually go away.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s already March or April. I went to the allergist and due to my desperation, prescribed this horrible medicine called Protopic. The first day I wore it, my whole face felt like it was burning. I read the secondary effects and I was in shock: skin cancer!? So I discontinued. But two weeks after that my face took a turn for worse and I decided to give the toxic cream a chance. I used it for one week and saw considerable change but then I thought, is it worth to risk my health for this? I stopped.&lt;br /&gt;My face then became this redness blob and it was worse than ever. I really thought it was peri-oral dermatitis at this point and discontinued parabens and other harmful chemicals. But I doubt that was the cause. I was about to go for a trip so I took matters into my own hands. I searched for other medical options and a friend recommended an anti-fungal cream. The problem was that I couldn&#x27;t get it without prescription so I waited for a friend to bring it from abroad.&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, a few days into my extreme desperation, I walked into Whole Foods looking for a solution. I don&#x27;t know why I picked this cream among all the other creams. But I&#x27;m glad I did. I started using it twice a day starting at the end of May. Things improved dramatically a week after that. Today? I can barely see any redness. It doesn&#x27;t itch and I don&#x27;t look like a monster if I don&#x27;t wear makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t thank this cream enough, honestly.</li>
    <li> This product takes care of my psoriasis outbreak everytime.  As they say, once you find something that works, keep it in stock.</li>
    <li> Excellent price! Provides some relief from the scaling of psoriasis.</li>
    <li> Had been troubled with red, blotchy, rosacea for years.  Then I started having flaking, though I don&#x27;t have psoriasis.  Tried everything.  Nothing helped, not even Rx from various dermatologists.  But one has to keep hoping.  So I read the product description of Psorzema and thought it might work.  It was reasonably priced for a chemical-free product (as is all of Derma-e&#x27;s excellent line).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediate results.  Shocking really.  After sooo many years of bad skin, I&#x27;m no longer afraid of mirrors, and can actually smile at them now.  ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s wishing you the same success I&#x27;ve had for whatever your skincare challenge is.</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin. No added ingredients or perfumes to irritate. I&#x27;ve used this on my sensitive skin for a couple of years and recently bought some for my 85 yr old Mother, she liked it a lot too.</li>
