      <li>I liked the feel and the fullness after use.</li>
      <li>I first bought this conditioner about 2 years ago, and it smelled great.  </li>
      <li>I would have given this product a 5 star if I honestly felt that it is the best in the conditioner department , but although close  I think American Crew stimulating conditioner is a notch better mostly in the cooling feel .</li>
      <li>But I won&#x27;t be buying more of this.</li>
      <li>and he is totally in love with it and says his hair looks thicker on top</li>

      <li>I really like this shampoo</li>
      <li>I much prefer their All-Soft conditioner.</li>

      <li>I was expecting something special from the \\&quot;invigorating\\&quot; description, but I hardly feel anything and the conditioning that it provides isn&#x27;t any better than the cheapy brand at the drugstore.</li>
      <li>Lol... I know how weird it sounds, but that is exactly what it feels like.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not magic, just a nice product.</li>

      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>This is a nice product but really no different than other lower priced shampoo and conditioners.</li>
      <li>Probably a good idea to alternate this conditioner with other ones and use it only when you feel like you want a mint for your head XD.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>It now smells like an old man&#x27;s ointment.  </li>
      <li>The only downside is if you use it for like a week (every day) it starts to get old and you stop getting the same feeling that you had the first time you used it.</li>
      <li>I generally like Redkin products, but not this one.</li>
      <li>This is the same bottle, but they COMPLETELY changed the fragrance.  </li>
      <li>A smooth subtle mint aroma.  </li>

<li> Disappointed in that.</li>
<li> It is absolutely disgusting.  </li>

    <li> I would have given this product a 5 star if I honestly felt that it is the best in the conditioner department , but although close  I think American Crew stimulating conditioner is a notch better mostly in the cooling feel .</li>
    <li> If your scalp were your mouth it would be like eating a york peppermint pattie. Invigorating! I highly recommend feeding your scalp/mouth some of this conditioner/peppermint pattie.</li>
    <li> Wow! The conditioner is soothing, tingling on the scalp, and makes my hair feeling healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also pair this conditioner with the Redken densifying shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mint  is perfect for a massaging, healthy experience for my hair. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product but really no different than other lower priced shampoo and conditioners. I have used Suave for Men mint and it works as good for less $$.</li>
    <li> Some men just don&#x27;t care about shampoos and the quality of style they get from their product, but I do.  This lathers well and smells great.  It helps me get going in the morning with the strong minty scent.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so thick that you can&#x27;t hardly shake it down to squeeze it out of the bottle. I was expecting something special from the \\&quot;invigorating\\&quot; description, but I hardly feel anything and the conditioning that it provides isn&#x27;t any better than the cheapy brand at the drugstore. Maybe I got a bottle that&#x27;s been sitting on a shelf for 4 years. Who knows? But I won&#x27;t be buying more of this.</li>
    <li> Good product and results</li>
    <li> If you put on the conditioner and leave it for a minute or so, it will give your head this cooling finish as if your head just ate a mint. Lol... I know how weird it sounds, but that is exactly what it feels like. The only downside is if you use it for like a week (every day) it starts to get old and you stop getting the same feeling that you had the first time you used it. Probably a good idea to alternate this conditioner with other ones and use it only when you feel like you want a mint for your head XD.</li>
    <li> Hair looks great, healthy, and good shine after use.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo and once I found it I never stopped using it. Its been two years now and I still really love it!</li>
    <li> I generally like Redkin products, but not this one. It smells like Mentholatum. It is tingly on my beard, but not on my head. I much prefer their All-Soft conditioner.</li>
    <li> Has a minty, cooling feel on your scalp.</li>
    <li> Product delivery and order experience was super. Product is not invigorating to me at all. Disappointed in that.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, but pricey and would of preferred to buy the large container to save money but can&#x27;t find it on Amazon. So I settled to buy two of these instead. It has a nice feel and smell as such a premium, priced product should.</li>
    <li> I was at Ulta and bought my husband the Redken \\&quot;Densify\\&quot; shampoo and he is totally in love with it and says his hair looks thicker on top and it really does, he says it feels thicker to when he put&#x27;s on his gel. So he needed a conditioner to which the Densify line doesn&#x27;t have a conditioner so he tried this, he loves it,he said it tingles and feels so good and his head has stopped itching.. The two together is my husbands favorite hair products and so glad he finally found one&#x27;s he loves.</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past and liked it. The scent was a pleasant citrus mint.  The contents of this most recently ordered bottle smelled like vapor rub.</li>
    <li> I first bought this conditioner about 2 years ago, and it smelled great.  A smooth subtle mint aroma.  It also worked well, so I liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That has changed!  This is the same bottle, but they COMPLETELY changed the fragrance.  It no longer has that smooth mint smell.  It now smells like an old man&#x27;s ointment.  It&#x27;s sort of a mix between Vic&#x27;s VapoRub and spearmint gum.  It is absolutely disgusting.  Since it&#x27;s not something that can be returned, I just threw out the bottle.  The smell is that foul.</li>
    <li> My son has wavy hair.  He loves this product - helps control his hair.&lt;br /&gt;I buy it and send it off to college to him.</li>
    <li> very good conditioner.</li>
    <li> This conditioner was used at a hair salon when I got my hair cut. I liked the feel and the fullness after use. I use it after a shower and I do think it leaves my hair less tangled and softer. It also gives a slightly fuller appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue to use it. It&#x27;s not magic, just a nice product.</li>
