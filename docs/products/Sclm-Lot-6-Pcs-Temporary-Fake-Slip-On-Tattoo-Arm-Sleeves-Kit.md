      <li>theyre fun for like halloween, you have to  have same skin color or not a tan the more colorful ones work better,and you cant really wear without a bracelet or a t-shirt,unless maybe you pin to your tank top,or you have bigger arms</li>
      <li>Nice sleeve but not long enough for taller users.</li>
      <li>Yes, absolutely.</li>
      <li>These are not made very well, 2 seams on each arm and the design does not line up.  </li>
      <li>it does look like a real tattoo from the distance.</li>
      <li>, they looks completely real, everybody ask me when they see them on my arms, When did you get them?</li>
      <li>they looked so real</li>
      <li>Within arms length, no one will believe they are real tattoos.</li>
      <li>When I bought these I was under the assumption that they would be rather transparent, and therefore could look real on any skin color/tone.</li>
      <li>but these really trick my family</li>
      <li>It runs a little small on adult arms but still a great throw around product, I love the way they feel.</li>
      <li>They lasted thru a pretty wild party</li>
      <li>I ordered a different set at the same time as this order and those are much better.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 140lb female and he is 200lb male and they stretch to fit both of our arms really well!</li>

      <li>Only good for small arms.  </li>
      <li>Other reviews are accurate.</li>
      <li>This was exactly what i was looking for and expected.. looks very real from a distance and you cannot beat the price.</li>
      <li>They were marked for Adult size but were made out of a material that didn&#x27;t stretch much and made the part of my arm, that I could get in, look peachy orange.</li>
      <li>The sleeves were different but kind of small.</li>
      <li>HOWEVER, consider if you have muscular or larger arms at the top, these will roll down easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They are also sheer enough that they blend with your skin tone but the &amp;#34;ink&amp;#34; is bold enough to really stand out.  </li>
      <li>Looks real if your skin color is the same as these.</li>
      <li>Pretty cool the first day but after that it was lame.</li>
      <li>These are a fun joke, but they have two seems and aren&#x27;t quite long enough.</li>
      <li>Slightly more mass produced and a little bit less considerate of where the seam is.</li>
      <li>However, they were an &amp;#34;apricot&amp;#34; color and only the really decorated ones that didn&#x27;t have much empty space could possibly be worn by someone of a darker skin tone.</li>

    <li> My girlfriend needed some of these for a Halloween costume, they worked perfect for her arms, she has normal girl arms I guess, not stick arms and not super buff arms. They fit perfectly</li>
    <li> will get money back by the surprise of many thinking that they might be the real thing ha ha..ha yes</li>
    <li> These are a fun joke, but they have two seems and aren&#x27;t quite long enough. They run easily and they don&#x27;t fit those of us with bigger arms.</li>
    <li> I love these tattoo sleeves because they keep my arms, and or my legs warm with a little style. Very fun product, and the kids will love em!</li>
    <li> I get lots of compliments on the look and feel, so they have been recommended for purchase by other individuals.</li>

    <li> [[VIDEOID:2a5388cdb8e0b63e178ef2818825a71c]] 🎬 Video Review 🎬&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;✏️ Plus Bonus Top 5 Beau Thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;If I had 30 seconds to chat with someone who is considering purchasing this, I would share these top 5 things from my own experience of the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1⃣ Looks real if your skin color is the same as these. Note: Works best for Caucasian type skins.&lt;br /&gt;2⃣ Fooled quite a few people from a far.&lt;br /&gt;3⃣ Not for people with big arms. If you&#x27;re skinny, these will work.&lt;br /&gt;4⃣ Cheaply priced. Note: They&#x27;re super-thin nylon type material.  Put them on carefully or you might rip them.&lt;br /&gt;5⃣ Excellent variety of designs.  Note: there&#x27;s one design where there&#x27;s some nudity (not the one I show in the video... it&#x27;s another one showing a nun with no shirt on. Everything&#x27;s showing! Just keep this in mind if you&#x27;re getting this for a kid.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this is helpful! Note the company sent me this product to demonstrate on video and offer my personal opinion. I don&#x27;t work for them, nor am I paid anything that might sway my personal opinion of this product&#x27;s performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;📍 Bottom line: would I recommend this product to one of my friends?&lt;br /&gt;👍 Yes, absolutely.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what i was looking for and expected.. looks very real from a distance and you cannot beat the price.</li>
    <li> Great material, they looks completely real, everybody ask me when they see them on my arms, When did you get them? Did it hurts?</li>
    <li> Good product. I got this for my dad to freak out my mom. it does look like a real tattoo from the distance.</li>
    <li> I bought them as a gag gift and photo idea to show son who is over seas in Army, From a  distance they look ok.</li>
    <li> Sleeves are not tapered.  Only good for small arms.  Females may be able to use, but difficult for males to use.  Prints are good.  Variety is OK.</li>
    <li> The sleeves were better than expected and a lot of fun!! Ordered them as a gag gift and kept some for me.</li>
    <li> These are nice. Decent quality and great value.&lt;br /&gt;More believable if you wear a shirt with sleeves and sweatbands at the wrist (also helpful of course if your skin tone is light [these have &#x27;caucasian&#x27; skin color in them...not &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34;]).</li>
    <li> THIS IS AWESOME BUT IT IS GREAT IF YOU ARE DOING SOME DRESS UP AT A HALLOWEEEN PARTY&lt;br /&gt;GREAT FOR THE PRICE</li>
    <li> Other reviews are accurate. They are OK quality, from across the room they look good. Within arms length, no one will believe they are real tattoos. The seams are visible up close. The art work itself is good, some tattoo sleeves look like cartoon drawings, so that part I am happy with. Again, for the price and occasional use, they are good, I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Each one of these was so special in its own right!  For several of them, a cuff or watch will be necessary to camouflage the seams at the wrist--BUT, OH, SO AWESOME &amp; WORTH EVERY PENNY!!</li>
    <li> When I bought these I was under the assumption that they would be rather transparent, and therefore could look real on any skin color/tone. However, they were an &amp;#34;apricot&amp;#34; color and only the really decorated ones that didn&#x27;t have much empty space could possibly be worn by someone of a darker skin tone. Also, they don&#x27;t necessarily stay on every person&#x27;s arm without slipping off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they are cheap, so I don&#x27;t feel too bad about spending my money on them. Also they can be kind of fun. I gave one to each member of my family and we played around a bit.</li>
    <li> These are not made very well, 2 seams on each arm and the design does not line up.  I ordered a different set at the same time as this order and those are much better.  So look around you can get betters one than these</li>
    <li> I paid for these over a month ago and they have yet to get to me :( very sad and disappointed</li>
    <li> I bought it just for fun, so the fun that I got.</li>
    <li> I often get a few very inexpensive novelty items to give away. The sleeves are not as well printed and they&#x27;re smaller than the others... okay for a smaller person or child. Slightly more mass produced and a little bit less considerate of where the seam is. For the price I guess they&#x27;re okay but I&#x27;ve gotten better deals.</li>
    <li> This is probably as close to as tattoo as I will get. Too bad, but at least if I decide later not to have the &amp;#34;tat&amp;#34; I can just take the sleeve off. They are a little small for me, but the skin tone is good and it&#x27;s not easy to see (at least from a distance) that it&#x27;s not a real tat.</li>
    <li> Is just half sleeves at least you are really skinny, I will not recommend for men, skinny girls and boys only</li>
    <li> I loved the fake tattoo sleeves and have had a blast wearing it and shocking my friends and relatives.</li>
    <li> Fits nicely and looks cool. This is also offered at a great price. I wish they could have more variety &amp; better design. Would love to reorder.</li>
    <li> So me and my boyfriend were rockers for Halloween and we were both able to use these! I&#x27;m a 140lb female and he is 200lb male and they stretch to fit both of our arms really well! Also they come in a variety of shades so some were a little tan for me and pasty white for him! The prints are really fun. They lasted thru a pretty wild party so I can say they are durable!</li>
    <li> This really is exactly as advertised and for an even better price. The only problem is that it could take a couple months to get because it ships from CHINA.</li>
    <li> Looked very real without permanent inking . Fooled a lot of my family members. Got a kick out of them</li>
    <li> Sooooo much fun to fake people out.</li>
    <li> These are so darn cool ive got NO tattoos but these really trick my family and when I o out n public they honestly look real</li>
    <li> Nice sleeve but not long enough for taller users. Also, the selection is a bit of a crap shoot so you may not like what you receive in a package.</li>
    <li> These are the best fitting tattoo sleeves I have found and they look just like the pic.  They are made out of panty hose material and stretch to fit any size arm. They are also sheer enough that they blend with your skin tone but the &amp;#34;ink&amp;#34; is bold enough to really stand out.  I stopped in at the local party store after I ordered these and became worried after I tried the ones at the store on. They were marked for Adult size but were made out of a material that didn&#x27;t stretch much and made the part of my arm, that I could get in, look peachy orange.</li>
    <li> Very fun. I gave as gift.v</li>
    <li> These sleeves are well made and sturdy. They won&#x27;t run or pick easily. HOWEVER, consider if you have muscular or larger arms at the top, these will roll down easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are good for cyclists, sports, warmth, and fun. :-)</li>
    <li> They were cool but as soon as I put my hand in it started stripping.</li>
    <li> i use it when i go out mtb. They give very good protection for the sun, dust and weather. Best thing is i got 6 differents tattos sleeves for 6 dollars.</li>
    <li> These are very reasonably prices, well made and provide a great SHOCK factor for friends and family without the pain.  Even though they come direct from China, shipping time was amazingly quick, even clearing customs.</li>
    <li> spend the money for better quality. the sleeves work but only for a little while then they stretch out. Also there is a very noticeable seem that runs down the sleeve that make it look fake.</li>
    <li> Works great for me!!&lt;br /&gt;No complain&lt;br /&gt;For the money works !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cool now&lt;br /&gt;will take some&lt;br /&gt;shoots ;)&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this!</li>
    <li> UGLIEST things ever. And I have little arms so it didn&#x27;t look good on me. These are definitely NOT &amp;#34;one size fits all&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> theyre fun for like halloween, you have to  have same skin color or not a tan the more colorful ones work better,and you cant really wear without a bracelet or a t-shirt,unless maybe you pin to your tank top,or you have bigger arms, im a small woman,hope thats helpfull</li>
    <li> fun to use, people think they are real especially from afar.</li>
    <li> My hubby bought them..and since he&#x27;s  dark complected (hispanic) they do look fake..to whire for his skin color...lol&lt;br /&gt;The tattoos look faded when you put the sleeve on.</li>
    <li> ordered them for my grandsons as a joke. they looked so real i wore them to a reunion for about 10 minuets.  worth the money.</li>
