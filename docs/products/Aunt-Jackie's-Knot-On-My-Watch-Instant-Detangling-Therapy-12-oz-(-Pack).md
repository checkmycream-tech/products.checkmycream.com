      <li>Funny thing, I had an Aunt Jackie in my family too</li>

      <li>and it seem to work better on wet hair.</li>
      <li>fast delivery but</li>
      <li>I had never heard of this brand until I was given a free sample at my local beauty supply.</li>
      <li>They really do work.</li>
      <li>This product is nothing special, it pretty much just like any other detaingler.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t buy it online but buy multiple bottles of it at my favorite beauty supply here in Southern Cal.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
      <li>After going thorough several other products, I received this in my curlkit and my daughter and I fell in love!  </li>
      <li>I was looking for a detangler from \\&quot;Miss Jessie&#x27;s\\&quot; product line because that&#x27;s what I normally use on her hair</li>
      <li>She has beautiful coils that, when wet, stretch down to the bottom of her back.</li>
      <li>This is a must have for me and my daughter natural hair!</li>
      <li>And when her hair is properly conditioned, I&#x27;ve found the detanglers really aren&#x27;t needed!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the first detangler that works instantly on curly harly</li>
      <li>I would suggest checking it out in your local beauty supply first.</li>
      <li>I put it on dry hair, i have to use more product, but wet hair doesn&#x27;t require as much.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I put it right on the dry hair</li>
      <li>It also leave my hair feeling soft and moist and I can now see the definitions of my curl.</li>
      <li>This is a must have product in my natural hair care tool kit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It leaves your hair soft with defined curls and is non greasy to touch.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product for my biracial 7 year old daughter.  </li>
      <li>I am in the process of unlocking my hair after almost 10 years and this is helping keep my hair soft as I dig through the knots with a rat tail comb and a flea comb.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product for those on a natural hair journey.</li>
      <li>I am a 4C natural.</li>

      <li>I was able to slowly pull each of them apart with close to no breakage and using just my fingers.  </li>
      <li>I recently did the big chop and ever since I&#x27;ve been natural, nothing has made my hair feel softer than this stuff right here.</li>
      <li>It makes her hair soft and so much easier to comb due to the detangler.</li>
      <li>have really thick 4C hair and this works perfectly fine for</li>
      <li>Found this at Dollar General for $5...</li>
      <li>This is $5.00 in dollar general and family dollar.</li>
      <li>I barely have any residue on my hands when I touch my hair.</li>
      <li>3 days later, my hair is still soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>My gf bought this (from a local store) for our 8 mth old daughter curly hair ...</li>
      <li>I use this with my daughters hair and it is the only one of these products, so far, that makes it easier to comb and deal with her hair.</li>
      <li>My hair was so dry and brittle and most products I used either left my hair too hard or too greasy.</li>

    <li> I purchased this product for my biracial 7 year old daughter.  She was with her grandmother for a week and she told her she could do her own hair. That worked only for the top layers.  My daughter didn&#x27;t bother to comb through the bottom layers.  She just continued to put it in a ponytail with too much product until it was so matted and almost had dreads in it!  I was looking for a detangler from \\&quot;Miss Jessie&#x27;s\\&quot; product line because that&#x27;s what I normally use on her hair but the store I was in didn&#x27;t have it. I saw this and decided to give it a try.  I am happy to report that it worked miracles on her hair.  I put it right on the dry hair in it seeped into the matted sections.  I was able to slowly pull each of them apart with close to no breakage and using just my fingers.  Then the comb went through it with no problem.  I think the fact that it is thin is what makes it work so well.  Thicker stuff usually cant get inside of truly tangled hair without having to work through it.  This  has the advantage of being like an oil coating but in a creamy silky form. I am going to try Aunt Jackie&#x27;s entire product line!</li>
    <li> Made my coils easy to comb through. The only down side is you have to use a lot of it and it seem to work better on wet hair.</li>
    <li> This is a must have for me and my daughter natural hair!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing and I definitely will be purchasing more. It&#x27;s the first detangler that works instantly on curly harly and i have tight natural corkscrew curls.</li>
    <li> Makes it so easy to detangle my curls before a wash</li>
    <li> I am a 4C natural. I love this product it detangles, softens, and silkens the hair. It has a greasy after feel but I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have thick 4b/c hair and nothing set angles my hair better than this!  Not only has it cut down the time it takes to diet angle my coils, it leaves my hair sooo soft!  I also use it on my daughters 3c/4a hair and it acts the same way!&lt;br /&gt;This is a staple for sure!</li>
    <li> This is the best product so far for my natural 4C hair. I started going natural 2 years ago, I have thick dry and brittle hair. I hated wash days because I would damage my hair every time trying to detangle,  after awhile I was only using my fingers to detangle but when I wash my hair it world be so tangled up. I found this and it has done wonders for my hair. I can now comb small sections of my 4C hair with a tail-comb. It also leave my hair feeling soft and moist and I can now see the definitions of my curl. I am going to use this product for a long time.</li>
    <li> fast delivery but the bottle leaked when it arrived in the package and some of the product was lost</li>
    <li> This is a miracle product- I have extra thick &amp; course hair. I have tried several products- it works and  I love it!</li>
    <li> I sprayed my daughters hair with water and sectioned it off. I applied this to each section. It gave awesome slip. Its most likely best used on the hair thats sectioned off into multiple pieces/plaits. Especially if ur hair is thick. Downfall is the price on here. Side eye at the seller. This is $5.00 in dollar general and family dollar. Theres no way i would pay what these folks charge.</li>
    <li> I use this with my daughters hair and it is the only one of these products, so far, that makes it easier to comb and deal with her hair.</li>
    <li> Great detangler, I have thick natural hair and this product works wonders in detangling the most stubborn tangles and knots. This is a must have and I will always have this in my stash.</li>
    <li> Used for the first time yesterday and it was AMAZING. No complaints here.</li>
    <li> The best leave in for 4c kinky , tangling coily hair. Have not used anything better to date . I try hundreds of products and this one surpassed all.</li>
    <li> s***...It does n&#x27;t curl!</li>
    <li> After going thorough several other products, I received this in my curlkit and my daughter and I fell in love!  The smell is amazing and the comb passes through my daughter&#x27;s hair with ease!!  The price isn&#x27;t bad considering I was paying $30 for the &amp;#34;Miss J&#x27;s&amp;#34; and using a WHOLE LOT more with other product and my daughter was still crying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only Knot on my watch from here on out!</li>
    <li> Love these hair products! They really do work.</li>
    <li> I use this on mine and my daughters 4a/b natural hair and it cuts the wash day process down by half an hour,  I do wish it has more slippage,  but its the best one I&#x27;ve tried so far...actually it&#x27;s the only one...lol</li>
    <li> THE BEST detangler I have ever used on my hair!</li>
    <li> This leave-in works perfectly for my bi-racial 6 yr old&#x27;s curls. She has beautiful coils that, when wet, stretch down to the bottom of her back. If her hair air-dries with little product, her curls will bring her hair up to shoulder length. With these glorious curls comes lots of grooming. Knot On My Watch works perfectly, pulling double duty, as a detangler and to define her curls while drying.</li>
    <li> I use this when I need to detangle, on damp hair and with coconut oil. I have very thick and long (between midback and waist length) 3c/4a hair. Applying this detangler helps my fingers and comb glide right through. Found this at Dollar General for $5... Really works well!...</li>
    <li> This is just amazing! 👍really detangles your hair instantly. Great product my mom and I both use it. I just wish they had different bottle sizes; 12oz is a bit to small when used by two people. Other than that it&#x27;s just simply great.</li>
    <li> The best detangler I have used to date.</li>
    <li> Best detangler on the market.  Hands down.</li>
    <li> This product is nothing special, it pretty much just like any other detaingler.</li>
    <li> I use this product daily on my daughter and it works great.  It makes her hair soft and so much easier to comb due to the detangler.</li>
    <li> I am in the process of unlocking my hair after almost 10 years and this is helping keep my hair soft as I dig through the knots with a rat tail comb and a flea comb. The scent is nice and not overpowering. I&#x27;m using this in conjunction with the shampoo.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work to get the knots out of my hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for few times- at damp hair, dry hair, wet hair; small amount and a lot. But it does absolutely nothing! Moreover, when it dries it feels like hair even drier then before using that product! I use oil for hair by garnier fructis for $5 - much better!</li>
    <li> It makes your hair nice and soft and manageable it is great you should try it. would buy again. Just great</li>
    <li> This is a must have product in my natural hair care tool kit.&lt;br /&gt;I have really thick 4C hair and this works perfectly fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;If I put it on dry hair, i have to use more product, but wet hair doesn&#x27;t require as much.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t buy it online but buy multiple bottles of it at my favorite beauty supply here in Southern Cal.&lt;br /&gt;Not all stores have it so I stock up on it when I can.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of crazy scent to it which is another bonus. I&#x27;m not a fan of heavily fragranced products.&lt;br /&gt;I usually get it for about 7.99 a bottle.</li>
    <li> I had to buy another leave in since my usual one is hard to find and it was currently unavailable. So, I tried this since it is protein-free. It moisturises OK, but its biggest problem is that it is an insult to its name. I had so many huge tangles after using this, I had to cut my hair in about 4 places, down to about 1 inch. I know it&#x27;s this because that never happened before while I was using my other leave in. It is inferior to the Neutrogena leave in I use, so I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Did not detangle as good as promised! My conditioners did better!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product for those on a natural hair journey. It leaves your hair soft with defined curls and is non greasy to touch. I use it on dry or wet hair daily.</li>
    <li> I use this product on my very very tender headed son. It works like a dream. I used others products in the past and nothing compared to this.</li>
    <li> This is really great stuff! It takes all of the tangles out of your hair after washing, and mine is very thick! Also great for use when ever you need to detangle your hair, even if dry! Highly recommended!!!!</li>
    <li> REALLY stinky... kind of an unpleasantly strong soapy smell.  It does detangle but don&#x27;t like how hair feels after.  Have done much better with Miss Jessie products for daughter with long, fine curly hair.  And when her hair is properly conditioned, I&#x27;ve found the detanglers really aren&#x27;t needed!</li>
    <li> My gf bought this (from a local store) for our 8 mth old daughter curly hair ...the first use was great as the hair was extremely dry and tight it loosened it immediately only complaint was my gf hands were sticky afterwards (feels like it should be washed out of the hair like a treatment.)... but now it doesn&#x27;t work anymore... just dries out the hair.. she even tried it in her own hair which is the same texture as our daughter... same results.. unfortunate...but on a plus it smells really good.</li>
    <li> This product was thin, not luxurious, and did not detangle my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if my hair is too thick or coarse, but either way, after half of the bottle, on my first use, I gave up and used another product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not use or recommend this product for thicker hair.</li>
    <li> I recently did the big chop and ever since I&#x27;ve been natural, nothing has made my hair feel softer than this stuff right here. I had never heard of this brand until I was given a free sample at my local beauty supply. This product made the comb glide thru my 4B hair after washing. It was amazing! 3 days later, my hair is still soft and manageable. I love this product and I refuse to continue my natural hair journey without it. My hair was so dry and brittle and most products I used either left my hair too hard or too greasy. This did not. I barely have any residue on my hands when I touch my hair. I wash my hands like 4 times to get most products off. I am a satisfied customer. I will probably try more of Aunt Jackie&#x27;s products. Funny thing, I had an Aunt Jackie in my family too lol Anyways, I think its worth a try if you&#x27;re considering it. Some of the other reviews said that it is cheaper in store. I would suggest checking it out in your local beauty supply first. I just bought mines on here for $10. I guess I could have saved $3 but I got it in 2 days without making a trip. I guess I saved $3 on gas...</li>
    <li> my daughter love it !</li>
    <li> This is an amazing hair care product I have natural hair and once I apply it my washed hair after using the other Aunt Jackie&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner. It makes my hair super super soft and it&#x27;s an amazing hair detangling cream I would recommend this product along with all the rest of Aunt Jackie&#x27;s hair products to others.</li>
