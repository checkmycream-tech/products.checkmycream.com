### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I am very happy with the pumpkin peel and hydration serum</li>
      <li>One of the best tools for calming my Type 2 Rosacea.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been the blemish product that has worked best for me.</li>
      <li>And the greatest perk is not putting chemicals on my skin every day.  </li>
      <li>I use this product in conjunction with the Cranberry Cleanser, Fruit Enzyme Spray, Eye Brightener Cream, Perfect C Serum, and Grapefruit Lotion.</li>
      <li>This stuff works great!</li>
      <li>has THE best price on it with Subscribe &amp; Save.  </li>
      <li>Very impressed by this product.</li>
      <li>Antibiotics worked best, but had undesirable side-effects for a distance runner.  </li>
      <li>This serum is awesome.</li>
      <li>Good stuf!</li>
      <li>This stuff is great.</li>
      <li>I would be a happy camper.  </li>
      <li>The sample kit will relieve you of twenty-five bucks, but you get to try out a bunch of great products.  </li>
      <li>MyChelle is a great company.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Prior to this, I would have happily given it five stars.</li>
      <li>I have just bought this one week ago, and the result shows amazing!  </li>
      <li>This serum is AMAZING!</li>
      <li>It does not smell so good though,</li>
      <li>Although I loved the smell and feel of this product, it did not help my skin at all.  </li>
      <li>I started buying the products and have been using them with very satisfying results ever since.  </li>
      <li>I love it!  </li>
      <li>I never knew that a product like this existed, and I&#x27;m glad I decided to try it out!</li>
      <li>The results were amazing.  </li>
      <li>This product smells amazing...</li>
      <li>This product does NOT do that, and it is effective.</li>
      <li>I have also noticed that it keeps the rest of my face a nice even tone.</li>
      <li>All in all, about as effective as if they had just put water inside it.</li>
      <li>When I stopped using it and continued with the cleanser and peel, my skin cleared up nicely.  </li>
      <li>Now it is sticky almost to the point of being soapy, and is no longer effective for my acne-prone skin.  </li>
      <li>It is pretty good a product!</li>
      <li>This was also more scented than I would have liked.</li>
      <li>This is the most amazing serum ever.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an added bonus that MyChelle is an awesome eco-friendly and natural company, so I&#x27;m not worried about putting their ingredients on my skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this product and will stick with it for the rest of my life.</li>
      <li>I have referred many friends to this product, and we all can&#x27;t believe how well it</li>
      <li>its not an overwhelming scent, but even under my moisturizer I get whiffs of it throughout the day.</li>
      <li>He has tried many of the products out there.  </li>
      <li>My skin always feels and looks better after doing this lineup.  </li>
      <li>Really does a great job in clearing my face.</li>
      <li>But my blackheads haven&#x27;t gone away, and I&#x27;m getting more pimples than before I used it.</li>
      <li>I mix this with the perfect C serum for daily use.</li>
      <li>I love this serum because if I do get a blemish I apply this serum on it</li>
      <li>I love this line.  </li>
      <li>Better than benzyl peroxide, which can be drying and cause redness.  </li>
      <li>this works WAY better than anything I have tried.  </li>
      <li>My skin was doing better before using this product after I watched my diet</li>
      <li>I use it in the Bay Area at home on maintenance and LOVE it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gone off and on just to see if I&#x27;d like something even more</li>
      <li>and my skin has dramatically improved and looks so much better.</li>
      <li>Although I think having great skin is the result of a combination of healthy diet, sleep, stress management, and the right product picks, this serum has definitely been a great addition to my skincare regimen.</li>
      <li>I LOVED it and used it daily and found that it greatly reduced breakouts for me and smelled fabulous.  </li>
      <li>I am sure it is great for some people, but it has not been the exact right thing for him.  </li>
      <li>works great for adult acne</li>
      <li>I wish I had known the change was going to occur, I would have happily held onto my old bottle and refilled as necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The fact that my skin is clear and the cyst is healing quickly is great.</li>
      <li>Smells good but doesn&#x27;t do much else.</li>
      <li>When I follow the regimen for a while, my skin looks awesome- clearer than any other point in my life.  </li>
      <li>the texture is almost liquid and easily absorbs into skin.</li>
      <li>Not only does this system control the oil and whiteheads, it heals acne wounds beautifully.  </li>
      <li>Within 2 days I had a huge pimple on my chin.</li>
      <li>was using the Oil Free Grapefruit Cream before but found I couldn&#x27;t bear the perfumey smell.</li>
      <li>Wonderful waste of money.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s not tested on animals, which is important to me.</li>
      <li>the original formula was really, really fabulous.</li>
      <li>I began regularly applying this lightly to my skin after washing every night, plus a quick swipe in the morning, and I have been so happy with the results.</li>
      <li>i saw improvement after two days of serum use -- my face has not not been this great in a long time.</li>
      <li>I think it helps prevent breakouts and my makeup seems to go on better when I put this on first.</li>
      <li>But not surprised because of the great reviews.</li>
      <li>No smell, no weird residue on the face...seems to work, in that my skin mostly looks great (minus pre-mentrual days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I started to get some zits but not nearly as bad as before.</li>
      <li>right when it starts, preventing those HUGE unsightly zits and speeds up the healing process.</li>
      <li>The smell is a pretty strong patchouli scent that, thankfully, fades fairly quickly after applying.</li>
      <li>I read other reviews and heard great things, so i decided to give this a try.</li>
      <li>I have mild acne which seemed to worsen with this product.  </li>
      <li>I like the feel of this serum, it absorbs into the skin quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel oily or greasy.</li>
      <li>I will not purchase this again and have lowered my original star rating and deleted my stellar review.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s powerful stuff and Amazon (as of 3/11/2010)</li>
      <li>The ingredients lists Azelaic Acid which, after lots of research, seems to help many skin conditions including acne, and it&#x27;s a naturally found acid.     </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s totally worth the money.</li>
      <li>but I did no have much success with this serum.  </li>
      <li>I used this in combination with the Mychelle Perfect C serum [as their website said they increase the efficacy of each other] but my skin is no clearer, smoother, my pores no smaller, see no fewer breakouts.  </li>
      <li>It has the same excellent quality as other Mychelle products.  </li>
      <li>My husband&#x27;s skin is very sensitive and breaks out easily at any irritation.  </li>
      <li>I have seen a reduction in whiteheads and very large, blocked pores that hurt a lot.</li>
      <li>Also, generally my skin looks better, not just no acne.</li>
      <li>With this most recent purchase, the label is different and the serum smells and feels kind of sticky now.  </li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this stuff - love the natural list of ingredients - but I can&#x27;t see any difference in my skin at all.  </li>
      <li>won&#x27;t break the bank and it has enough to decide if it will help you or not :)</li>
      <li>THanks!</li>
      <li>This was the first purchase of this product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had mild/severe acne for 5 years now and have tried lots of things from salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and even Differin (but no insurance &#x3D; $130 per tube of Differin, which worked REALLY WELL!).</li>
      <li>Really, if you are struggling with finding a treatment for your acne the Mychelle product is worth a try.  </li>
      <li>Overall, don&#x27;t expect a miracle from this serum (or any skincare product, really), but if you have a penchant for natural products and need something that will aid other lifestyle choices in bettering your skin, this stuff is an awesome investment!</li>
      <li>I put a tiny tiny bit on my finger and the smell was so potent and strong I kept smelling it hours after washing my hands.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s how I found the Clear Skin Serum and other great stuff that I buy in full size bottles on a regular basis now.~</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll order this one other time because sometimes things do take 2 months to really become effective.</li>
      <li>I love it because it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to tell whether or not it is good at controlling oil.</li>
      <li>Update: 3 months of use, never noticed a single improvement.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really like the MyChelle cranberry cleanser and Pumpkin peel but I did no have much success with this serum.  I have mild acne which seemed to worsen with this product.  When I stopped using it and continued with the cleanser and peel, my skin cleared up nicely.  However, I like MyChelle products and don&#x27;t want to disuade others from using it, because it might work for certain types of acne.</li>
    <li> not very impressive for the amount of money i paid for this lotion...just made my face a little red with no results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no spring chick but still was breaking out - this was one of the few non-prescription items that I&#x27;ve used that really works.  I mix this with the perfect C serum for daily use.</li>
    <li> I have just bought this one week ago, and the result shows amazing!  My skin is quite oily with redness every day T_T   After using this serum every day (morning and night) for only a week, nearly all the redness has disapeared! My skin is not so oily as before.  It is pretty good a product!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the pumpkin peel and hydration serum so I really wanted to like this one. I have oily and sensitive skin. This product smells bad and made me break out around the chin area. I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to tell whether or not it is good at controlling oil.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my 16 year old son who struggles with acne.  He has tried many of the products out there.  Antibiotics worked best, but had undesirable side-effects for a distance runner.  (I don&#x27;t think they should be over-used anyway.)  I read previous reviews that suggested this product smells unpleasant, but he actually likes the smell and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s bad...a little earthy perhaps.  I am sure it is great for some people, but it has not been the exact right thing for him.  Also, I&#x27;m not sure how the price for such a small amount is justified. We&#x27;ll keep trying.</li>
    <li> My skin was doing better before using this product after I watched my diet but I do like this product. I think it helps prevent breakouts and my makeup seems to go on better when I put this on first. For me it&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> So I have been using this product for over a year now and it lasts a pretty long time so the bottle I last had was purchased quite some time ago.  I LOVED it and used it daily and found that it greatly reduced breakouts for me and smelled fabulous.  With this most recent purchase, the label is different and the serum smells and feels kind of sticky now.  I contacted the company and asked if they had changed the formula in addition to changing the packaging and they said no.  I swear it seems pretty different--unless something really bizarre has happened to my sense of smell, this is not the same product and truthfully, I like it less than I used to and have consequently been using it less. It may or may not be as effective still with regular use, but it seems I have fallen a little out of love with MyChelle Clear Skin Serum. . . alas!</li>
    <li> After receiving this product in a sampler pack, I was very skeptical that it would do anything for my skin. I have very regular light break outs around my chin and I had not found anything OTC to help. I began regularly applying this lightly to my skin after washing every night, plus a quick swipe in the morning, and I have been so happy with the results. It is not a miracle serum, and probably isn&#x27;t quite enough for those suffering from heavy acne, but I have noticed a significant drop in blemishes. Also, I feel it helps clear up acne right when it starts, preventing those HUGE unsightly zits and speeds up the healing process. The smell is a pretty strong patchouli scent that, thankfully, fades fairly quickly after applying. I have also noticed that it keeps the rest of my face a nice even tone. This product has become a crucial part of my daily routine and I highly recommend anyone with pesky blemishes try it.</li>
    <li> One week later, my major acne has disappeared. I have tried Dr. Brandt poreless line, Origins, Shiseido, and walked into Whole Foods, since I wanted to use natural skincare.  They recommended this, and I was very leery, but a week later, my zeets have disappeared!  I still have one or two, but I put this on, and a few days later, it disappears.  Does not work instantly, in one day, but for some reason, it works, and also makes my skin STOP producing so much oil on my forehead.  My forehead used to be oily by 11  am.  Now, my skin is regulated.  I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s inside that works, but for some reason it&#x27;s working.  I&#x27;m also using the fruit enzyme cleaner, but am going to look for another product. I&#x27;m disappointed that they store this stuff in cheap plastic containers that can leak carcinogenic chemicals (BPA, etc) into the facewash, and into our body.  If they would switch all their bottles to glass bottles that would not leech any chemicals...I would be a happy camper.  The clear skin serum does not come in a plastic bottle btw, thankfully.</li>
    <li> I read other reviews and heard great things, so i decided to give this a try. I&#x27;ve had mild/severe acne for 5 years now and have tried lots of things from salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and even Differin (but no insurance &#x3D; $130 per tube of Differin, which worked REALLY WELL!). The ingredients lists Azelaic Acid which, after lots of research, seems to help many skin conditions including acne, and it&#x27;s a naturally found acid.     After 3 weeks, it has kept my acne under control and it&#x27;s even helping with some of my old scars! I still get a pimple here and there but not as much as before and not the usual cystic pimples i used to get! I would definitely recommend this to others. The one thing I don&#x27;t like is the bottle itself. The pump squirts out way too fast and a couple of drops always end up somewhere across the bathroom no matter how careful you are...    All in all, I would say at to give it a try if you&#x27;re looking for something to help your acne, especially since buying 1 bottle won&#x27;t break the bank and it has enough to decide if it will help you or not :)</li>
    <li> When traveling in hot Asian countries recently and sweating all day long, I started using after washing face every single time I washed. I&#x27;d started doing only once a day but got these terrible breakouts at the hairline. Once I was using it 2-3x/day the hairline breakouts went away. I use it in the Bay Area at home on maintenance and LOVE it. No smell, no weird residue on the face...seems to work, in that my skin mostly looks great (minus pre-mentrual days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using the Oil Free Grapefruit Cream before but found I couldn&#x27;t bear the perfumey smell. It also just didn&#x27;t seem to work as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this in conjuction with mychelle white cranberry cleanser and oil free grapefruit cream. Has definitely helped my acne, and leaves skin moisturized without the oily effect. Will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> One of the best tools for calming my Type 2 Rosacea. I can not live without this product in my life nor can my face. THanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this about 2 months.  When I first started I had a serious breakout of cystic acne.  I&#x27;m 51 and in peri-menopause.  So this was hormonal.  Took about 2 weeks to finish clearing up my skin.  My skin stayed clear for about 2 months and I scaled back my usage to once a day or every other day.  Recently I had another cyst show up.  I dabbed it immediately with the serum and started using it 2x per day again.  The breakout stayed minimal.  Didn&#x27;t get as inflamed or large or painful as usual and NO OTHER CYSTS appeared.  That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m writing this review.  Usually, if I get 1 i get several.  The fact that my skin is clear and the cyst is healing quickly is great. I will continue to use this product.  Also, generally my skin looks better, not just no acne.</li>
    <li> Although I think having great skin is the result of a combination of healthy diet, sleep, stress management, and the right product picks, this serum has definitely been a great addition to my skincare regimen. I&#x27;ve been using it for about three months, and while I still have blemishes (due to being a little bit lazy with those other factors, I&#x27;m guessing!), the overall texture of my skin and scarring from old marks have noticeably improved. It&#x27;s an added bonus that MyChelle is an awesome eco-friendly and natural company, so I&#x27;m not worried about putting their ingredients on my skin. Overall, don&#x27;t expect a miracle from this serum (or any skincare product, really), but if you have a penchant for natural products and need something that will aid other lifestyle choices in bettering your skin, this stuff is an awesome investment!</li>
    <li> THIS IS AN UPDATE 1/24/2011:  Since my original review last year, Mychelle seems to have reformulated this serum.  It now has a soapy, sticky feel to it that wasn&#x27;t there before and leaves my skin feeling tight and dry afterward to the point of requiring moisturizer.  I have yet to find a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or cause breakouts, so this defeats the purpose of the Clear Skin Serum.  I will not purchase this again and have lowered my original star rating and deleted my stellar review. So sad.... the original formula was really, really fabulous. And the zit zapping quest resumes. Sigh.al antibiotic I was prescribed.  Unfortunately, several weeks after finishing the antibiotic I saw signs of the infection returning.  I thought, hey I basically have zits in my pits (YUCK) why don&#x27;t I try the Clear Skin Serum on it?  Guess what?  Worked like a charm.  Infection conquered.  My dermatologist seemed amused, not to mention skeptical... but docs always seem skeptical about outside of the box treatments.    It&#x27;s powerful stuff and Amazon (as of 3/11/2010) has THE best price on it with Subscribe &amp; Save.  Really, if you are struggling with finding a treatment for your acne the Mychelle product is worth a try.  It might work for you as well as it did for me and many of the other people who have written reviews.    It is also worth noting that you can find Mychelle sample kits online for different skin types and one of the kits is for Oily/Acne skin.  The sample kit will relieve you of twenty-five bucks, but you get to try out a bunch of great products.  It&#x27;s enough to last a week or so.  That&#x27;s how I found the Clear Skin Serum and other great stuff that I buy in full size bottles on a regular basis now.~</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I&#x27;ve been using it now for 2 weeks and my acne I had for years is almost gone. I&#x27;m so glad I found this product and will stick with it for the rest of my life. If you are suffering from acne and sensitive skin like me, give this product a try. It&#x27;s totally worth the money.</li>
    <li> I just got my second bottle of this, and I was surprised to find a new style to the bottle and the pump! The pump seems to loosen from the glass bottle more easily than the previous one did, I am tightening that topper just about every other day. And I&#x27;m not pleased with this pump, it squirts the product out at a harder (faster?) velocity, so I lose a few drops due to scatter/bounce each time. It&#x27;s harder to get a half-pump out in this way, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t be so concerned about losing a drop here or there except this stuff is expensive and worth every penny! As long as I&#x27;m consistent with it, it takes care of and even prevents those nasty hormonal jawline/neck breakouts. I wish I had known the change was going to occur, I would have happily held onto my old bottle and refilled as necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to this, I would have happily given it five stars.</li>
    <li> I use this product in conjunction with the Cranberry Cleanser, Fruit Enzyme Spray, Eye Brightener Cream, Perfect C Serum, and Grapefruit Lotion. I love it because it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. It seems to work well, but it&#x27;s definitely not magic - it takes time. I have seen a reduction in whiteheads and very large, blocked pores that hurt a lot. It&#x27;s been the blemish product that has worked best for me. In the past I&#x27;ve tried Tea Tree Oil from The Body Shop, Burt&#x27;s Bees blemish roll-on stick, and various drugstore products, none of which have worked well.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product a little over a year now.  I love it!  5 years ago I started getting adult acne.  Never had acne in my life.  I wasn&#x27;t sure what to do, so I struggled through Mary Kay, Clinique and several other products before stumbling across Mychelle in a Health Food Store.  I tried the little sample kit for oily/acne skin.  The results were amazing.  I started buying the products and have been using them with very satisfying results ever since.  I love this serum because if I do get a blemish I apply this serum on it and it sometimes will make it completely disappear overnight and other times it may take a day or two to disappear, but it works quickly.  The other thing I have noticed is Mychelle products restore my skin in the acne areas.  I was getting little areas with \\&quot;pock marks\\&quot;.  But, now my skin looks younger and smoother.  My husband even comments about how clear my face is.  I suggest whoever is looking for an acne treatment, buy Mychelles travel/sample kit and try it out for yourself.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great! It does not smell so good though, guess it&#x27;s because of the witch hazel, that&#x27;s the main ingredient. But it works well to control oil. I use it at night and under my make up during the day. A little goes a long way :-)</li>
    <li> My face has always had small acne problems. Nothing that&#x27;s too horrible, but enough that I get annoyed. This serum is AMAZING! It tightens up the pores and makes any visible blemishes reduce before your eyes. I never knew that a product like this existed, and I&#x27;m glad I decided to try it out!</li>
    <li> This was the first purchase of this product.  It has the same excellent quality as other Mychelle products.  This is a line of products that I trust.</li>
    <li> This product smells amazing...kinda hippish, like patchouli. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t think it does much. I put it on at night to help repair the skin and keep breakouts at bay but it didn&#x27;t do much as far as clearing the skin. Smells good but doesn&#x27;t do much else. Won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> I used this religiously for a month and saw no change in my acne or oil production. But that&#x27;s just me. This was also more scented than I would have liked. the texture is almost liquid and easily absorbs into skin.</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing serum ever. I wish I had it years ago.  I have referred many friends to this product, and we all can&#x27;t believe how well it works.&lt;br /&gt;When I feel a pimple forming, I put this product on 2-3 times day. It stops the pimple from growing without irrating or drying out my skin.</li>
    <li> This serum is awesome. I&#x27;ve been using it faithfully for years now along with the white cranberry cleanser. It has completely eliminated my monthly breakouts on my chin. I recently ran out and lagged on ordering a new bottle. Within 2 days I had a huge pimple on my chin. I told my husband I will never allow myself to run out again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the prescription meds for my acne and they help.  But I can&#x27;t put my face near fabric because those products bleach.  But just recently I read the labels on the prescription creams and they are loaded with toxic junk: methyparabens and such.      I love this line.  When I follow the regimen for a while, my skin looks awesome- clearer than any other point in my life.  I&#x27;ve gone off and on just to see if I&#x27;d like something even more that&#x27;s a bit cheaper and I have not.  I use the cranberry cleanser, then the clear skin serum, and finish with the pumpkin renew cream.  My skin always feels and looks better after doing this lineup.  Best part: if I do it for a few weeks straight, missing a week doesn&#x27;t seem to mess my skin up again!!    And the greatest perk is not putting chemicals on my skin every day.  MyChelle is a great company.  I&#x27;ve spoken to customer service once because of a bad shipment from this site, not theirs, and they fixed the problem for me, no charge!!</li>
    <li> Although I loved the smell and feel of this product, it did not help my skin at all.  In fact, I think it made my skin worse.  I used the whole Oily/Breakout prone system for about 4 months, but it only made my skin worse.  I finally switched to a different brand face wash and moisturizer (that&#x27;s it, no serums, toners, etc.) and my skin has dramatically improved and looks so much better.</li>
    <li> Buy the entire 6 products for oily/blemished skin.  It works!!! Fighting whiteheads for decades. Not only does this system control the oil and whiteheads, it heals acne wounds beautifully.  Highly recommend.  Been using the system for 4 months.</li>
    <li> i NEVER leave product reviews but could not leave this secret potion unrated -- i have struggled with my complexion for months and tried numerous products. i saw improvement after two days of serum use -- my face has not not been this great in a long time. i recommend the entire mychelle product line.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate that so many people around me don&#x27;t like the scent of patchouli since this smelled so strongly like it. I wish I had never purchased this. It not only did not improve my skin, it made it worse with cystic acne only to the areas that I had applied this. Guess for some it works, just not for me.</li>
    <li> works great for adult acne</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve this product a month before I decided to review it - my skin isn&#x27;t any better than when I started, possibly even worse. This doesn&#x27;t soothe and calm any red skin. The bottle is tiny and you have to very frugle with the pump because every pump costs you 25 cents. All in all, about as effective as if they had just put water inside it. Unfortunate because I had held out hope for this. I&#x27;ll order this one other time because sometimes things do take 2 months to really become effective. If the second bottle improves my skin, I&#x27;ll remove this review. If not, I&#x27;ll keep it up.    Update: 3 months of use, never noticed a single improvement. In fact, the serum wound up making my skin feel perpetually tight and dry, causing it to be MORE red. Wonderful waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have used EVERY acne treatment including proactive and this works WAY better than anything I have tried.  Warning!!!  It stinks and people will smell it on you.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this stuff - love the natural list of ingredients - but I can&#x27;t see any difference in my skin at all.  I used this in combination with the Mychelle Perfect C serum [as their website said they increase the efficacy of each other] but my skin is no clearer, smoother, my pores no smaller, see no fewer breakouts.  I wish I could report different results!</li>
    <li> I used MyChelle Clear Skin Serum almost daily for over 5 years.  I&#x27;ve never had issues with serious acne, but I would get unpleasant bumps along my jaw line, and hairline, and would get a few pimples from time-to-time (especially during THAT time of the month).  This serum cleared up the bumps and would prevent me from getting any pimples, no matter what my hormones were doing.  I haven&#x27;t been using it as much for the last year or so, as my skin seems to have changed a bit and I don&#x27;t have the same issues I used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin tends to be on the dry side, and is easily irritated.  This serum never caused any irritation. One bottle can last me close to a year with nearly daily applications to my face.  I wasn&#x27;t applying it to my neck, and I put on a very thin layer.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, and this is gentle enough to use often if needed.  Better than benzyl peroxide, which can be drying and cause redness.  This product does NOT do that, and it is effective.</li>
    <li> This serum really helped both my husband and me with our skin.  My husband&#x27;s skin is very sensitive and breaks out easily at any irritation.  This helped clear his skin up pretty much completely.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month now. I lovelovelove the way it smells. But my blackheads haven&#x27;t gone away, and I&#x27;m getting more pimples than before I used it. I am also using the Cranberry face wash, the fruit enzyme mist toner, and the pumpkin renewal cream. Maybe the cream is too heavy for my skin, so I might try the clear skin moisturizer next.</li>
    <li> Good stuf! Have a subscription to this it works!&lt;br /&gt;I suffer  from adult acne and this product has kept my breakouts at bay. A little expensive, however, worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have been using Mychelle products since May because I needed to clear up my skin for my wedding and I was going to pay the price. I&#x27;ve always had problems with acne and nothing really worked, including Murad (even though it certainly helped). After about one month of using the whole acne/oily line from Mychelle (I got the sample pack for about $20), my face cleared up!!!!!!!!! Well I ran out of the small sample of vitamin C serum and I started to get some zits but not nearly as bad as before. Of course, the serum is expensive about $40 so I had to wait to buy it. Once, I did buy it, I noticed my skin started to clear up again and I haven&#x27;t really had problems since. I think the vitamin C serum works so well with the rest of the products.</li>
    <li> Very impressed by this product. But not surprised because of the great reviews. Really does a great job in clearing my face. Still get an occasional zit and some teeny tiny ones here and there. But its not a problem. I&#x27;ve tried every OTC product including Proactiv and this stuff beats thema all.</li>
    <li> Sadly, this made me break out really bad :(  Too bad, seemed like THE dream product for acne sufferers.  I have moderate to severe acne that has calmed waaaay down since I started taking YAZ.. That is, until I used this serum. I will go back to using Juice Beauty Blemish Serum which doesn&#x27;t exactly clear my face up, but does reduce redness on contact and definitely heals the pimples much quicker when used in conjunction with BP.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try Mychelle&#x27;s whole line of acne/oily products as well as some of the other products and I found all of them to be defective. My breakouts did not go away, and when I specifically started using this serum my forehead broke out in a mass of pimples! I never get that. I am very disappointed with the results. Also, this serum smells HORRIBLE! I put a tiny tiny bit on my finger and the smell was so potent and strong I kept smelling it hours after washing my hands.</li>
    <li> MyChelle changed the formulation of this product several years ago, removing the lactic acid (derived from milk, if I understand correctly), and the product has not been the same since.  It used to be not the least bit sticky, and was highly effective.  Now it is sticky almost to the point of being soapy, and is no longer effective for my acne-prone skin.  I respect the effort to make this product completely vegan, but unfortunately, for me, it compromised the product.</li>
    <li> I like the idea of what the product is supposed to do. I like it being free of all the harsh chemicals found in drug store brands and it&#x27;s not tested on animals, which is important to me. I like the feel of this serum, it absorbs into the skin quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel oily or greasy. It makes my skin feel more tight after application. I have really clear skin and I bought this as an under coat to my daily moisturizer with sunscreen. It doesn&#x27;t appear to be giving me acne, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to prevent small blemishes from popping up here and there. I guess I would see a bigger difference if my skin was worse. the only complaint I have is it has Patchouli in it.  Which is not listed on the product description on Amazon, but is listed on the box it came in. i hate patchouli and it smells a little like a dirty hippy. its not an overwhelming scent, but even under my moisturizer I get whiffs of it throughout the day. if you&#x27;re sensitive to the that smell, i would steer clear of this.</li>
