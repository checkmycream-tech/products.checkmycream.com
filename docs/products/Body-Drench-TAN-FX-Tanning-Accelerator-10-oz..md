      <li>It says for experienced tanners ....</li>
      <li>AMAZING!</li>
      <li>Works great, has good scent.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>Smells good, it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
      <li>the smell is good &amp; &amp;#34;islandy&amp;#34; (think pina colada &amp; coconut)</li>
      <li>I bought it upon reading a good review and very glad I did.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love it!  </li>
      <li>The smell is why I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, for sure!</li>
      <li>order again as soon as I need more!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always liked body drench lotion</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t care for strong fragrances and this smells great, very mild and pleasant.</li>
      <li>I LIKED IT</li>
      <li>I would recommend splurging on a better product for a deeper tan</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to get a tan before.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>It does inhance your tan more than no lotion at all.</li>
      <li>Love the results in the tanning bed.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>i love this lotion</li>
      <li>Love everything about this but the smell.</li>
      <li>When you smell it in the bottle it isn&#x27;t great, kind of coconut mixed with something.</li>
      <li>Great smell that leaves my skin soft.</li>
      <li>i would recommend to anyone that tans easily &amp; doesn&#x27;t want bronzers, tingle or heat.</li>
      <li>Body Drench FX.&lt;br /&gt;It have nice scent and really make me tann.</li>
      <li>I saw results after one use, they weren&#x27;t dramatic, but anything on a real fair skinned person is amazing after just one use.</li>
      <li>this is an older version of lotion, although it does smell nice and doesnt lave you smelling like you have just went tanning.  </li>
      <li>so I was excited to see a tanning lotion line</li>
      <li>the after tanning scent, but if you shower right after or reapply the lotion, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>SO MUCH THAT I PURCHASED 4 MORE BOTTLES.</li>
      <li>well 20 years of tanning is good enough for me</li>
      <li>After using it several times a week, I&#x27;ve now gotten some good tan from lying out in the sun about 30 mins a day and using this product.</li>
      <li>You see results after 1 session, and it builds a tan quickly after that.</li>
      <li>Not as good as the original Body Drench Accelerator, harder to apply as well.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased to see that this lotion is white, not brown!</li>
      <li>No fake bronzers here and no orange skin!</li>
      <li>Worth every dollar.</li>
      <li>i tan very easily with just about any kind of lotion (even regular) but this non-greasy lotion seems to bring out a deeper &amp; longer lasting tan that develops quicker than normal.</li>
      <li>and I really noticed the difference.  </li>
      <li>But I dont really feel like this did anything.</li>
      <li>A LITTLE MORE OUT.I WILL CONTINUE TO BUY</li>
      <li>It does what it says and gives you a nice, dark brown tan!!!</li>
      <li>Being pretty fair skinned, I was skeptical about this products claim, \\&quot;you will see results after one use\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>Not sure what they put in the lotion, but am sure that it is not a self tanner.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty pale, but I needed to get tan quick.</li>
      <li>I do like the fact that it really helps increase the amount of tan I can get in the same amount of time.</li>
      <li>Skin is sensitive.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t all slimy and it doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy after use, it leaves your skin so soft and hydrated.</li>
      <li>When i got this item in the mail the packaging was too big and the cap of the lotion was opened most likely due to shipping the item and some of it squirt out...</li>
      <li>I usually don&#x27;t tan easily, but I saw results immediately when using this accelerator.  </li>
      <li>Its not a very smooth lotion and the smell is kind of weird like chemicals but not very strong at all which is nice</li>
      <li>AS MY LITTLE SECRET TO A GREAT LOOKING TAN.</li>
      <li>im not very dark</li>
      <li>The product isn&#x27;t overly smelly like most of the lotions they sell in the salon, which is a big plus for me, it smells subtle like a moisturizer to me.</li>

<li> the only negative i have is that it doesn&#x27;t really do anything to mask</li>
<li> And I was just looking for something to give me a good base tan becase</li>
<li> I have been tanning a long time and since I have been using this, I only spend half the amount of time tanning, and as dark as I would have been by late August.</li>
<li> This stuff does work for its low price-but it smells pretty bad and leaves you oily and greasy.</li>
<li> The one time I used it, it wasn&#x27;t noticeable and definitely not worth the price you pay by stinking.</li>
<li> so after you tan its still not strong.</li>
<li> Got this as it doesn&#x27;t have bronzers, but it smelled a bit off, so not sure of quality/age.</li>
<li> Not sure about how it works as an accelerator because I can&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to find indoor tanning products these days that don&#x27;t contain bronzers.</li>
<li> Not impressed with performance moisturising-wise.</li>
<li> This tanning lotion smells bad.  </li>
<li> I am definitely disappointed.</li>
<li> But once it is on your body it smells NASTY.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m pretty pale, but I needed to get tan quick. This stuff works. You see results after 1 session, and it builds a tan quickly after that. AMAZING!</li>
    <li> It does inhance your tan more than no lotion at all. It doesn&#x27;t have an odor and it does not stain your hands or leave them slimey.</li>
    <li> Being pretty fair skinned, I was skeptical about this products claim, \\&quot;you will see results after one use\\&quot;. I am a skeptic no longer! I saw results after one use, they weren&#x27;t dramatic, but anything on a real fair skinned person is amazing after just one use. After using it several times a week, I&#x27;ve now gotten some good tan from lying out in the sun about 30 mins a day and using this product. I&#x27;ve never been able to get a tan before. Thankfully, I read about the product on a forum, and now I am a customer for life!    Thankfully, this product has no bronzer in it, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about streaks of orange and rust color. The product isn&#x27;t overly smelly like most of the lotions they sell in the salon, which is a big plus for me, it smells subtle like a moisturizer to me. It isn&#x27;t all slimy and it doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy after use, it leaves your skin so soft and hydrated. Try it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find indoor tanning products these days that don&#x27;t contain bronzers. I want to look tan, not orange like an oompa loompa! I was very pleased to see that this lotion is white, not brown! No fake bronzers here and no orange skin! It does what it says and gives you a nice, dark brown tan!!!</li>
    <li> THIS IS A EXCELLENT PRODUCT. YOU WILL SEE RESULTS AFTER 1 USE. I LIKED IT SO MUCH THAT I PURCHASED 4 MORE BOTTLES. BOTH MY DAUGHTERS USE IT AS WELL. HAS A GREAT SCENT. THE ONLY THING I DIDNT LIKE WAS THE AMOUNT OF LOTION PER PUMP. I WISH IT PUMPED A LITTLE MORE OUT.I WILL CONTINUE TO BUY IT.I ALMOST WANT TO KEEP IT AS MY LITTLE SECRET TO A GREAT LOOKING TAN.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  This is my 3rd bottle this summer...I tan in the sun, not in a booth.  Keeps my tan heatlhy looking longer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used an accelerator before and I am quite impressed!  1 tanning session and I really noticed the difference.  I don&#x27;t care for strong fragrances and this smells great, very mild and pleasant.</li>
    <li> I have been tanning a long time and since I have been using this, I only spend half the amount of time tanning, and as dark as I would have been by late August. Not sure what they put in the lotion, but am sure that it is not a self tanner. It simply WORKS! I bought it upon reading a good review and very glad I did. Worth every dollar.</li>
    <li> It says for experienced tanners ....well 20 years of tanning is good enough for me and this didn&#x27;t do a thing to my tan. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again or reccomend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This stuff does work for its low price-but it smells pretty bad and leaves you oily and greasy. Just take a shower after. I would recommend splurging on a better product for a deeper tan</li>
    <li> Very good tanning lotion.  Great smell that leaves my skin soft.</li>
    <li> When i got this item in the mail the packaging was too big and the cap of the lotion was opened most likely due to shipping the item and some of it squirt out... This tanning lotion doesnt work at all!... Ive tried to give it a chance for a week but i saw no results.</li>
    <li> I had wanted to have a darker tann but somehow didnt make it till I tried Body Drench FX.&lt;br /&gt;It have nice scent and really make me tann. Going to get another bottom for my partner.</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion smells bad.  I do like the fact that it really helps increase the amount of tan I can get in the same amount of time.</li>
    <li> Product did not work for me I saw no results AT ALL, ive been going for 1 week and 4days..5 times and this IS only a moisterizer, not am accelerator</li>
    <li> This stuff smells sooo gross! I am definitely disappointed. I only used it once and it might as well be thrown away. When you smell it in the bottle it isn&#x27;t great, kind of coconut mixed with something. But once it is on your body it smells NASTY. I kept thinking I smelled puke, and it was me!! Not sure about how it works as an accelerator because I can&#x27;t get past the smell. The one time I used it, it wasn&#x27;t noticeable and definitely not worth the price you pay by stinking. I would not recommend to anyone. Guess that&#x27;s what you get for buying a product like this online. Yuck.</li>
    <li> Got this as it doesn&#x27;t have bronzers, but it smelled a bit off, so not sure of quality/age. Not impressed with performance moisturising-wise. The smell is why I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, for sure!</li>
    <li> i love this lotion &amp; i&#x27;ve purchased it several times. i tan very easily with just about any kind of lotion (even regular) but this non-greasy lotion seems to bring out a deeper &amp; longer lasting tan that develops quicker than normal. the smell is good &amp; &amp;#34;islandy&amp;#34; (think pina colada &amp; coconut) the only negative i have is that it doesn&#x27;t really do anything to mask the after tanning scent, but if you shower right after or reapply the lotion, it&#x27;s fine. i would recommend to anyone that tans easily &amp; doesn&#x27;t want bronzers, tingle or heat.</li>
    <li> this is an older version of lotion, although it does smell nice and doesnt lave you smelling like you have just went tanning.  This is not a Bronzer.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it!  Works great, has good scent.&lt;br /&gt;Will order again as soon as I need more! May order for a friend!</li>
    <li> Being that this is just an accelerator it is just white so no bronzers. Its not a very smooth lotion and the smell is kind of weird like chemicals but not very strong at all which is nice so after you tan its still not strong. And I was just looking for something to give me a good base tan becase im not very dark so I could work my way up to bronzers without looking orange. But I dont really feel like this did anything.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the original Body Drench Accelerator, harder to apply as well.</li>
    <li> Love everything about this but the smell.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Can&#x27;t use a lot of lotions. Skin is sensitive. Love the results in the tanning bed.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t tan easily, but I saw results immediately when using this accelerator.  Its a great product for beginning tanners!</li>
    <li> Smells good, it&#x27;s not greasy. I&#x27;ve always liked body drench lotion so I was excited to see a tanning lotion line</li>
