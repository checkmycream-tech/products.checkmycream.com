<li> If you put too much water, creme, or secret weapon then the hair will sag down and /or turn really crunchy.  </li>

    <li> I love this cream. It controls the curls and it looks glossy. It&#x27;s durable too, just a small amount is necessary to cover all hair. I strongly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is similar to the old &amp;#34;Bryell? Cream&amp;#34;. Does a nice job of controlling fine &amp;#34;fly-away&amp;#34; hair.</li>
    <li> The first time I bought this it was fine, the second time I purchased this it was runny.  The Paul Mitchell website, www.paulmitchell.com, describes &amp;#34;Diversion&amp;#34; products and states that Paul Mitchell products are only sold at salons.  I didn&#x27;t return it and it is useable but not any where near the quality of the product when I bought it at a salon.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner!</li>
    <li> Great product. A little on the expensive side but worth it.</li>
    <li> I swim everyday and the chlorine burns my hair to a crisp, this conditioner offsets the damage and does not feel like glue</li>
    <li> This leave-in conditioner is so moisturizing, even after the fantastic moisturizer in the shower. My hair is so damaged from a years worth of &amp;#34;curl enhancing&amp;#34; products that it is time to repair and heal. This product will definitely help. Recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It gives my curls definition without stickiness.  But the packaging was really disappointing.  It was wrapped in a plastic bag and heavily taped.  Obviously they knew it would leak, and it did....heavily.  I had to clean the tube...but the worst part is how much product was wasted.  At least two weeks worth given the amount i use each day.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time. The price was very good. It makes my hair shiny and easy to manage</li>
    <li> I liked this product at first, but it really is too expensive to suit my needs. Also, the consistency of it is not that great; I was looking for something more smoothing for the dollar. I like trying different hair products, and this one just didn&#x27;t do it right for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to buy this item in the store so my husband had me order 4 to stock up. He swears by this and refuses to try anything else, not even in the Paul Mitchell line.</li>
    <li> Not sticky like others</li>
    <li> This is the only creme that works in my husbands hair, and he is very particular about what he puts in his hair.. - 5 STARS</li>
    <li> Great conditioner that leaves hair soft and a perfect hold without the stiffness!</li>
    <li> Best leave in conditioner I&#x27;ve found so far</li>
    <li> Awesome product came fast</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  My hair is long and dry and it really helps moisturize it.  This is a leave in conditioner which helps in combing my wet hair.  Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This Product is not original, This is complete waste of my money. I really want my money to be refunded.</li>
    <li> Awesome for curly hair people.  If you don&#x27;t dig the frizz, this is it.  It&#x27;s leave on conditioner, and my hair is SUPER happy with it.  I get my hair wet (but not dripping), then put a little bit and spread it on my hands.  Spread it on the hair evenly.  I then put on Frizz Ease Secret Weapon - it helps act like a very soft gel so i can style it.  No frizz, sweet look.  If you put too much water, creme, or secret weapon then the hair will sag down and /or turn really crunchy.  Play with it to balance it out.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and I would safely say my hair &amp;#34;can&#x27;t live without it&amp;#34;.  I use this instead of conditioner when I wash my hair.  A little dab of it worked through tames my thin hair and leaves it fuller (more volume).  The product is hard to find in my area so I&#x27;m just going to order it from Amazon in the future (a tube lasts for a good long while).</li>
    <li> It smells bad.  It must be an old tube because it never used to smell like that.  Would have appreciated a newer tube.</li>
    <li> My bf uses this stuff and SWEARS by it.  It&#x27;s all he will use for 4 years now... pshhh wheres my ring?  Note: still a bf :-P</li>
    <li> This is one of the best hair styling products I have eve tried to control frizzy hair! I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing Paul Mitchell&#x27;s The Cr&amp;egrave;me going on 30 years.  This product sold by All About Beauty is not The Cr&amp;egrave;me.  The true product is white and very smooth. This product is on the cream color side and slightly gloppy.  I will continue to use it, however, next time I will be aware of the vendor and make sure they are selling the true product, not a fake.  If it&#x27;s not Paul Mitchell&#x27;s, it&#x27;s not worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple years. I don&#x27;t use conditioner but instead I put &amp;#34;the Cream&amp;#34; on my damp hair. I like the fullness and shine it gives my hair.  Hey, if it makes this 60 year old look good it had to be great!</li>
    <li> Great styling product.</li>
