      <li>Once you get it all together bolt wise you presumably place the chair on top of the pneumatic pump and stand.  </li>
      <li>Nice product for the price</li>
      <li>I just kind of had to wing it</li>
      <li>It pumps and deflates nicely.</li>
      <li>the instruction Manuel isn&#x27;t very detailed at all</li>
      <li>If i could give more stars I WOULD.</li>
      <li>I love this chair</li>
      <li>We are satisfied with our purchase.</li>
      <li>I love it and will recommend it for anyone .</li>
      <li>I also LOVE the fact that the foot pedal doesn&#x27;t rack my clients in the ankles every time I turn the chair around for them to view their hair in a mirror  </li>
      <li>LOVE IT</li>
      <li>The swivel is smooth and nice.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy it!</li>
      <li>The hydraulic pump is just okay.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not like I can tell a grown up to sit on a booster :).</li>
      <li>It looks good, it works fine, its pretty easy to put together, its comfortable.</li>
      <li>This chair was easy to put together</li>
      <li>It easily scratches from buttons, zippers, etc.</li>
      <li>Easy to set up, once you understand the instruction sheet.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Me: &amp;#34;The chair does not work fine.</li>
      <li>From what it seems, the chair works fine</li>
      <li>Did not come with any sort of detailed instructions on how to put it together.  </li>
      <li>Such a great chair.</li>
      <li>It was delivered quickly.</li>
      <li>Just what I been looking for came fast in was so easy to put together</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t - I would strongly recommend to get someone to help you, because you could possibly rip the upholstery or strip a fitting and damage</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>It was worth our money.</li>
      <li>My husband and laughed and wondered if they forgot the other 7 pages.&lt;br /&gt;Overall.</li>
      <li>Came in about 3 days right before Christmas.</li>
      <li>When I went to it through the link in my order history it went right to it, but Omwah now has it listed as  &amp;#34;Currently unavailable.</li>
      <li>The shipping was right on schedule.</li>
      <li>Other than that i am happy with my chair thus far.</li>
      <li>This makes the chair look crooked, defective and cheap!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted</li>
      <li>Also the arm rests have to be screwed into where the zipper zips and this could potentially ruin the zipper very quickly.  </li>
      <li>The buyer should not be responsible for return shipping.&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>The silver bolts holding everything together were put through slots they cut in the fabric and they are at very drastic angles not perpetual...</li>
      <li>so it looks straight, but it works.</li>
      <li>The buyer should not be responsible for a restocking fee.</li>
      <li>And here is really the deal breaker</li>
      <li>As I originally stated, my teenage children have difficulty getting it to perform these tasks.</li>
      <li>Since the chair is not defective and is a brand new chair, as our policy states, the buyer is responsible for return shipping</li>
      <li>LOVE that this chair lowers enough so I can be above my clients</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for the most basic of basic salon chairs, this&#x27;ll do.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>It is positioned way to high.</li>
      <li>But the hydraulic lift doesn&#x27;t go to high..</li>
      <li>all my clients say how comfortable it is compared to other salon chairs I would buy it again</li>
      <li>I paid for a new chair, NOT a refurbished chair.</li>
      <li>Inc: &amp;#34;We sent you a brand new chair.</li>
      <li>The chair does not perform like a brand new chair.</li>
      <li>we can send you a new pump to replace that one.</li>
      <li>I paid for a new chair, not refurbished.</li>
      <li>#34;Your product was advertised as NEW.</li>
      <li>(they won&#x27;t let me do 0) and will take the loss and find some new chairs.</li>
      <li>The instructions are not useful in anyway, but if you have a bit of practical knowledge on fixing things or assembly you will be fine.  </li>
      <li>it was easy to get it together although my hubby did that in less than 20 mins.</li>
      <li>Requires minimal tool usage, seeing as most things simply slide together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>First there is some rust just starting on the chrome of the foot-rest.</li>
      <li>I told you from the very beginning that it acted like it did not have hydraulic fluid and the chair sticks, scrapes and scrubs when it goes up/</li>
      <li>Far as putting together my husband stated \\&quot;it was a piece of cake</li>
      <li>therefore if you would like to ship the chair back to us, you would need to place it back in original shipping inside and out and send it back to us at 1110 West 17th St Vancouver WA 98660.There</li>
      <li>i like it but is hard to swivel on lowest level,just pump up once and swivels fine</li>
      <li>Second, the ability to turn the chair while a client is seated, is becoming harder and harder.</li>
      <li>Fourthly, the vinyl used is to soft and rubbery.</li>
      <li>#34;That fixed the pump/release issue, but NOT THE LACK OF HYDRAULIC FLUID.</li>

<li> The most disappointing aspect are the cushions.</li>
<li> You took your $109 chair with negative reviews because of the defect, relisted it at a higher price without the negative reviews, to continue to manipulate people into buying your defective product as new and refurbishing it at the consumers labor.</li>

<li> Was complicated at first, trying to assemble it, because the instructions were on one page.</li>
<li> No leaking oils (as some of the other reviews stated)</li>
<li> The chair still sticks, scrapes and scrubs when it goes up/down and is turned, even after the bar was installed on the other side.</li>
<li> When you offer to send me replacement parts for a brand new item, you are admitting you falsely advertised your product and are trying to coerce me to accept a refurbished product.</li>
<li> I would have given it 5 stars if I didn&#x27;t have such a hard time putting the arms on the chair</li>
<li> it works good,was alittle hard to assemble but we finally got it put together.</li>
<li> At first glance, the chair in basic black isn&#x27;t bad looking in a utilitarian sort of way.</li>
<li> It turns around and pumps up and down.</li>
<li> although there is some stiffness when putting the chair up and down.</li>
<li> Me: &amp;#34;Hydraulics installed upside down with no grease/oil.</li>
<li> It should not be easier to move a piano than it is to pump the chair up, make it go down or turn.  </li>
<li> down and is turned.</li>
<li> I used to have to ask them to slouch down in my chair to take the pressure off my shoulders.  </li>
<li> Heavy chair looks like a $500 plus chair.</li>
<li> also looked at a few YouTube videos,</li>
<li> , it took me a few times to do it without lowering the chair as well.  </li>
<li> Chair is missing pieces.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Just what I been looking for came fast in was so easy to put together I will be ordering from them again</li>
    <li> We are satisfied with our purchase. Was complicated at first, trying to assemble it, because the instructions were on one page. My husband and laughed and wondered if they forgot the other 7 pages.&lt;br /&gt;Overall. It was worth our money. Easy to set up, once you understand the instruction sheet.&lt;br /&gt;My husband is a barber and we bought this for his barber shop. We are happy!</li>
    <li> Only rated 4stars because when i took the chair out the box to assemble it tge rubber grip around the base was broken. Other than that i am happy with my chair thus far.</li>
    <li> Chair is absolutely amazing &amp; sturdy! I&#x27;m a hair srylist and was in need of a styling chair. Came in about 3 days right before Christmas. Chair goes up &amp; down so if client is tall hold leverage down &amp; if short pump up. Far as putting together my husband stated \\&quot;it was a piece of cake 🍰\\&quot;. If i could give more stars I WOULD. Heavy chair looks like a $500 plus chair. Such a great chair. Will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> Great chair! A little hard to turn</li>
    <li> Husband:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to put together. Requires minimal tool usage, seeing as most things simply slide together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wife:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 5&#x27; 9&amp;#34; and the tallest setting still feels a tad bit short for some hair cuts. It&#x27;s not like I can tell a grown up to sit on a booster :). It pumps and deflates nicely. The swivel is smooth and nice. The chair and base are easily swept clean. I really enjoy it!</li>
    <li> Definitely a bang for its buck. Please remember that this is an inexpensive chair. It looks good, it works fine, its pretty easy to put together, its comfortable. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Me: &amp;#34;Hydraulics installed upside down with no grease/oil. Instead of pushing the lever with your foot, you have to pull it to pump/release it.&amp;#34;  Omwah.Inc: &amp;#34;The lever is installed wrong. You need to remove the lever and place it on the opposite side just like the instructions show. That should fix the issue.&amp;#34;  Me: &amp;#34;That fixed the pump/release issue, but NOT THE LACK OF HYDRAULIC FLUID. The chair still sticks, scrapes and scrubs when it goes up/down and turned. I have never had a chair this hard to maneuver before.&amp;#34;  Omwah.Inc: &amp;#34;If the pump is defective we can send you a new pump to replace that one. Would that work for you?&amp;#34;  Me: &amp;#34;Your product was advertised as NEW. I paid for a new chair, NOT a refurbished chair. When you offer to send me replacement parts for a brand new item, you are admitting you falsely advertised your product and are trying to coerce me to accept a refurbished product. You took your $109 chair with negative reviews because of the defect, relisted it at a higher price without the negative reviews, to continue to manipulate people into buying your defective product as new and refurbishing it at the consumers labor. Your company should have procedures in place to prevent this from happening. I paid for a new chair, not refurbished. I want my money back and a postage paid return shipping label to send the chair back to you.&amp;#34;  Omwah.Inc: &amp;#34;We sent you a brand new chair. From what it seems, the chair works fine and so does the pump. However, we are trying to keep you satisfied and hence we offered to ship you another part for the one you seem so unhappy with but you are still attempting to return. Since the chair is not defective and is a brand new chair, as our policy states, the buyer is responsible for return shipping therefore if you would like to ship the chair back to us, you would need to place it back in original shipping inside and out and send it back to us at 1110 West 17th St Vancouver WA 98660.There is also a 25% restocking fee that will be deducted from the final refund.&amp;#34;  Me: &amp;#34;The chair does not work fine. The chair IS defective. The chair still sticks, scrapes and scrubs when it goes up/down and is turned, even after the bar was installed on the other side. As I originally stated, my teenage children have difficulty getting it to perform these tasks. My 15 year daughter does piano tuning and repair is constantly helping her mentor move and lift pianos. It should not be easier to move a piano than it is to pump the chair up, make it go down or turn.  I told you from the very beginning that it acted like it did not have hydraulic fluid and the chair sticks, scrapes and scrubs when it goes up/down and is turned. The chair is defective. The chair does not perform like a brand new chair. The buyer should not be responsible for a restocking fee. The buyer should not be responsible for return shipping.&amp;#34;  Me: Still waiting for reply. Will probably have to file a claim with Amazon. Any way you look at it, stay away from this company. Stay away from this chair.  Omwah.Inc: After I submitted my review, this product stopped showing up in Amazon search results. When I went to it through the link in my order history it went right to it, but Omwah now has it listed as  &amp;#34;Currently unavailable. We don&#x27;t know when or if this item will be back in stock.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> It serves its purpose, although there were no instructions as to how to put everything together.  The back does not go back, so it can only be used in the sitting position.</li>
    <li> The instructions are not useful in anyway, but if you have a bit of practical knowledge on fixing things or assembly you will be fine.  If you don&#x27;t - I would strongly recommend to get someone to help you, because you could possibly rip the upholstery or strip a fitting and damage the chair.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE that this chair lowers enough so I can be above my clients head when doing lots of foils. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;5&amp;#34; tall. I used to have to ask them to slouch down in my chair to take the pressure off my shoulders.  I also LOVE the fact that the foot pedal doesn&#x27;t rack my clients in the ankles every time I turn the chair around for them to view their hair in a mirror  - it doesn&#x27;t do it ever, even with their feet tucked in on the footrest.&lt;br /&gt;The chair locks automatically so you have to tap the pedal to turn the chair, it took me a few times to do it without lowering the chair as well.  The shipping was right on schedule.</li>
    <li> it works good,was alittle hard to assemble but we finally got it put together. i like it but is hard to swivel on lowest level,just pump up once and swivels fine</li>
    <li> Awesome chair and quality</li>
    <li> It works. It turns around and pumps up and down. I have been in hair design for 35 years and have been used to quality equipment. You do get what you pay for with this salon chair. I wanted the least expensive chair I could find. I believe I found it. I will only be standing on my feet behind the chair for a few more years. That is why I did not want to pay 500.00 plus for a hydraulic chair. The foot rest is wimpy and very difficult to install so it looks straight, but it works. The hydraulic pump is just okay. The chair doesn&#x27;t seem to want to turn until you press your foot on the pump lever. I wasn&#x27;t used to this, so it will take some time. The most disappointing aspect are the cushions. They&#x27;re firm and assemble quite well but the stitching that creates the 6 square pattern is not lined up. This makes the chair look crooked, defective and cheap! At first glance, the chair in basic black isn&#x27;t bad looking in a utilitarian sort of way. I only hope the chair will last until I retire. I bought two and one is not better or worse than the other. Update 9/2/15 Unfortunately I waited past the return window otherwise I would be returning these chairs. I have been using these chairs for just over a month. First there is some rust just starting on the chrome of the foot-rest. Second, the ability to turn the chair while a client is seated, is becoming harder and harder. Thirdly, the foot pump is crap. It is positioned way to high. I thought I would adjust to it but that has not happened. I end up having to look under the chair to locate it and then lift my foot. If you pump it all the way it seems to cancel your effort and not go up. You must only halfway pump it. This is so unlike any other chair I&#x27;ve ever worked on. Fourthly, the vinyl used is to soft and rubbery. It easily scratches from buttons, zippers, etc. Lastly, with the stitching on the seat being askew, and the footrest almost impossible to keep straight, the chair just looks awful. I can not recommend this chair.I am now giving it 1 star (they won&#x27;t let me do 0) and will take the loss and find some new chairs.</li>
    <li> The chair does what it&#x27;s meant to do. No problem with the hydraulic pump, the upholstery or the swivel. However, the pin that&#x27;s supposed to secure the seat to the base simply cannot be placed into the place specified in the (short &amp; non-descriptive) instructions and the black, rubber bumper that goes around the bottom of the chair base broke almost immediately. This is not a fancy chair. If you&#x27;re looking for the most basic of basic salon chairs, this&#x27;ll do.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I wouldn&#x27;t consider this a barber chair, because there is no greatest and no recline for shaving.</li>
    <li> This chair works for a beginner.. But the hydraulic lift doesn&#x27;t go to high..</li>
    <li> The chair is great I would have given it 5 stars if I didn&#x27;t have such a hard time putting the arms on the chair, the screw holes are inside of the back seat which made it difficult to screw the bolts into because you can&#x27;t see inside and I tore the leather on the side of the seats trying to find the holes also the instruction Manuel isn&#x27;t very detailed at all I just kind of had to wing it also looked at a few YouTube videos, However once I got it put together it was awesome! I would buy this product again</li>
    <li> Did not come with any sort of detailed instructions on how to put it together.  Also the arm rests have to be screwed into where the zipper zips and this could potentially ruin the zipper very quickly.  Would not order this again .</li>
    <li> I love this chair it was easy to get it together although my hubby did that in less than 20 mins. I love it and will recommend it for anyone .</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough for this chair. Sturdy, comfortable, well made, perfect size, easy assembly. LOVE IT AND WILL DEFINITELY RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> Chair is missing pieces. Instructions are no help AT ALL! I have screws that are way to small so the pump is falling out smh the WORST product I have ever brought from Amazon</li>
    <li> This chair was easy to put together I use it on a daily basis all my clients say how comfortable it is compared to other salon chairs I would buy it again it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> I wanted to badly for this to work for us for my wife&#x27;s first salon... It&#x27;s such a very odd product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  No instructions, it comes with a solitary piece of paper that shows the components of the chair all assembled... Basically what you see above on the product page.  But I figured it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  The silver bolts holding everything together were put through slots they cut in the fabric and they are at very drastic angles not perpetual... But definitely not straight.  So it&#x27;s barelyyyyyy possible to assemble it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Once you get it all together bolt wise you presumably place the chair on top of the pneumatic pump and stand.  And here is really the deal breaker, everything is just so stiff and you feel like metal is grinding in metal when you pump.  And does it swivel? Maybe half the time and pretty stiffly.  The other half it will seemingly randomly get caught and no longer rotate... It&#x27;s a very frustrating unfortunate experience.</li>
    <li> This product is great for myself and clients. It was delivered quickly. No leaking oils (as some of the other reviews stated) although there is some stiffness when putting the chair up and down. Nice product for the price</li>
