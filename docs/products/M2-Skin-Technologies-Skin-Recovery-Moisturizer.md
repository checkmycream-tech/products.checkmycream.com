      <li>Great moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I heard about the products from a girlfriend who told me about them when I commented on how great her skin looked.  </li>
      <li>and i have been using it for some time with great results.</li>

      <li>This is my favorite moisturizer!</li>
      <li>I use this &amp; the skin refinisher and it works amazingly.  </li>
      <li>I do have to say that the shipment from Dermstore was very speedy and the service was excellent.</li>
      <li>So during the colder months, I suggest you find a good moisturizer you can put on top of it.</li>
      <li>I decided to give this a try after seeing it in an article listed as the top 10 acne products before going to a Dermatologist</li>
      <li>I love the way this product feels on my skin.</li>
      <li>and my skin has never been better.  </li>
      <li>I put some on at night and in the morning my skin looks way better.</li>
      <li>This is my third order and skin still looks and feels great!</li>
      <li>Best moisturizer I have ever bought in this price range, far superior to pricier products, it is light, fragance free and is quickly absorved into the skin.  </li>
      <li>This moisturizer keeps my face soft but also goes great with the skin refinish.</li>
      <li>This lotion works beautifully with the M2 20% serum to leave my skin feeling soft and smooth while continuing to deliver the malic and manelic acids to correct texture and pigment issues.</li>
      <li>an ideal moisturizer cause it may not be enough.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say it really did me any good.</li>
      <li>The formula is very light, non-greasy, and quickly absorbs into the skin.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product.</li>
      <li>My skin tone and color have become more consistent</li>
      <li>It is worth every penny!</li>
      <li>i live this product;it&#x27;s amazing</li>
      <li>Right now I am still searching for a heavier one but will definitely keep on buying this or the skin refinish which is also great.</li>
      <li>I use the M2 Refinish every other day and it&#x27;s a great product.  </li>
      <li>I also have hyperpigmentation from when I was pregnant</li>
      <li>The super oiliness of my skin has been reduced as well</li>
      <li>and I rarely get break outs anymore</li>
      <li>After about 6 months of regular use, I can honestly say that I can see myself using this line for the rest of my life.</li>
      <li>arrived quickly and exactly as described.</li>
      <li>But other than that I absolutely loved it.</li>
      <li>This lotion was great on my dry sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I have found that I do just as well with less costly moisturizers (CeraVe), but this was good when I used it.  </li>
      <li>I probably won&#x27;t buy this again (mainly price), but it&#x27;s NOT a bad product.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s consistent.</li>
      <li>I first discovered this through my dermatologist and have stuck to it since.</li>
      <li>I originally bought this in January and the container is no where near running out.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin look soft, have a healthy and natural glow</li>
      <li>But that isn&#x27;t a huge deal because you really only need to use this once a day</li>
      <li>thanks.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>I have very acne prone skin</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>It really moisturizes but is not greasy.</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Nothing&#x27;s ever really worked for me til I found M2.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery and product looked as advertised.</li>
      <li>am also enjoying their other products and recommend.</li>
      <li>Would recommend, it&#x27;s one of the less costly facial products and it actually is good.  </li>
      <li>You just press down on the top and the lotion comes out.</li>
      <li>I have hormonal acne and occasionally break out on my chin, but I am always looking for something to stop the breakouts even though my acne is mild.  </li>
      <li>Gentle moisturizing that leaves your skin with a natural looking glow.</li>
      <li>This lotion is great, I have very sensitive skin and finding a lotion that works is difficult.  </li>
      <li>I put the refinish cream on before sleep and first thing in the morning followed by the moisturizer 15 mins later and have seen signifigant improvement of my pore size and scars.</li>
      <li>WOW!</li>
      <li>The jar arrived with no box and no top and there was browned product covering the top of the jar.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a real bargain hunter and was very skeptical of the high price, but after wasting money on cheaper products that did not work, I&#x27;m happy to pay a little more for something that actually does what it advertises.</li>
      <li>I would rank this as one of the best moisturizing products that I have ever purchased.</li>
      <li>Used the entire bottle - as others had stated, had to break open the bottle to get more of the lotion out as packaging allows waste.</li>
      <li>within 1-2 weeks my skin finally started to calm down and within 3-4 weeks the cystic acne was completely gone.  </li>
      <li>I have had more deep cyst acne since I have started using both products, but that is happening less and less now.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to anyone with mild to moderate acne who has had no luck with salicylic acid on benzol peroxide in the past.</li>
      <li>Great consistency and smell  Keep it in the refrigerator, put it on cold!  </li>
      <li>The only downfall for me at all was that the product ran out really fast, and that could just be due tot</li>
      <li>This is a pretty heavy moisturizer, though, so I definitely would not recommend using this under makeup.</li>
      <li>and my skin is noticeably clear, with no new breakouts.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> M2 is a good product.  Got cheaper on Amazon which is good.  I have found that I do just as well with less costly moisturizers (CeraVe), but this was good when I used it.  Would recommend, it&#x27;s one of the less costly facial products and it actually is good.  I use the M2 Refinish every other day and it&#x27;s a great product.  I probably won&#x27;t buy this again (mainly price), but it&#x27;s NOT a bad product. Supposed to help with evening out skin tones and helping with breakouts.  It really moisturizes but is not greasy.</li>
    <li> arrived quickly and exactly as described. i live this product;it&#x27;s amazing and i have been using it for some time with great results. thanks.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer!  Great consistency and smell  Keep it in the refrigerator, put it on cold!  Feels awesome!!  I am acne prone and this doesn&#x27;t make me break out!</li>
    <li> I like the texture and the lightness.  I&#x27;m not sure about the squeeze down lid in the jar. I do like the product</li>
    <li> This lotion works beautifully with the M2 20% serum to leave my skin feeling soft and smooth while continuing to deliver the malic and manelic acids to correct texture and pigment issues. After about 6 months of regular use, I can honestly say that I can see myself using this line for the rest of my life. I&#x27;m a real bargain hunter and was very skeptical of the high price, but after wasting money on cheaper products that did not work, I&#x27;m happy to pay a little more for something that actually does what it advertises.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer has drastically improved my complexion. It has enough moisturizing properties not to create dryness but it does not clog pores, or feel heavy and with the Malic acid it reduces pore size and has made my skin so much clearer over the past month using it. I would recommend this product to anyone with mild to moderate acne who has had no luck with salicylic acid on benzol peroxide in the past.</li>
    <li> My Wife skin is dry and a lot of lotions make her break out. This works well and she doesn&#x27;t break out .</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say it really did me any good.</li>
    <li> I have struggled all my life with acne. I&#x27;ve tried everything from Proactive to Clearasil, soaps to wipes. Nothing ever worked. I decided to give this a try after seeing it in an article listed as the top 10 acne products before going to a Dermatologist and I have to say I am amazed at the results. Within the first couple of tries my blemishes that were swollen went down overnight. I have been using this, along with the 12% facial treatment for about two weeks and my skin is noticeably clear, with no new breakouts. I have quite a few acne scars, which are still there but not as red. It is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This lotion is great, I have very sensitive skin and finding a lotion that works is difficult.  From here on out this will be my lotion.  Please don&#x27;t change the ingredients, it&#x27;s perfect :)</li>
    <li> This is my favorite moisturizer! This is my third order and skin still looks and feels great! This is the moisturizer I&#x27;ve been looking for !</li>
    <li> This lotion was great on my dry sensitive skin. Very moisturizing. It paired well with the exfoliating cleaser and the M2 skin care skin refinish 20 percent. The only downfall for me at all was that the product ran out really fast, and that could just be due tot he fact that I use a ton of moisturizer on my skin because it is dry. But other than that I absolutely loved it. I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I use this moisturizer to help with my superdry winter skin, and some post-acne marks. This helps a LOT with both. I put some on at night and in the morning my skin looks way better. This is a pretty heavy moisturizer, though, so I definitely would not recommend using this under makeup. But that isn&#x27;t a huge deal because you really only need to use this once a day anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and to all the negative reviews on the packaging- I can&#x27;t imagine how this could be annoying at all. You just press down on the top and the lotion comes out. So don&#x27;t let that keep you from buying this!</li>
    <li> Not extremely pleased with this product. Read all the great reviews, did not notice a difference. Used the entire bottle - as others had stated, had to break open the bottle to get more of the lotion out as packaging allows waste. I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I started using this product 3 weeks ago in conjunction with the M2 skin recovery night serum.  I heard about the products from a girlfriend who told me about them when I commented on how great her skin looked.  She had been using M2 products for about 2 months.   Since I started using M2, my skin has begun to peel a bit which is what I was hoping for. But since it&#x27;s only been 3 weeks, it&#x27;s hard to say what the results will be.  I do have to say that the shipment from Dermstore was very speedy and the service was excellent.</li>
    <li> This recent order was not posted as satisfactory by me, it was returned.  The jar arrived with no box and no top and there was browned product covering the top of the jar.</li>
    <li> It counteracts the drying effect of the facial treatment&lt;br /&gt;Unique bottle&lt;br /&gt;Great products, I don&#x27;t use anything else on my face now but m2</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer. I was using it with the skin Refinish 20%.</li>
    <li> I have hormonal acne and occasionally break out on my chin, but I am always looking for something to stop the breakouts even though my acne is mild.  After many review on Sea Buckthorn oil, I decided to try it, well after about 1 month of using it, my chin broke out in terrible cystic acne which I never had before and it would not go away.  I purchased the M2 Skin Care HP Skin Refinish 20% along with M2 Skin Technologies Skin Recovery Moisturizer after reading great reviews on the products and within 1-2 weeks my skin finally started to calm down and within 3-4 weeks the cystic acne was completely gone.  I have been using this for about 3 months and I rarely get break outs anymore and when I do, they seem to go away faster.  I will never use Sea Buckthorn oil again, but will continue with M2 products.</li>
    <li> Nothing&#x27;s ever really worked for me til I found M2. I use this &amp; the skin refinisher and it works amazingly.  I almost never have a breakout, and I&#x27;ve struggled with breakouts and acne all my life.  I also have hyperpigmentation from when I was pregnant and it is clearing that up too.  Can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product.</li>
    <li> I would rank this as one of the best moisturizing products that I have ever purchased. The formula is very light, non-greasy, and quickly absorbs into the skin. I have very acne prone skin and I find that this product balances my skin after washing without causing breakouts. A little also goes a long way! I originally bought this in January and the container is no where near running out.</li>
    <li> WOW! Fast delivery and product looked as advertised. Thank you!</li>
    <li> At the end of the day my skin still feels great. Before using this cream by the afternoon my skin felt tight and dry and had to reapply. My skin tone and color have become more consistent also.&lt;br /&gt;I am also enjoying their other products and recommend.</li>
    <li> I use this with the M2 Skin Care HP Skin Refinish 20% 50 ml. and my acne has not come back. This moisturizer keeps my face soft but also goes great with the skin refinish.</li>
    <li> Purchase with the M2 Skin Care HP Skin Refinish 20% and use daily. I put the refinish cream on before sleep and first thing in the morning followed by the moisturizer 15 mins later and have seen signifigant improvement of my pore size and scars. I have had more deep cyst acne since I have started using both products, but that is happening less and less now. I have been using both products for 2 months now.</li>
    <li> I love the way this product feels on my skin. It makes my skin look soft, have a healthy and natural glow and it&#x27;s consistent. A little goes a long way so don&#x27;t over do it when using the product.</li>
    <li> This product helped my face a lot in keeping my blackheads, whiteheads, and pimples at bay. The super oiliness of my skin has been reduced as well and it helped regain the glow I used to have when I was younger. But during fall, especially winter, this may not be an ideal moisturizer cause it may not be enough.That&#x27;s the only reason why I took one star off. So during the colder months, I suggest you find a good moisturizer you can put on top of it. Right now I am still searching for a heavier one but will definitely keep on buying this or the skin refinish which is also great.</li>
    <li> I first discovered this through my dermatologist and have stuck to it since. Gentle moisturizing that leaves your skin with a natural looking glow. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer I have ever bought in this price range, far superior to pricier products, it is light, fragance free and is quickly absorved into the skin.  I use it every night before I go to bed and my skin has never been better.  I highly recommend it!</li>
