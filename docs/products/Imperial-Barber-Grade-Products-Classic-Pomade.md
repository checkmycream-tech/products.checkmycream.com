<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Hold is great, control is great, smell...ehh it&#x27;s oook. The good thing is that the smell isn&#x27;t that intense so you&#x27;ll be able to love with it</li>
    <li> This stuff is the bomb, I Love it!</li>
    <li> This product was ok. I liked the smell, but other than that it lacked in performance. It does not hold very well, so I don&#x27;t see why it would cost so much.</li>
    <li> Not a big fan. Coming from things like Suavecito, Layrite, Reuzel, Uppercut it just isnt up to par for me. I have afro type hair but im Caucasian. Most pomade i use straighten my hair right out and i get a perfect slick pack or pomp but this just didnt do the job for me. Loose hairs, curly beyond imaginale, no volume. I gave thise three stars for super fast shipping and because i know a lot about hair and pomade and i know this stuff could do wonders for people with straighter, finer hair. Just not for me.</li>
    <li> How are there reviews that this product holds?! It doesn&#x27;t. The label also says low shine, and that is not true either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m simply shocked by this disappointment and upset for shelling out over $20. After reading all these reviews, I thought I was sold because I love their matte paste so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: It weighs down blown dry hair, and is greasy. Stick with their matte paste - just use more of it, and a water-free hair spray. You&#x27;ll ne set.</li>
    <li> This is the worst Smelling pomade I have ever used.  Can&#x27;t even use it due to the smell...makes me nauseous.</li>
    <li> hold is very strong, but tends to clump. Also the scent isn&#x27;t amazing</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different water-based pomades (J.S. Sloane, Layrite, and Layrite Super Hold).  I would put this somewhere in the middle of Layrite and Layrite Super Hold in terms of hold -same as J.S Sloane.  I just do a simple pomp and it does the job.  My wife says it smells like a watermelon Jolly Rancher.  Overall I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Great price per oz. Works great. They were using this at my barber shop, so I picked some up on Amazon. Nice hold and I&#x27;ll be buying again, whenever this huge can runs dry.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little thick for working into my type of hair. Still a great product, I just prefer a more workable More giving brand.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product. The only thing that makes it a bit awful is the smell.</li>
    <li> Good Product. I am not a big fan of the smell. Makes my hair a little too shiny.</li>
    <li> Excellent pomade. The best pomade I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried a lot. From Suavacito to Uppercut Monster Hold. Imperial has the perfect blend. It doesn&#x27;t smell too strong, it holds tight, and most importantly the hold lasts all day. All the other products I have tried didn&#x27;t last or wouldn&#x27;t wash out (Uppercut Monster Hold). I have really thick long hair that I push back and this stuff keeps it in place with the volume I want. Give it a shot you won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion I think it smells like a really light melon/cucumber. Which I really dig and so does my lady :)</li>
    <li> Perfect consistency!!</li>
    <li> Good stuff. I do not like it as much as Imperial Matte Pomade. It holds better but seems to leave my hair a little stiffer. I would rate this 5 stars if I had not tried the Matte Pomade. Washes away easily in water.</li>
    <li> This stuff is magic. Yeah it&#x27;s around $20-25, but you&#x27;re getting 6 oz. of it. I paid $10 for a 1.9 oz. bottle of American Crew so that justifies this purchase for me. This took my ultra thick hair with 3 cowlicks and laid it down like it was nothing. It rained today and my hair didn&#x27;t budge. It has a slight hint of watermelon? It&#x27;s not too strong of a scent which is a good thing. Your hair will be stiff, but flexible. I don&#x27;t know how that makes sense, but that&#x27;s exactly what it feels like. It holds all day and all night until you wash it out in the shower which takes a total of 2 minutes. This is officially my go-to pomade.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff. The hair product I have been looking for my whole life.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t hold for the price.</li>
    <li> Great hold for combed back hair.</li>
    <li> After a few days and a few applications I think I can honestly review this. It&#x27;s not the worst, but certainly not the greatest, which has me questioning the validity of the rest of the reviews on here. I&#x27;ve been trying to find a replacement for American Crew High Hold Natural Shine forming cream [they don&#x27;t make anymore, only sell medium hold+shine cream now], but Imperial Classic Pomade is not it. I want something that holds but doesn&#x27;t leave the hair completely stiff. Yes this does exist, the Am. Crew. cream did that perfectly for my hair. This Imperial pom. holds about as well as other brands&#x27; medium strength. I won&#x27;t be buying this brand again &amp; just initiated the return on this one. I&#x27;m hoping I can find better. I&#x27;m open to suggestions on what to try next. The breakdown . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;+ scent is fine [if ya dig on smelling]&lt;br /&gt;+ doesn&#x27;t leave hair hard &amp; crunchy&lt;br /&gt;+ holds well for 2-3 hours before falling&lt;br /&gt;+ can &amp;#34;re-activate&amp;#34; with water i.e. re-use what&#x27;s currently in your hair [don&#x27;t all do this?]&lt;br /&gt;+ comparable to others in terms of price per ounce [~$10 per 3 ounces]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- scent doesn&#x27;t last . . .though fine by me, not into fragrance&lt;br /&gt;- hold doesn&#x27;t last . . .you&#x27;ll need to &amp;#34;re-activate&amp;#34; a couple times &amp; each time it is weaker/won&#x27;t last even an hour&lt;br /&gt;- have to use quite a bit to be moderately effective&lt;br /&gt;- packaging not as shown, it has black plastic lid not a grey metal one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum, VERY overrated. Returned!</li>
    <li> in my opinion Imperial classic and uppercut deluxe are best pomade in the market. Why because hold great (wavy hair), smell amazing and washout so easy also I always get compliments on my hair........how about that....BOOM</li>
    <li> Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great hold, great smell, will allow for a damp and dry look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, stiff hair. Keep sides very short, and medium-to-long length on top.</li>
    <li> Provides texture and hold; hair isn&#x27;t oily but form. Survived an hour under a motorcycle helmet.  nice masculine odor too.</li>
    <li> Best styling stuff ever</li>
    <li> I had been using American Crew Grooming cream, and Redkin pomade, but switched to Imperial on the recommendation of my barber, the performance was solid, but unlike any other Pomade&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used, it made my scalp itch, and often when I would open the jar there would be black splotches in the jar (looked like mildew to me).  I would remove a large amount of the pomade and the splotches would return the next day.  I discontinued use and moved on to Reuzel High shine with no ill effects.  I just simply can&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This pomade is EXCELLENT. Now, you are probably thinking, if I say it&#x27;s that good, why am I rating it 4 stars? Well, the pomade is heavy hold, but comes out with your sweat, and with the heat shining down. As an athlete and spending time outside this is a problem.</li>
    <li> Great product for thick coarse hair</li>
    <li> Great product. I have longer hair and it holds it perfectly without being crunchy.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> As they say, imperial has a superior holding strength and helps keep the classic look. Get it.</li>
    <li> Great pomade. Every time I find a pomade that I like, it gets discontinued. Hopefully this one stays on the market for a long time. Has great hold. Hair can be re-styled with a little water. Smells decent. Easy to wash off hands and out of hair. PERFECT!</li>
    <li> It smells great...nothing over powering and it&#x27;s not greasy....I&#x27;d say make sure what strength you get for what you want.I got the strongest and it&#x27;s not working the way I want and I believe on account that my hair is too long.over all I recommend it</li>
    <li> This is the best pomade, in my opinion. Holds all day, easy to washout, can wet it a little to reshape it and it STILL holds. Smells great. Hands down, won&#x27;t use another pomade.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. This product has the consistency of a mixture of gel and pomade. It smells really good, but when it comes to managing and shaping your hair... well its garbage. I have very manageable hair, not wavy not too thin not too thick, just right... This product made me feel like I put a &amp;#34;leave on&amp;#34; conditioner cream from my wife&#x27;s hair products cabinet.... Seriously try something different.</li>
    <li> Best pomade I&#x27;ve used so far. Holds my hair in place all day. No need to reapply at all throughout the day. Great hold!</li>
    <li> UPDATE 1 JUNE 2017:&lt;br /&gt;So I ran out of my regular got2bglued and used this because I had nothing left.  Not sure what changed between when I first tried it and now (see original review below) but this stuff has gotten much mo betta.  Wet hair first, apply a dollop (about the size of 3 pieces chewed gum) and I&#x27;ve got all day hold, including repeated putting on and taking off of cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW:  Not sure if I&#x27;m doing this wrong, but I&#x27;m not getting nearly the hold described here.  I used about 1.5 TBSP on damp hair (app. 3 inches long) to slick back and this stuff have me the ability to spike my hair, not slick it back.  I can honestly say it&#x27;s among the worst products I&#x27;ve tried yet. So far, bedhead got 2 be glued is the only product that works like everyone here said this works.  Problem is that turns my head into a freaking helmet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all that being said, the best darn smelling pomade I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I have very wavy thick hair, and I&#x27;ve tried tried many drug store products over the years to try and hold my hair relatively straight. Nothing worked very well. This pomade however does an amazing job at keeping the wave out of my hair. It&#x27;s the only product i&#x27;ll put in my hair from this point forward. Has a very light clean smell and it washes out easily. Well worth the price tag. I&#x27;ll definitively be ordering more when I run out.</li>
    <li> Great product...smells clean and when you sweat it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
    <li> The consistency is much thicker and stickier than a pomade</li>
    <li> First of all the smell is amazing. It is easy to work with. I recommend it for anyone trying to create any sort of style. It works on short hair as well as dry hair</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. My go to pomade right not. Plus what a deal, for the amount you get for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong. I&#x27;ve already told a few friends about it. I will definitely be reordering more when I run out.</li>
    <li> Just what I was always looking for.great product. I finally found the right pomade for me.I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought the wrong one this stuff is like glue</li>
    <li> Looks great in the hair and holds really well. Only con is my girlfriend says that it smells like glue and doesn&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> I have tried several of the top pomades (layrite, suavecito, Shiner Gold, American crew, Baxter, Axe and others) and this is the best product i have found so far. Pomades can either be way too hard like gels or have no hold at all. Imperial has a great hold but does not make your hair feel like a helmet, you can still run your fingers through it. Imperial also has low shine which makes for a more natural look. The smell very faint unlike other pomades, it smells a bit like watermelon when in the bottle but quickly goes away once you put it in your hair. It is very faint If your looking for a good pomade, definitely give this one a try.</li>
    <li> Love this Pomade, great hold! I am not a big fan of product in my hair but Imperial seems to be great for me. It washes off with water, it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy. I have ordered from them prior and will continue to do so. Love the product and its Made in the USA</li>
    <li> This stuff holds and smells great!</li>
    <li> This sufff work!! the only draw back in my opnion is the smell but i can live with that because it flat out work. Ive tried many other hair products now that i have a style that requires it and this is my favorite one.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff. Smells amazing too</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and it really keeps my hair held and place and gives it volume. There is a faint, neutral smell, but it doesn&#x27;t linger in your hair, even when you sweat. I&#x27;ve read of people complaining about the price compared to the 4oz brands, but keep in mind, this is 6oz</li>
    <li> Not as great for longer hair.</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend and this is the only thing that can take his curly mop into a profession slicked back do. Packaging was great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried both the Imperial fiber pomade and this one. I must say, I definitely prefer the classic. Has great hold, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and washes out easy. Will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different kinds of pomade &amp; this is the best one so far...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product &amp; excellent marketing.  I&#x27;m a fan of Imperial...</li>
    <li> Here goes,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the product is the best in the bunch as far as this category goes, comparable to layrite, but better. It&#x27;s more like a gel pomade, you know where it&#x27;s a pomade but dries like a gel. These shouldn&#x27;t be called a pomades because they&#x27;re not malleable after they dry. It&#x27;s better than layrite as far as product consistency and what it overall achieves, which is near perfection...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay with that being said this is a very good product. I love it actually except for two things which would give it the highest of rankings, the honorable 5. Now for me a drawback is the smell, like watermelon bubblicious, look I am 33 years old and don&#x27;t want to smell like a teen. If it only it smelled like coconut, sex wax. But they probably wanted to distinguish their smell from Dave&#x27;s pomade. I would prefer a masculine smell, but understand they have to market to woman as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another negative which is a serious legal lawsuit pending is that the website says their products are paraben free, but then you look at the products ingredients and it had methylparaben in it. .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a amazing pomade gel. Great product. It may be 20 dollars but at least It&#x27;s 6 oz instead of 3 so basically you&#x27;re getting 2 for 1 special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been wearing it for a couple days. Really liking the product.</li>
    <li> I am new to the whole world of pomade, have found this easy to work into my hair. I have thin blonde hair, this product works well without weighing it down. The smell is pleasant and it holds up all day.</li>
    <li> The best pomade I&#x27;ve ever used!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great hold, smells pleasant, and non-greasy.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t simply wash out of hair with rain, will dry back up to maintain hold. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Smelled fruity, not manly.  The hold was strong but not super strong.  It&#x27;s not for me.</li>
    <li> Smells good (subtle watermelon scent), holds very well but is very easy to work with after applying—it doesn&#x27;t immediately get sticky and unmanageable like a lot of other products.</li>
    <li> 5 stars, delivered on time, a little expensive but worth it, great product.  I would definitely recommend this to a friend!</li>
    <li> So far the best pomade I&#x27;ve used. Water soluble means easy to wash out. Decent hold less oily mess. Price is on the high side, but only need small amounts for styling compared to others.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have been using this now for about a year and I&#x27;m a huge fan.</li>
    <li> Great product, I&#x27;ve tried a ton of them, this is definitely my go to from now on!</li>
    <li> A phenomenal pomade and I have tried many. The extra price is worth it and since it is 6 oz will also last longer. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This product claim to be american strongest pomade and for me it not true, the hold is not really there and when there is wind, your hair won&#x27;t last, you would have apply much more to get a stronger hold especially on asian hair. I would put this product below uppercut and layrite, I don&#x27;t know why on other blog they would vote this among the best hold pomade. This product is overrated for me and I would go back to use layrite or uppercut</li>
    <li> Imperial Barber Products make quality hair supplies for men. The classic pomade is no exception. I have gotten over three months out of my first jar. I have curly hair and have found it very easy to apply, and had no problems washing it out.</li>
    <li> As much as this product is hyped, I just couldn&#x27;t see why. My hair is very thin, and I hate to use so much of the pomade which made it irritating for me to keep on going back to do that. It didn&#x27;t feel at all as if it was holding my hair in place, and I really had more expectations for it. Other people on here have said good things about it, but from what I&#x27;ve seen, it probably had the worst hold on my hair.</li>
    <li> Layrite is worlds better than this stuff</li>
    <li> All other reviews state the pros here.  This is, without dispute, the best pomade I&#x27;ve personally used.  I&#x27;d recommend this with complete confidence.</li>
    <li> Great product highly recommend it! I&#x27;ve been using it for two years now, finally found something that works with wearing a motorcycle helmet and still looks good after riding.</li>
    <li> This has been the best hair styling product I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It holds my thick hair all day. I do a classic side part and most other products will last half a day or barely make it through the day with my hair. Only a small amount is needed to hold the hair and this really depends on the water moisture of your hair. If you want a dryer look, simply add the pomade while your hair is dry and it will hold it well. I find that more pomade is needed when the hair is already dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I get a few stubborn strands throughout the day, I can simply apply some water to that area and the pomade will reactivate and hold it down again. It also does not look very greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very great product. I will purchase again once this batch is finished.</li>
    <li> There are people who live and breathe pomades and take pride in knowing a lot about them. That person is not me. However, I have been scouring the internet for recommendations on a pomade with low shine and a strong hold and was directed to this pomade by Imperial Barber and alternatively to Baxter of California Clay Pomade (which is a tiny fraction of the size and about the same price). I have fine hair and several mean cowlicks so I need something that is going to be strong without weighing my hair down. I generally keep my hair in a messy, spikey type of style so I don&#x27;t want something that keeps my head looking wet. I also have been known to break out on my forehead from other pomades so I&#x27;m always a bit hesitant trying new stuff. I&#x27;ve been using Got 2b Glued on a regular basis until this point but it lives up to it&#x27;s name and has the same effect as if you put white glue in your hair... and that&#x27;s great for keeping things in place but not so great for looking natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imperial Barber Classic Pomade is supposed to have a strong hold and comes in a very large 6 oz container. The packaging is very appealing and fits with the rest of my man grooming products. The scent is as others have described - like a watermellon jolly rancher - and I find it very appealing and light, not something people will likely notice. The pomade itself is colorless and has an odd texture. It is very much unlike any other pomade I&#x27;ve used in the past. At first I was a tad put off by the appearance and feel of it but in the end it is really irrelevant to its effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Classic Pomade works perfectly well once you figure out the right way to put it on. Your hair has to be just the right amount of wet/dry to get it to work right. I&#x27;m still figuring it out but when I do it right, I can generally get a good hold for the entire day. When I get it wrong, well, let&#x27;s just say that I basically have to start over. I disagree that this is a &amp;#34;strong hold&amp;#34; product. I think it fits more on the medium hold spectrum. The nice thing about this pomade is that, as a water-based product, you can restyle your hair throughout the day and still get hold as long as you don&#x27;t completely wash it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;d say it is a great pomade, especially considering it is a fraction of the cost of others. It&#x27;s an especially good choice for those who want a pomade with low-shine.I think it fits more on the medium hold spectrum.

    <li> This pomade/gel really holds your hair, but isn&#x27;t stiff.  Can be rewetted and restyled if your hair gets messed up.  A little goes a long way.  The price is a little higher than some other pomades or gels, but it&#x27;s a big jar and should last a long time.  I suppose there&#x27;s a reason this stuff has been around forever--it works.</li>
    <li> I have purchased many different hair products and I have to say that this is probably one of the strongest.  Please be aware though that this does have a lot of shine when adding it to your hair! Overall, this is a great &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; pomade but is still on the expensive side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing I like about this pomade is how easily you can wash it out.  There were some other brands that were very difficult to rinse off and I hated that.</li>
    <li> One if the best pomades I have used.</li>
    <li> I have fair skin and dark blond hair, almost brown and I typically go for the clean cut classic look (like that hard drinking guy that works in advertising). This pomade holds well and has a decent amount of shine. The smell is surprisingly a candy/sweet sort of smell. The pomade however is really sticky and pulls on my hair kind of hard when I throw it in. I have tried applying it lightly however it still pulls a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was trying this as an alternative to the American Crew pomade found in most stores.The typical Crew brand comparatively has a lighter, creamier texture ─ and for my hair type a little bit more of a shine. The Crew applies easier and more evenly however this Imperial stuff has a little bit of a stronger hold. At the end of the day, Crew will stay shiny however this product can make my hair feel a bit dry (I admit that this is most likely with regards to my hair type). All in all it is a decent product and I am certainly willing to try some of the other stuff Imperial has to offer.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. It held my wavy hair straight back. Not too shiny. Smells nice. Prime product arrived on time and packaged well.</li>
    <li> I read a couple reviews saying this was good for fine hair, but it doesn&#x27;t hold my fine hair as strongly as I expected, or as strongly as a product like Layrite does. Although, the imperial does not make my hair hard which is great. It&#x27;s hold kinda melts in and remains soft and pliable. Also, guess I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the reviews, but the picture can doesn&#x27;t mention anything about low shine, the real can you get delivered does. It&#x27;s a matte product. Still happy, I have 6oz to experiment with until I get it right.</li>
    <li> Love this product wish it came in a larger size. Works great!!</li>
    <li> I really like that it&#x27;s a matte finish and the hold is wonderful for a while. For some reason as the night progresses my hair will usually start dying from its slicked back position and going different directions. I have tried re-wetting it to restyle, but it doesnt seem to get any of its strength back. If it somehow maintained its strong hold yet non-flaky spikey feeling, i&#x27;d give this a 6 out of 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Great product for a decent price.  A little on the drier side so my hair needs to be damp when used .</li>
    <li> Suuuper fast shipping. And I thought the prod was crap at first but it was me who needed practice. I&#x27;ll nEver go back to gel</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the 50&#x27;s style cut for a couple years now and have tried all kinds of products as my girlfriend is a stylist. So from the top salon stuff to the cheaper ones. This is definitely my favorite along with the bumble and bumble wax. I like to support the LA based company and this is all American made too.</li>
    <li> Great hold (not too stiff) &amp; nice shine.&lt;br /&gt;Has a pleasant scent...(watermelon i believe)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of both worlds.( in the sense its WB...and can wash out easily. or you can &#x27;reactivate it&amp;#34; by wetting your brush/comb and fixing your hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price for 6 oz</li>
    <li> I am rather picky with what I put in my hair. The smell, hold, feel, and look of a hair product are things I take into consideration. I have tried Rock On Matte Clay Pomade and their Classic pomade as well as Publix brand finishing wax. These products described were decent quality and on the cheaper side compared to Crew and other big named brands but they do not compare to Imperial Barber Products Classic Pomade. I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better deal on  such a great product. With this product I know my hair looks good because the shine is just right and it holds all day even when I&#x27;ve broken a light sweat. It takes very little to get the job done and so I know I will have it for a good amount of time. Additionally this product smells better than any other pomade or wax I&#x27;ve used or tested and after being washed out I found my hair was softer than normal. This is a great product at a great price considering per ounce it is cheaper than most pomades I have come across.</li>
    <li> To high of a price for everyday use,but over all good product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Of the hair products that I&#x27;ve used, this is my favorite. The hold is very strong, it spreads easily and evenly throughout my hair, and the finish is a perfect matte texture that&#x27;s not too shiny or too dull. I have rather thick hair, and I had previously used Baxter of California&#x27;s Clay Pomade. The Clay Pomade, which does provide great hold, didn&#x27;t spread as easily through my hair. Plus, the Imperial Classic came in a 6oz jar for practically the same price. This is a value that can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> strong hard, smells good.</li>
    <li> The best pomade EVER! easy to wash off since water based. I was introduced to this from my barber since he carrys the whole line of imperial barber products at his shop. This specific pomade is great as it has a very strong hold but with a little water and a good comb you can always fix if needed but more than likely not. I went to sleep with it on and the next day it still held on strong. Smells great as well (watermelon scent). Kinda pricy but worth it IMO. I&#x27;ve used layrite and its decent as well but not as strong as this stuff good if your on a budget and need a backup if your out of this stuff. Low shine but if you want that sheen just use hairspray to finish off.</li>
    <li> Best pomade! Very strong hold and smell very good</li>
    <li> so far this is my favorite pomade. awesome hold, shine and smell. I love this stuff</li>
    <li> 1st time using it. Good product. Decent hold. Smells good. Would buy again</li>
    <li> I purchased based on all the great reviews but didn&#x27;t have the same experience. My hair is probably a bit tougher than most as its super straight and wants to just stick up everywhere with the exception of a few special spots that like to form some random waves aka cow lick.  I was hoping to use this as a sole hair product but it didn&#x27;t have enough hold power.  I had to use with either a hairspray or a very strong gel to get the hold I needed.  I will stick with the yellow bottle of moco de gorilla that cost $3 and lasts months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an undercut pomp style&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like:&lt;br /&gt;  light smell&lt;br /&gt;  washes out easy&lt;br /&gt;  non greasy&lt;br /&gt;  not too shiny&lt;br /&gt;  easy to style with&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didnt like:&lt;br /&gt;  price&lt;br /&gt;  hold performance&lt;br /&gt;  hair left feeling a bit dryer than normal</li>
    <li> Superb!  Not oilly and  nice fragrance of melon. WANT BUY AGAIN</li>
    <li> Great product. Use it daily now.</li>
    <li> Best men&#x27;s hairstyling product out there.  Holds reasonably well, smells great, but best of all it rinses out so easily.  I&#x27;m used to waxes that will not come out without 3 or 4 washes.  This rinses clean with just water.</li>
    <li> Best Pomade hands down</li>
    <li> Very good pomade. Holds well, washes out easy and has no scent.</li>
    <li> Short and sweet:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Smells amazing; like candy&lt;br /&gt;Nice container&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;No hold at all&lt;br /&gt;Too expensive for the bad quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sticking with Layrite Super Hold</li>
    <li> Tried all the other competitors (petrol based and water soluble) and this is by far the best.  Smell might not be as nice as coconut, but it&#x27;s not bad.  Really easy to apply and work through, and doesn&#x27;t get as crunchy.  The best overall blend.  A nickel size dab will do ya.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I seldom write reviews, but I love this product. I&#x27;ve been using cream-based products for my combed-down look, as water-based products I&#x27;ve found in stores have not been able to hold down my thick hair. The problem is these cream-based products are very greasy and cause bad breakouts on my face. Since using the Imperial classic pomade my acne has diminished, and my hair feels better after a wash- no residue left behind. It also holds extremely well, even after a rainy and windy day my hair looks 98% the same in the afternoon as when I did it in the morning. It has a very light, inoffensive scent- similar to fresh laundry, that you only smell when you open the jar, not so much when its in your hair. All in all, this is the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. I have thick wavy latin hair that never wants to cooperate. I originally greased up with Murray&#x27;s Superior but that stuff murders my pillowcases. Making the transition to a water-soluble product with Imperial has been pretty seamless. I like to towel-dry my hair and then get a nice wad of this in. Combing is effortless and my hair almost pomps up on its own. Other similar products tend to leave a matte finish but this stuff seems to retain most of its sheen. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a day and love it so far. Some things worth noting:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. By firm hold, they mean gel-like hold. Your hair isn&#x27;t going anywhere with this stuff in. Coming from medium hold pomade to this stuff was quite a change. Don&#x27;t expect to need a comb or brush all day because they won&#x27;t go through your hair once it&#x27;s dried. BELIEVE ME.&lt;br /&gt;2. It foams like soap when it comes in contact with water. Not sure why, but doesn&#x27;t affect application at all.&lt;br /&gt;3. I would suggest using with damp hair because it&#x27;s so thick. I can&#x27;t imagine applying this to dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;4. Nice, fruity smell. Not perfume level, just enough to not have a chemical smell. Smell went away when it dried.&lt;br /&gt;5. It doesn&#x27;t need too much water to revitalize. Wet your hands and slick back. Works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real complaint about the product is that the hold is so strong. I actually like using a military brush throughout the day to smooth my hair out, but this stuff is so hard when dry that I can&#x27;t use a comb or brush. Some would say that&#x27;s a plus, not me. Excellent product for the price though.</li>
    <li> Really like this hair product, I use it for a comb-over. Has a nice strong hold, but also doesn&#x27;t get stiff like gel and other products do. Spreads easily and disperses evenly throughout hair. Nice subtle scent and a good value for a 6oz premium pomade.</li>
    <li> I have purchase 6 other pomades but this is the best one so far. Has a strong hold for long hair. The smell ant the best but has a strong hold</li>
    <li> My wavy hair appreciates your superior product. It makes it straight and not curl. The hold is awesome. Word to the wise, apply to wet damp hair unless your reanacting the scene on Something About Marry.</li>
    <li> Holds real well and not much shine, which I like. A little pricey, but since it comes in 6 oz should last longer. Would purchase again</li>
    <li> Imperial is the gold standard in pomade</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used just about every other kind of pomade out there, and this is great.  It&#x27;s got an extremely firm hold which you may or may not like—but it looks natural and feels great.</li>
    <li> This is a long overdue review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t work for my husband&#x27;s stubborn hair.&lt;br /&gt;I had such high hopes and it was so expensive.&lt;br /&gt;The lid also started to rust a month after we got it. Cheap stainless steel? Not what I expect of something made in the US.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing else has rusted in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars is because it works well on my fringe when I want it swept aside.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair so any normal product should work. But I like how natural it makes it look and the smell of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not buying anymore once we run out.</li>
    <li> Imperial put out a great product here!</li>
    <li> Very thick - a little goes a long way, but it works well on my short hair.</li>
    <li> The best Pomade out their!</li>
    <li> Good product.  Strong hold</li>
    <li> I had been using the pomade by AXE, and this is less expensive per ounce and way better.  Strong hold, keeps hair looking very clean and classy.</li>
    <li> Not as strong hold as other&#x27;s, it&#x27;s does Ok for my hard style hair since it&#x27;s curly. Just because of that if not it works well.</li>
    <li> favorite pomade. high quality and perfect hold for thick hair. love this product</li>
    <li> Iv&#x27;e been on the market for some time now in search of the perfect pomade. I found this and instantly fell in love. Great hold, lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I do a pomp and also a slick back. Works great for both.&lt;br /&gt;*Washes out with ease.&lt;br /&gt;*The smell is slightly fruity and not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I recommend this product to anyone looking for a great modern pomade.</li>
    <li> Great, but not as good as Layrite.</li>
    <li> I actually dont think its good for my hair personally, I have really thick and wavy hair &#x3D;/ but I do really enjoy the fiber/pomade one sigh I wish I actually got that one instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: water based, use water to smoothe it up again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons: hard to spread on thick hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so it depends on you my experience is better with fiber/pomade imperial</li>
    <li> Nice watermelon scent. Holds very well.</li>
    <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a decent value for what you get but I just thought it would have more of an American Crew feel to it after applying.  I&#x27;ve found that it gets a little &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; almost like a hairspray finish, when it dries.  Like I said, not bad, but was expecting a bit more after reading the online reviews and seeing it ranked as one of the top pomades in some online articles.  I will likely return to American Crew when this jar runs out</li>
    <li> I started using pomades with a new haircut a couple years ago, and I started with the cheapest stuff I could get at Walmart--Axe brand. I&#x27;m not proud of that decision, but I don&#x27;t deny it. More recently I discovered that Old Spice makes a pomade, and I started using it. There were pros and cons to both, but neither holds a candle to this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Axe was nice because it was thoroughly water-based and could easily be &amp;#34;revived&amp;#34; in the bathroom with a dab of water on the go, but it rarely held through the day without having to be revived. The biggest concern I had with Axe, other than perpetuating a brand whose advertisements morally offend me, is that the clearish blue pomade appeared to have flecks of glitter in it. Now I never saw glitter in my hair using it, but it they were definitely in the container, and that&#x27;s a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old Spice is a very different sort of product. It is white and has a better hold, but it can&#x27;t be revived. It will also leave white streaks if your not careful to work it in well, and worse than that, I always have to shampoo my hair twice (no matter how much shampoo I use) to get it all out in the shower. I appreciate the Old Spice brand, and I like it better than Axe, but I remained unsatisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Imperial Barber Products Classic Pomade. It is clear and surprisingly thick. The jar says it can be applied to dry hair, but that seems like it would be a rather unpleasant experience. I use this right after I get out of the shower, with my hair still pretty damp, and it goes on like a charm. You only need a small amount, and I think that will end up saving me money over the long run against the cheap pomades that require more product for the same hold (including the aforementioned Axe and Old Spice). This stuff has a strong hold that lasts all day and takes a lot of punishment. And even if you do find your hair loosing the sharp look at 3:00pm, dabbing it with just a little water and reshaping it is simple and works like a charm. This stuff revives very well, and it is also water-based and really easy to wash out. No more double shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as an added bonus, it&#x27;s cool, and retro, and made in the USA. We have a winner.and works like a charm.

    <li> Highly recommend this pomade. It&#x27;s water based so you don&#x27;t have to worry about having to pull your hair off to wash it out. Also, has a shinny look even after it dries.</li>
    <li> This pomade reminded me more of a gel type hold on my hair, pleasant light melon smell with a clear waxy consistency. While it did hold my hair fairly well I was disappointed seeing this contains Propylene Glycol, Methylparaben, and Propylparaben among other chemicals, personally I would not purchase this brand again as it was middle of the road for me, better options are available.</li>
    <li> I have tried just about every product for my sons hair he has a few cowlicks and this stuff is the best! big jar and you only need to use a little.</li>
    <li> Great product. Has a bit thicker consistency than Layrite. Good smell and you get 6oz. where other pomades usually only give you 4. It is a bit oily when you first apply. I would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Smells good like melon. Doesn&#x27;t hold too strongly.</li>
    <li> Best pomade out there !</li>
    <li> From my use so far, not nearly as strong of a hold as advertised. I have pretty fine hair and it falls loose pretty easily. It also makes my hair look greasy. I may go back to Uppercut Deluxe Pomade. I will keep using and possibly update my review.</li>
    <li> This pomade works well.</li>
    <li> Smells great, holds alright, just not meant for super stubborn curly hair on a windy day, washes out with no problem.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I have very curly hair (And I am Black) but this product keeps my hair tight. I have been using the product for a while and I would recommend it to anyone. My only wish is to have a bigger size at the same price. HINT!!!</li>
    <li> I like it better than Lay rite</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used. I have thick curly hair and this imperial gets it pin straight.</li>
    <li> If you know what sweaty, dust laden hair feels like, and you don&#x27;t mind that, then this product is for you. It does hold though. For the price there are many superior products out there.</li>
    <li> The only pomade out there as far as I&#x27;m concerned. Amazing hold. Goes a lot further than American Crew or any other water based pomade.</li>
    <li> Classified as Pomade but it hardens like gel after use. You can reactivate it with water but it loses its hold.  Neutral smell, good hold.</li>
    <li> It is a good and nice product!!</li>
    <li> Light application doesn&#x27;t hold very well. Heavy application and it feels sticky. The work as well as some of the other products I&#x27;ve used</li>
    <li> I love this product. I wish someone sold it locally. And in a larger size container</li>
    <li> A good product. But leaves my hair kind of dry</li>
    <li> First I would like to say that the quality of this product is amazing, I take pride in my hair so I want to treat it well.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried different hair products such as AXE, MOCO de GORILLA, BED HEAD, CREW, 3 FLOWERS, &amp; TEA TREE...and by far this is the best I have used.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply and rinse from hands, and when you shower it comes out really easy.&lt;br /&gt;The light hint of watermelon is a great feature as well....highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a ton of other hair products finding something that will hold longer &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; hair without drying into some crackly mess. This stuff is doing good so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell: interesting smell, nothing offensive, but could certainly have a bit more manly musk to it or something&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hold: The stuff works. Period. Holds everything in place, you can apply at different levels of dryness for different holds, very flexible and working well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The application: this is where it&#x27;s weird, when it starts out from the container, it&#x27;s like a super think gel. Apply to dryer hair and it&#x27;ll have a really strong hold and is harder to apply. Apply to too wet of hair and it starts breaking down and turns almost into what looks like shampoo in you hair (don&#x27;t worry it&#x27;ll dry fine!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Find the perfect balance and play with different levels of hold and dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product, hope they come out with some variants!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, tight hold, low shine.  Give you the hold you need without making your hair look greasy, will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This product performs perfectly for me. Just a little dab is plenty. It washes out very easily. I will purchase again. Also, after having it in my hair all day, I tried rubbing a little water through my hair, and re-combed it. It came out great with holding ability intact.</li>
    <li> This is the best pomade I have used thus far. The fragrance is very light and it spreads easily on hair. It holds all day. I don&#x27;t have to do touch-ups throughout the day because this pomade hold well. It is easy to wash off and wont leave oily residue on clothes.</li>
    <li> Great product. Starts off gummy, works into a smooth consistency. Smells a little sweet but no qualms on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Medium hold on hair and a medium shine as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Pretty good pomade.  A little greasier looking than I had hoped but it worked well.</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely the best pomade out there. I have quite a thick mane of straight hair, and this tames it like none other. Sure, this is a bit pricey, but I was paying $16 for 3 oz. of American Crew Fiber, and this knocks that out of the park. I have been using this for about four months now, and the can is not quite half-empty. I usually apply this with damp to dry hair and get great results. It doesn&#x27;t take away volume, which is an issue with straight-haired guys, and it restyles quickly with a little water and a comb. The watermelon scent, while not the manliest, isn&#x27;t overpowering and just makes your hair smell fresh. It&#x27;s also easy to apply a small amount right before a date to reinforce the hold for the rest of the night. This stuff hold really well, too. I usually only use it to get a nice, sharp part and to hold the front in place. For the rest of the hair, I just use a general push through with my fingers. Imperial doesn&#x27;t gunk up the combs I use like the old American Crew, either. It is very easily washed out and cleaned up due to it&#x27;s water-based chemistry. For the price, this stuff is a great buy. Made in L.A., holds tighter than hell, smells good, washes out easily, easy clean-up from hands--you just can&#x27;t beat this stuff.</li>
    <li> Very pleasant and neutral scent that dissipates. Good hold and shine. Perfect for that dapper slick look.</li>
    <li> Great hold and styling gel.  Sold at my barber shop for much more than here.</li>
    <li> doesnt flake! ill be re buying</li>
    <li> Best hair product I have ever used. Good hold and easy to rinse.</li>
    <li> One of the better pomades I&#x27;ve tried my hair is pretty thick this stuff holds nicely. Washes out easily being water based and reactivates with a little water as well. Use sparingly a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> I was pretty excited about this product but was not at all what I expected or like other pomade I am used to. the hold is very firm and dry. My hair flakes easily using Imperial and does not re-activate with water as advertised.</li>
    <li> low shine and lasting all day long，also smells lovely.</li>
    <li> wash abillity good and hair is shine</li>
    <li> This is my new go to pomade.  I previously used the fiber pomade made by Imperial but this has more of a hold with less shine.  You can re-style on the go when needed.  It smells like bubble yum watermelon.  Washes out very easily with water.</li>
    <li> I have been ordering this product for about 3 months now and I highly reccomend it. It last throughout the whole day and it smells good. Smells like kiwi but not to frooty were its overwelming. My only concern is that instead of having a silver top my most recent pomade that i ordered has a black one. I was kind of skeptical because it looked fake but the results are the same. Overall i will continue buying this pomade</li>
    <li> the hold is great and lasts all day long, and smells like a grape blow-pop</li>
    <li> Really nice stuff. It smells of pear, honeydew. This is the elusive smell no one can seem to describe.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite pomade that I have used so far. Suavecito stuff is fine, and certainly cheaper, but Imperial has excellent hold, doesn&#x27;t flake and smells pleasingly reminiscent of watermelon bubblegum.</li>
    <li> Wow, this product is great. Nice shine but not heavy! Would definitely buy again.  All of the other pomades clumped my hair together, this didn&#x27;t. Plus love the smell.</li>
    <li> This is honestly a great product.</li>
    <li> First off, I hate having gel and hairspray or any type of products in my hair so this was a trial run for a product I&#x27;ve never used before.&lt;br /&gt; Went out and got a good up to date haircut and the barber styled my hair with this product. He told me I might get lucky looking so good. I laughed all the way home until I GOT LUCKY. Lol&lt;br /&gt;I had very low expectations but was surprised. Product goes on easy. Holds hair very good and doesn&#x27;t make it feel like a glue helmet. Smell is very faint and pleasing. Its not heavy or greasy feeling. Combing my hair trying to get that same barbershop look and I feel it grabbing. Wet my comb and keep combing until I get it right then out the door. I did something I have never in my life been able to do. I went the whole day with a product in my hair without going nuts. I am impressed with every aspect of this stuff. I picked imperial because of its reviews and I think I hit gold.</li>
    <li> This stuff holds very well and seems to be very natural. It&#x27;s also got a great scent. This was recommended to me by a great barber shop in portland. It holds strong all day on all types of hair.</li>
    <li> If you have wavy or curly hair that you are trying to control this isn&#x27;t the pomade for you.  While it does provide some hold and volume it isn&#x27;t strong enough to withstand mildy wavy hair without using an excessive amount.  I still swear by Lay Rite Super Hold.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had the product too long but I already love it! I have really thick curly hair and this pomade honestly lets me style my hair exactly how I want and pretty easily also! It&#x27;s pretty thick so when styling it causes a little pulling but nothing to bad. It&#x27;s also really nice that it washes out same day. No hassle like the oil based product.. Rinsing, care, etc. I&#x27;ll definitely buy this product again</li>
    <li> it has great hold and shine. Smells fantastic! lasts all day</li>
    <li> I heard this particular pomade smelled like watermelon and the rumors were indeed true. Has great hold and surprisingly a decent shine considering the product says low shine. Lasts for hours and if my hair started looking a little off, using a little bit of water fixed it right away.</li>
    <li> Strong hold, stronger than American Crew Fiber. Smells tropical.</li>
    <li> A little pricey but an excellent product</li>
    <li> I wish this product would of lived up to the hype and the 5 star review reputation but I was sadly disappointed. Do not get me wrong this is an awesome product but does not live up to the high hold. It does have a nice smell to it but the hold is not solid. I put this under Uppercut Deluxe and recommend it over Imperial. Sorry</li>
    <li> I have slightly curly hair. Holds great. Lasts all day and washes out easily. Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I came across this pomade after doing numerous comparisons with other brands and reviews. I personally have naturally fine hair, so it was  challenge to find a pomade that did not weigh my hair down and separated the strains enough to give a &amp;#34;fuller&amp;#34; look. As I have a pixie style haircut, it does not take much of the pomade to style my hair (about dime-sized). Even though I can&#x27;t carry it with me to the airport for short trips, I can still put some into a contact lens case and it&#x27;ll last me for more than a week and fit in the quart-sized bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest putting this in hair that is already dry. It also works on damp hair and if you blow-dry it will add some volume. As this is water-based, it reactivates when you have damp hands and need to re-style after a windy walk. I&#x27;d highly recommend this product. It has a watermelon smell that&#x27;s not too fruity, so great for both guys and gals.</li>
    <li> I use to use the cheap pomade stuff that would cost $3, my wife ordered this for me and I was actually uupset she spent $22 on it but I&#x27;ve very glad she did. Its lasted a very long time and works and smells amazing!</li>
