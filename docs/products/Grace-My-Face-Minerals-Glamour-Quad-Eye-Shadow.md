      <li>This is an instance where you hope for a good product from the description and reviews ... and what you receive is SO MUCH MORE!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love these colors!</li>
      <li>These colors are amazing.  </li>
      <li>Love, love them!</li>
      <li>I love the colors and love this product-will reorder!</li>
      <li>pretty and great quality</li>
      <li>and im sooo pleased ..</li>
      <li>Love the colors in this array of mineral shadow.</li>
      <li>Love the color combination...</li>
      <li>They looked sparkly but they have more of a matte finish.</li>
      <li>the more I practice.</li>
      <li>You only have to use the smallest amount for fabulous, flawless color.</li>
      <li>They are easy to use and it makes your eyes stand out.</li>
      <li>Super, colors pop and stay on all day :)</li>
      <li>All in all, I am one very satisfied customer and highly recommend this for anyone who has a sensitivity to eyeshadows.</li>
      <li>Would look great on someone much younger!</li>
      <li>Everything was exact and love the product</li>
      <li>so they won&#x27;t get used up quickly.</li>
      <li>Colors are very pretty.</li>
      <li>You must have good brushes to apply it, and one little trick I use to keep the powder from falling on to my cheeks is to lightly spray my brushes with water before applying.</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic product, and I am definitely ordering more colors.</li>
      <li>The only thing is that I wish the colors were darker, other that the product is great!</li>
      <li>They are highly pigmentation, goes on smoothly.  </li>
      <li>They go great w/ a soft pink blush as well as a plum blush.</li>
      <li>These were presented in a small bag and the colors were very nice.</li>
      <li>The makeup does not wear well and wears off very fast.</li>
      <li>/&gt;this is the first time im using this product</li>
      <li>They go on so smooth, not too light &amp; not to heavy.</li>
      <li>It gets the purple look I need and the colors are just as pictured, which is unusual for ordering makeup online I&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>It arrives in a cute drawstring bag you can use again for other things.</li>
      <li>Love the darker of the purples and they show really well on my dark skin.</li>
      <li>The quality is high so these stay on all day.</li>
      <li>Seriously, I cannot think of another eye shadow that I&#x27;ve tried that blends as nicely as these do.</li>
      <li>I am an african american female and I love the pigmentationon my skin tone.</li>
      <li>For the first time in years, I can finally wear purple/plum eyeshadows with no irritation, redness, itching, or weeping of my eyes.</li>
      <li>Would have preferred matt for my mature eyes.</li>
      <li>Items are very small not much material for the price, three colors in larger quantities would be more appreciated.</li>
      <li>Since this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used loose powder, I feel pretty certain that I will be less messy with it</li>

    <li> pretty and great quality</li>
    <li> Containers are small, but i guess i really didn&#x27;t read how big they were $3-4 per jar ain&#x27;t bad.  I&#x27;ve got plenty of other eyeshadows to use so they won&#x27;t get used up quickly.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors but didn&#x27;t realize they were shimmery. Would have preferred matt for my mature eyes. Would look great on someone much younger!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and came in neat bag wrapped up! Cute for gifting!!</li>
    <li> These were presented in a small bag and the colors were very nice.</li>
    <li> For the first time in years, I can finally wear purple/plum eyeshadows with no irritation, redness, itching, or weeping of my eyes. This is a fantastic product, and I am definitely ordering more colors. It stays on all day long! The only slight downside I&#x27;ve found is that it is messy. You must have good brushes to apply it, and one little trick I use to keep the powder from falling on to my cheeks is to lightly spray my brushes with water before applying. This makes the shadow stick plus has the added effect of making the color a little bolder too. Since this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used loose powder, I feel pretty certain that I will be less messy with it the more I practice. All in all, I am one very satisfied customer and highly recommend this for anyone who has a sensitivity to eyeshadows. You won&#x27;t have it with this brand!</li>
    <li> These items are not as good as they say. The makeup does not wear well and wears off very fast. I would not order again. Product seems to be of inferior quality. NOT Bare Minerials quality. Very unhappy with purchase.</li>
    <li> The only thing is that I wish the colors were darker, other that the product is great!</li>
    <li> Super, colors pop and stay on all day :)</li>
    <li> Great colors and you can use them anytime!  They are easy to use and it makes your eyes stand out.</li>
    <li> I love the colors and love this product-will reorder!</li>
    <li> The colors are just amazing &amp;lt;3 staying power is great as well.&lt;br /&gt;this is the first time im using this product and im sooo pleased ..&lt;br /&gt;Item was neatly and properly packed&lt;br /&gt;would recommend</li>
    <li> Re-application needed throughout the day as shadow does not wear well. Fine if you  just want a very subtle look. I expected the containers to be a bit larger.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these colors! They go on so smooth, not too light &amp; not to heavy. The 4 different colors can be matched so up differently to give you a couple of different looks. They go great w/ a soft pink blush as well as a plum blush. Love, love them!</li>
    <li> Package was leaking product</li>
    <li> These colors are beauuuutiful! I used to use an eyeshadow primer to make my shadows last. It&#x27;s not necessary with these. I&#x27;ve never heard of Grace My Face products...I look forward to purchasing the mineral powder concealer. The other leading mineral powder concealer makes my face itch to no end.</li>
    <li> These colors are awesome but I think the lighting in the picture is misleading. They looked sparkly but they have more of a matte finish. There is a slight sparkle but not what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Great product and came in a timely manner!!</li>
    <li> Use a primer before using these. They are highly pigmentation, goes on smoothly.  Colors are very pretty.</li>
    <li> Items are very small not much material for the price, three colors in larger quantities would be more appreciated.</li>
    <li> Love the darker of the purples and they show really well on my dark skin. I am an african american female and I love the pigmentationon my skin tone. Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Love the color combination...nice compliments!</li>
    <li> Love the colors in this array of mineral shadow. It gets the purple look I need and the colors are just as pictured, which is unusual for ordering makeup online I&#x27;ve found. It arrives in a cute drawstring bag you can use again for other things. I used it to send out jewelry for my business, that&#x27;s how nice they look! It also arrived before the projected date. The quality is high so these stay on all day. They are hard to apply since they come in pots rather than boxes but I will get used to it.</li>
    <li> These colors are amazing.  The quality is excellent.  The shadows are extremely pigmented.  There is surprisingly little fallout from them.  They go on very smoothly and blend beautifully.  Seriously, I cannot think of another eye shadow that I&#x27;ve tried that blends as nicely as these do. I&#x27;m so happy I purchased these.</li>

    <li> Everything was exact and love the product</li>
