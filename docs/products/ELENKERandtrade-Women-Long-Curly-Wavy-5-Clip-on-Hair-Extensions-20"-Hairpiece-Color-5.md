      <li>For the price, this actually seems like a really nice hair piece.</li>

      <li>it looks real, people thought it was my hair.</li>
      <li>but when I have it on it tangles up with my real hair and is a pain to get out..</li>
      <li>I was so excited when I ordered this, but after waiting 30+ days to get it, after I had to call and ask where my order was, it finally came.</li>
      <li>Looks pretty real :) very long and full</li>
      <li>It just came in today which kinda surprised me that it was on the first estimated day</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not that full, or long.</li>
      <li>Although it doesn&#x27;t fit my head properly (bit too wide</li>
      <li>but it can get the job done, if your not going for a natural look.</li>
      <li>I was so pleasantly surprised with these extensions.</li>
      <li>Wow I was surprised when I received my shipment....</li>
      <li>then I put a bow in my hair and it looks like a natural pony tail.</li>
      <li>I straightened it a little to go with my natural waves and it was fine on low heat.</li>

<li> I straightened it a little to go with my natural waves and it was fine on low heat.</li>
<li> The extension itself isn&#x27;t very thick, and it does feel more plastic-y than other synthetic hair I&#x27;ve bought (that have been the same price or even cheaper than this one).</li>
<li> To me, the color changes rather drastically in the light (see pictures).&lt;br /&gt;It held in well for the evening, but I was wary of the edges of the piece, where there are no clips.</li>
<li> The hair was a little too thin, and it tangled easily.</li>
<li> obviously they seem a little thin but to my surprise they are exactly what I hoped for!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not a big deal for me to dye my hair a little darker though, and it may have been my error.</li>
<li> If your hair is thinner or lighter in color, I&#x27;d be careful to continue checking through the time you wear this.&lt;br</li>
<li> Only complaint is that the coloring looks a little different on the computer compared to in person.</li>
<li> I ordered dark brown, and the color was probably two to three shades lighter than what I thought it would be.</li>
<li> For me, they kept curling away from my head, but I have thick hair, so it wasn&#x27;t as big of an issue.</li>
<li> If you plan on wearing your hair down, don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
<li> Came in as described, a bit heavy, though, but maybe they are all like that, have never tried them before.</li>
<li> This clip on lasted me a few months.</li>
<li> The only thing that I have to say negative is that it isn&#x27;t very thick, but other than that</li>
<li> Overall, I&#x27;m not impressed nor will I repurchasing.</li>
<li> but I got two since my hair is very thick.</li>
<li> and they are too thin</li>
<li> I know its fake hair</li>
<li> It was very thin.</li>

    <li> It was very thin. If you plan on wearing your hair down, don&#x27;t buy this. I had to change the way I was going to wear my hair. If you wear your hair in a tight bun and wrap it around to make a ponytail, it looks beautiful.</li>
    <li> This extension is quite shiny and synthetic looking. Its not the greatest but it can get the job done, if your not going for a natural look. I think it would be best used to make a synthetic wig look thicker. The extension itself isn&#x27;t very thick, and it does feel more plastic-y than other synthetic hair I&#x27;ve bought (that have been the same price or even cheaper than this one). Overall, I&#x27;m not impressed nor will I repurchasing.</li>
    <li> Lighter than my actual hair</li>
    <li> Great price  !looks great</li>
    <li> The hair was a little too thin, and it tangled easily. However, lovely color and shine, overall I really like this hair.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I ordered this, but after waiting 30+ days to get it, after I had to call and ask where my order was, it finally came. I opened it, tried it on right away and come to see that the two right clips wouldn&#x27;t clip it my hair. Well never buy from them again. The product sucked.</li>
    <li> Dies not hold up very well...knots easily.</li>
    <li> Wow I was surprised when I received my shipment.... the beauty of these extensions are worth the whole $12.00 dollars I paid....yes ladies what a great price!!!! I bought 2 obviously they seem a little thin but to my surprise they are exactly what I hoped for! I suggest you lay them out as soon as you receive them to avoid any tangles...absolutely satisfied!!!!</li>
    <li> TANGLES SO EASILY!!! I know its fake hair but when I have it on it tangles up with my real hair and is a pain to get out..do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Came in as described, a bit heavy, though, but maybe they are all like that, have never tried them before. They are easy to put in.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my daughters prom hairstyle. Color &amp; curl totally what we wanted and needed. Easy to use &amp; great length</li>
    <li> I was so pleasantly surprised with these extensions. It&#x27;s a very cheap price (Under 6 bucks with shipping) so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much... I got my order within 10 days.  The extensions look and feel very real, and the wave/curl in them is beautiful! They look way better than they even do in the picture. Super easy to put in and take out. Only complaint is that the coloring looks a little different on the computer compared to in person. I got a color that matched my hair online but it quite a bit darker in person. It&#x27;s not a big deal for me to dye my hair a little darker though, and it may have been my error. Overall LOVE THIS!</li>
    <li> It arrived fast &amp; really nice</li>
    <li> it matched my color. it looks real, people thought it was my hair. but it you have a lot of hair you will need more</li>
    <li> I thought this came well packaged for the price, wrapped in a hair net, in a plastic bag. Not too much protection, but the hair wasn&#x27;t too frizzy. I ordered dark brown, and the color was probably two to three shades lighter than what I thought it would be. To me, the color changes rather drastically in the light (see pictures).&lt;br /&gt;It held in well for the evening, but I was wary of the edges of the piece, where there are no clips. For me, they kept curling away from my head, but I have thick hair, so it wasn&#x27;t as big of an issue. If your hair is thinner or lighter in color, I&#x27;d be careful to continue checking through the time you wear this.&lt;br /&gt;It does a great job though, and looked great in pictures (I chose to leave mine down), I placed mine just under the crown.</li>
    <li> For the price, this actually seems like a really nice hair piece. I used it for extra volume in an up-do and it blended with my hair beautifully.</li>
    <li> Was actually better than i thought it would be considering the price.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this! It just came in today which kinda surprised me that it was on the first estimated day and I could not have been happier. Although it doesn&#x27;t fit my head properly (bit too wide so I trimmed the sides) it still looks great :D I straightened it a little to go with my natural waves and it was fine on low heat. I definitely recomend this product</li>
    <li> I bought two and they are too thin, I thought it would be a hair for me but its not. It tangle easily and can only be used once</li>
    <li> The hair was good i have no trouble with the clips, if you try to comb it it will get tangled its not real hair.  The only thing that I have to say negative is that it isn&#x27;t very thick, but other than that it looks very nice!</li>
    <li> Looks pretty real :) very long and full but I got two since my hair is very thick. Beautiful waves but gets tangled easily and sheds. Good if you take care of them really well :)</li>
    <li> There really gooD just wish they would would have said wash with shampoo and condition then brush them and there will be no tangles</li>
    <li> This clip on lasted me a few months. I don&#x27;t recommend brushing it because you&#x27;ll take out the curl. I used it different than the way it&#x27;s supposed to be used. I put my hair in a bun and just line the track around it in a circle. then I put a bow in my hair and it looks like a natural pony tail. I love it! Definitely ordering again.</li>
    <li> Very smooth hair. It&#x27;s not that full, or long. I&#x27;d say its shoulder length if that. But, it&#x27;s so silky and beautiful! I&#x27;m using the hair for a class project in my art class. I&#x27;m making a doll from a Mary Cassatt painting called &#x27;The girl in the big hat&#x27;.</li>
    <li> so excited to get this...i hope it comes soon</li>
