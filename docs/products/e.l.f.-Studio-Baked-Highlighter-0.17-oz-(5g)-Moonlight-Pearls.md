<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product arrived broken. That made me so upset.</li>
    <li> i love this stuff. even gave it to a friend because I wanted her to experience the magnitude of it&#x27;s awesomeness. I&#x27;ll keep buying it for sure!</li>
    <li> Good for those who want a light one. This is just perfect for me. Not too flashy. Not too dull. I love it.</li>
    <li> Not so good...I was expecting more, but is good for the price</li>
    <li> Not too pigmented as it was mentioned but the color looks neat on my skin tone</li>
    <li> All right with the the purchase and delivery.</li>
    <li> Love the coverage and consistency of this product. Will buy elf again! Although it&#x27;s much cheaper on the actual elf site.</li>
    <li> Highlights very well but it doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
    <li> The highlighter is a little too hard  (for some people it might not be a problem) and it gives your  face this odd shimmer (almost sparkly) look.  You&#x27;ll have to blend it really well to soften the look!!! I&#x27;ll probably finish what I have but I&#x27;m not going to buy this again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! It is an excellent highlighter and makes it look like my skin is glowing, especially when the light hits it just right. Will be buying again.</li>
    <li> Looks great, has some shimmer, but fades throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know much time I spend on applying this product... It&#x27;s hard and not all the brushes pick it, sometimes it&#x27;s easier to apply with your finger tips but It doesn&#x27;t show much when I do so, I just look pale</li>
    <li> Beautiful shimmer for flawless glowing looks</li>
    <li> I use it on my cheek bones, above my lip and on the center of my nose. Love it so far and really affordable.</li>
    <li> Very nice, silky smoothe and makes your cheeks &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> The best and even better it&#x27;s cheap!!!</li>
    <li> This highlight works just as well as the high end high price ones</li>
    <li> i was so happy i found a cheap but nice highlighter. When i got it though, it was broken. I will try to salvage it without it going everywhere, but i wasnt pleased when i saw it broken. I ordered other items (nothing heavy) and they used barely any protection.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. It&#x27;s not overly shimmery. It&#x27;s just right. I dab it on my lips sometimes and it&#x27;s beautiful.</li>
    <li> Great Product.  Brightens eyes and cheeks.</li>
    <li> This highlighter is exactly the look I was going for. It&#x27;s awesome. I almost bought a similar much more expensive product but i&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t. This is now a staple in my make up collect. It is shimmery but adds a nice glow.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy save your money</li>
    <li> Completely crushed and powder all over everything, despite the fact that it had a ridiculous amount of packaging. I do like the color and the effect it has for highlighting, but because it&#x27;s broken it&#x27;s extremely difficult to use.</li>
    <li> Wanted to use this was a highlighter for contouring, it is way too sparky for that. Disappointed because I love ELF products.</li>
    <li> shipping was fast, love when it hit the light .. great product! highly recommended</li>
    <li> I LOVE this highlighter, can&#x27;t say enough! Adds the perfect amount of brightness. I like matte foundations, but have dry skin... so my makeup tends to look kinda chalky instead of fresh. This changes everything, adds a real luminous look to my skin. I used this along with Watts Up, by Benefit. Can&#x27;t live without it, especially for the price!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this highlighter it goes great with my fair skin! Can&#x27;t beat the price and there&#x27;s so much product! Definitely a beautiful product. Shipping was so fast and packaging was secure and safe. And the product itself is just great, just a good buy all around.</li>
    <li> Arrived broken but I&#x27;ve been using it anyway. I wanted something with more glow to it. This looks a bit &amp;#34;glittery&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s alright.  I just have to blend it a lot.</li>
    <li> just the right amount of shine! love this product!</li>
    <li> Color is good but does not apply smoothly</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff! Just the type of shimmer I was looking for. Better then hi end makeup!!</li>
    <li> Awesome color.  Stays on all day. Shipping was faast! 😊</li>
    <li> Waste of money ! Horrible product</li>
    <li> Perfect  highlighter goes on velvety smooth and perfect for any skin  tone.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I&#x27;ve even seen it reviewed in a magazine as a great knockoff of a more expensive brand. The only thing is that it broke apart but I definitely love it. I put it under my eyebrows and it hides any hairs I can&#x27;t get with the tweezers &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Such a beautiful highlighter.</li>
    <li> the color is nice and shimmery but it was broken when I received it. still use able though. a little thick but you can work it through.</li>
    <li> This product broke very easily! It is quite annoying. Although when you are able to put it on, it gives a nice dewy affect.</li>
    <li> Was delivered cracked and a mess! Too shiny for my 30 year old self trying to minimize the lines and wrinkles!</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT. It looks gorgeous on your cheeks and as a highlighter under your eyebrow. It&#x27;s so pretty too</li>
    <li> Nice shimmer and not sparkly.</li>
    <li> was a bit too &amp;#34;glittery&amp;#34; rather than shimmery (light diffusing)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this highlighter. It has definitely become one of my favorite things to use. Puts a nice shimmering glow to the face. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> So worth the money really good quality.</li>
    <li> I like this product, but I thought it would be a light pearly color. But besides that I like it.</li>
    <li> Awesome for the price- pigment is great. Love all ELF products thus far</li>
    <li> I love this colour.  It is very pigment with a lil shimmer... It look good with anything you ware..</li>
    <li> As a make up artist, finding a good highlighter is imperative! Use this wet or dry and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> I love it!! It was beautiful and made my face look fresh, clean and chiseled my features to perfection!!</li>
    <li> Its really good and gives shine, but when i got it, it was broken in half. I still used it but had to put it in another circle make up box.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a high quality highligher for next to nothing for a price, then you can stop searching. This is hands down the best highlighter. Even better than a $40 tube.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a must have , its the same highlighter as Mac but a cheaper version.</li>
    <li> Waste of money. No pigment. Does absolutely nothing. :/ bummer</li>
    <li> The product came cracked and on top of that i think it looks really chalky when applied</li>
    <li> Perfect natural highlight/glow finish. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments &amp; people think I have a natural glow before telling them it&#x27;s makeup. On time delivery. Product seems like it&#x27;ll last a very long time. Perfect, I love it!</li>
    <li> I like this stuff a lot. I apply it to my cheekbones and the tip of my nose. I then apply a very light layer to the bridge of my nose, my chin, and my forehead. It&#x27;s subtle. The light catches those features more and makes them stand out which is what I wanted. This is a nice way to make my cheekbones look higher and my nose look more sloped without having to use much product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very light skin by the way.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected but it&#x27;s ok. i use it sometimes!! Fast service!!</li>
    <li> I just received the product. Shipping and delivery time was appropriate. I imagine that I would be satisfied with the product if I was able to use it. However, it is in a few pieces and it is just causing a mess. I would really like to try this as I have been looking for a new highlighter, but I guess this purchase simply did not work out for me. I will update the review if anything else comes of this, but at this time I am definitely not happy with the condition of the product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just the right amount of shimmer you need :)&lt;br /&gt;Really liked this product. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> it is nice and worth to buy.</li>
    <li> Pretty but use a light hand. It is very pigmented.</li>
    <li> This elf highlighter is amazing and very cheap compared to my other highlighter and it works just as good if not better. I definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants to save some money</li>
    <li> (rated by Mrs. OutdoorFamilyMan4)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated: reordered twice. No breaks in product. Nice healthy glow. Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Love the product. It leaves a beautiful glow on my skin. I use it to contour my face along with a bronzer, and the result is stunning.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the top of it broke off. I put the broken portion inside another makeup container so that I didn&#x27;t lose any product but I was disappointed. I ordered it again, but I am prepared in case it happens again.</li>
    <li> Although the color and iridescence is nice I found it too hard to apply, hard being tightly packed and did not transfer to brush easily.</li>
    <li> Very satin. Love the look. Over my mak-up</li>
    <li> Love this. I have to really rub my brush on it to get shimmer, but it looks  beautiful on!</li>
    <li> I like it, but it&#x27;s kind of hard to get it out with a brush. I love how shimmer looks in the highlight and on my face! I might purchase again.</li>
    <li> Product is almost good, I am happy with pigmentation and results but it arrived broken</li>
    <li> it gave me while differnt look, but my product wasnt sent to someone else but they resent it again thank u</li>
    <li> Nothing overly special here. I loved the shine but definitely not as an all over highlighter.. too shimmery. The lid off the top broke within a week - of course it broke inside my makeup bag. My stuff is still shimmery! Be careful with the cheap case.</li>
    <li> Looks great but kind of hard to get to transfer on a brush and can look Cakey with too much! But it&#x27;s worth a try and it&#x27;s not gonna hurt your wallet.</li>
    <li> It was just messy. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Not only is this product great, but it can be used in multiple ways. The best is probably a cheek highlighter, but it&#x27;s a great eyeshadow too. Just be very careful of the amount you use, it can&#x27;t go overboard very quickly.</li>
    <li> Love the transformation achieved with a little swipe of this powder.  Takes years off my face and brightens my eyes.  Don&#x27;t know why it took me all these years to try it.  Get 2 - one for home and one for your purse.</li>
    <li> I have used Highlighter powder before, but this one is light enough that it doesn&#x27;t look heavy handed. I expected it to be &amp;#34;heavier&amp;#34; but that ended up being a benefit because I felt I had more control over my look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s soft, soft-looking, and gives me an extra glow, especially when I am sick (I have chronic illness). I use a thicker blush brush and make the letter &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; around my eye from the brow bone to below the eye. It&#x27;s so delicate and heavenly.</li>
    <li> I got this in all 3 available shades: pink diamonds, moonlight pearls and blush gems and i am so glad I did. The colors are simply amazing, the pigmentation is very very nice! It also does not have any glitter, just a gorgeous sheen - you&#x27;re bound to love these highlighters. Also, they are just $3 each on the ELF website. I&#x27;d recommend these to anyone, they look like high-end highlighters for a super-affordable price!</li>
    <li> I hate the face that it came all broken up and it dumped every where in my purse! Loved it thoe.</li>
    <li> The prodcut arrived totally broken, my wife was really dissappointed with this.</li>
    <li> first time used, didn&#x27;t get enough on the brush.  now that I know you have to really pack it on, it looks very shimmery, and I love it.</li>
    <li> Looks amazing! Gives a beautiful suddle glow</li>
    <li> It was kinda hard to pick up in a brush and doesn&#x27;t shownup unless you really packed it on and it still really wasn&#x27;t that good</li>
    <li> I like the finish it gives off form a far, but when I look at it from my mirror the glitter in it is just too large.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the product for a while now, about 4 months. It&#x27;s not very pigmented and it&#x27;s too cool toned for my complexion. Can hardly transfer the product onto a fan brush or any highlighter brush because it&#x27;s hard (as in the product itself!)</li>
    <li> Use this every day - under my eyes - along the sides of my nose - on my chin - really brightens up your face without looking caked on</li>
    <li> natural highlighter - love the color and will totally buy again and recommend to others.  A variety of skin shades can pull this off</li>
    <li> Not too heavy.  I use it above the cheekbones and on the brow bones for a little extra &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;.  Not too shimmery.  Will definitely by other products by this company.</li>
    <li> You need a really stiff brush to get a decent amount. Love the color though nice and subtle however I wouldnt get it again.</li>
    <li> Love it!! I&#x27;m so glad I ordered it! I have other Elf products that work amazing! I dont always use this mostly only when going out on special occassion but I do love it &amp; I reccommend it!!</li>
    <li> Good highlight I love it</li>
    <li> Bought this and my cousin fell in love... so I gave it to her .. and immediately bought it again~! Gives me that glow</li>
    <li> I like the color but the quality is very low it broke when it arrived color is isn&#x27;t too good .</li>
    <li> Love the product ... terrible packaging design.  Arrived broken ...most of it was unusable.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear highlighter often, but this one is okay.</li>
    <li> This highlighter is only for just what it says &amp;#34;highlighter&amp;#34;, no color at all on my skin.</li>
    <li> Ive been looking for a decently priced high lighter for a long time now, most cheaper brands dont even make one, i was choosing between this and MAC and decided to try this one first before spending the money or the more expensive MAC. im glad i did, its actually better than expected. it lasts for a long time (on your face) and the container it comes in looks pretty. the color is light and shiny. the only thing i am a bit concerned about is how &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; it is, i had to try several brushes before i found one that worked for it, a short, somewhat rough one. i realized that its &amp;#34;baked&amp;#34; so its supposed to be that way, i guess im more of a &amp;#34;loose powder&amp;#34; girl myself. on that note, the container is small so it can get little messy around but .. overall those issues arent that important and im completely happy with, especially for the 7 bucks i paid lol im adding a couple of pictures from the day i got it.</li>
    <li> If you used a powder blush or blush brush, I feel like it is way to sheer and glittery. But when I used my finger and placed where I wanted I thought it worked a little better, even though, I really couldn&#x27;t blend it out. Because it is baked, I thought I would try it wet and on my eyelid just to see what it would look like and I love it! On me, it shows up a nude shimmer and just so very pretty! It really lightens and brightens my eyelids and I feel that it doesn&#x27;t look glittery at all. So while I am happy that I found another use for it, I personally don&#x27;t think it makes a very good highlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it from Sunny Good Morning and didn&#x27;t have a problem with them.</li>
    <li> In MAC I am an NC 45 for reference. I love, love, love the pearl as an eye shadow. It makes me look ashy if places on my cheeks. But it is perfect if I use it under my brow bone. Perfect. Just perfect.</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff!!!!  I don&#x27;t typically write reviews, but after reading all the others reviews, I decided to give this highlighter a try.  It truly is amazing.  I&#x27;m a women of a certain age ;), and this highlighter gives my skin such a youthful glow, I cannot and will not live without it!!!  I put it on my brow bone, cheek bones, tip of my nose and a bit on my chin.  This is one of the best cosmetics that I&#x27;ve used!  Good job e.l.f.!!!</li>
    <li> It was okay. I use it sometimes but like the other highlighter I have better than this one I purchased.</li>
    <li> This looks good if applied lightly. A little too much will ruin my makeup look completely (in my eyes).</li>
    <li> I only use this for highlighting my face after I contour.  It looks very pretty an subtle.  There are no giant flakes of glitter or anything.  My only complaint is that it is very hard to get enough product on my brush for it to show up properly.  I am not experienced with &amp;#34;baked&amp;#34; powders so this may be normal.  Overall, great product for the price and it should last a good while!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty but not what I was expecting in a baked product. I wish it was more pigmented dry than when applied wet. But hey it&#x27;s a cheap buy so idc I like to have it in my kit</li>
    <li> I was worried that this highlighter would not have enough pigment or be too dark for my \\&quot;beige\\&quot; skin but it is perfect. I was wrong on both counts. The first time I wore it my husband asked if I was happy because my face was \\&quot;glowing\\&quot;. I have always used a highlighter without a pearl look because I worry that it will settle in lines. That hasn&#x27;t been a problem with this highlighter. It stays where I put it and doesn&#x27;t show any wrinkles. Although I don&#x27;t have much for wrinles in the places I wear highlighter. Unlike cream highlighter, I have to put this product on after my finishing powder or it seems to disappear. It does,however, last through a lot of blending, touching, kissing and I have seen last eight hours easily. I don&#x27;t work away from home so I haven&#x27;t had the chance to test it any longer than that. It also looks good without foundation, a little blush and mascara.&lt;br /&gt;It also looks great in photos. I have tried a lot of e.l.f. makeup and I am most impressed with this, the Moonlight Pearls Baked Highlighter.</li>
    <li> Very good product just as described</li>
    <li> For the price.. I can&#x27;t really complain. This probably looks better on skin with darker tones than mine. As I have fair skin and Auburn hair. So the product is really hard to see a difference.</li>
    <li> Yet I fall for ordering makeup online and this was no different.  Powder was hard and couldn&#x27;t come of on a brush . I give up.</li>
    <li> No real highlighting when using a brush!  However, when I use my ring finger and place directly where I want, it&#x27;s PERFECT, just perfect and the right amount of highlight, which should be subtle; catches the light beautifully.  Just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> gives a nice hilight but does not last more than a few hours.</li>
    <li> Highly pigmented and very pearly, Also, a little more yellowy than I refer but I can see this looking great on darker skin tones. Easy to apply and a little goes a long ways.</li>
    <li> I am very please with this highlighter... it has a really pretty sheen to it and is the perfect color. It is definitely worth the price for sure!</li>
    <li> This product is okay. It does the job but it is a little cheap and has a lot if filer components... mostly glitter..</li>
    <li> Really shiny, kinda made me look like I had really oily skin. I didn&#x27;t like it as much.</li>
    <li> I have fair skin, and this color is very pretty on me! Shows up better if you use a liquid highlight first, and then apply this powder highlight over it.</li>
    <li> love the shimmer / highlighter i use it as a highlighter every day and i sometimes use it has a highlighter on my eyes as well as cheeks</li>
    <li> The only thing I can complain about with this highlighter is that it leaves a very glittery effect on my face. It almost makes your face look greasy. I&#x27;ve had no problems with skin breakouts, or irritation with this product, but I don&#x27;t think I would get anymore due to the shining effect. The powder also becomes loose very easily, so a lot of product is wasted.</li>
    <li> i love this product its very nice and i love the way it gives light to my cheeckbones i will use it alot . natasha</li>
    <li> I tried using a brush with this, but it didn&#x27;t work at all. I had to use my finger and even then, once I applied it, I couldn&#x27;t blend. It was just a straight line of sparkle on part of my face. Did I mention it was messy? After about two weeks (without use), I lifted it and the top was stuck, so I pushed a bit harder and it popped open. The rounded top of the highlighter slid right off. The fantastic thing about this is that the stuff underneath was easier to use, but even messier. If you have similar issues, in order to save the money you spent, try transferring to a Tupperware container and mashing it into a powder. It works alright now. Also, it sucks the moisture out of my skin. Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> This highlighter is a warm tone. The pay off is wonderful and the price makes me smile. I will repurchase this. I won&#x27;t need high end item anymore.</li>
    <li> This looks super gorgeous as a highlighter on my cheekbones, browbone, cupid&#x27;s bow and on the bridge of my nose. :)</li>
    <li> Great deal for its price. I recommend it. It came very fast and perfect conditions. I will buy it again for sure.</li>
    <li> bought this product to complement some elf blush i had also purchased. I love it for the fact that it highlights my face without using glitter...i don&#x27;t feel like a 10 year old little girl anymore :)</li>
    <li> It came broken but the product was great, not too shiny but good for highlighting</li>
    <li> very nice subtle highlighter, i have used more expensive that didn&#x27;t work as well--I find that elf products are less expensive but not cheaply made</li>
    <li> I really love the soft shimmer this gives my face making for the perfect highlight for an evening out .</li>
    <li> Beautiful! Its actually a dupe for the balm&#x27;s mary louminzer</li>
    <li> I love this and will buy it again. It shipped fast ... no damage what so ever. . Packed in bubble wrap. The product itself is beautiful. Just a hint of a wonderful glow.  Love, love, love it!!</li>
    <li> I wear this daily!! It goes on so nicely, and stays put all day. I&#x27;ve used it every day for a while, and it doesn&#x27;t even look like I&#x27;ve touched it. Looks like it will last a long time :)</li>
    <li> Very nice shine to it. Pearlescent on the skin. Only negative is that it&#x27;s very baked so a bit hard to remove. But that leads to no cracking and no fall out so can be a positive</li>
    <li> I am pretty fair skinned and this gave me just a little shimmer on top of my cheek bones. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Was a little disappointed in the size (smaller than expected), but overall this is a great product. Does not irritate my sensitive skin, great shade and shimmer.</li>
    <li> love!!!!! -This is soo nice on! :-)&lt;br /&gt;its shimmery not glittery, its light enought to wear without foundation.&lt;br /&gt;I cant say love enough!</li>
    <li> Good texture and pigmentation for highlighting</li>
    <li> Loved the highlighting with this product but it irritates my eyes throughout the day.  I put it on my cheekbones but it ends up getting into my eyes.  I had to stop wearing it once I realized this was the cause.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve messed around with quite a few highlighters.. liquids.. creams everything.. This one is amazing really picks up the light and its not glittery big plus.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Highlight is my best friend will buy again</li>
    <li> My wife love&#x27;s this item. I can&#x27;t speak on it, but she keeps buying Elf products, so I&#x27;m guessing it must be good.</li>
    <li> Amazing color payoff great shippibg</li>
    <li> This is BEAUTIFUL!!!!! The highlight is on fleek</li>
    <li> This one is kind of a miss for me. I&#x27;ve never used much highlighter and didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot to try one out, but this one is hard for me to use. The product barely comes off onto my brush. I prefer softer ones, personally, like TooFaced Candlelight, or this Lumi one I just got at Walmart.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color with right amount of sparkle</li>
    <li> I love this! Definitely wouldn&#x27;t mind paying more for this if the prices ever went up!</li>
    <li> Ugh save your money....this is s9ooo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Powdery...it&#x27;s like talcum powder..no thanks....</li>
    <li> Cause it&#x27;s more just glitter not really a high light. It&#x27;s hard to get it on the brush as well.</li>
    <li> Bought this highlighter based on YT reviews....it did not disappoint....</li>
    <li> Gorgeous on cheekbones as well as eyelids. Highlights and illuminates my olive skin tone well. Loved this product a lot :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s baked, so I use a brush with shorter, bristles, kinda stiff, and It&#x27;s beautiful.  The shimmer is longs lasting and gives a natural glow. Love it.</li>
    <li> Awful i can&#x27;t even use it. When i put it on it looks like i am puting brown powder on my cheecks the shine is awful too i hate this item.</li>
    <li> Using it for highlighting for a wedding. I don&#x27;t typically wear a lot of makeup so i can&#x27;t compare it to other highlighters. it&#x27;s really hard to get the stuff on the brush, but when it goes on, it looks like the perfect color.</li>
    <li> I still use this product,  but no, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.  I will switch brands. It isn&#x27;t exactly a smooth power.  It is more of eyeshadow. If you have ever gotten eyeshadow on your check or face you&#x27;ll know what I&#x27;m talking about.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It gives you the perfect glow</li>
    <li> I like this product and would like to get the other colors</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used baked eye shadow in the past (Laura Geller) and will stick with Laura Geller!  (More expensive but better product.)&lt;br /&gt;Unimpressed with this eye shadow as it went on &#x27;clumpy&#x27; for me and hard to blend in.&lt;br /&gt;And don&#x27;t drop it!  Dropped it once and shadow was unuable after that as it was in too many pieces!</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed! I just got this baked highlighter in the mail and I opened the packaging box and the product was completely shattered and spilled everywhere. Now I cant even use the product.</li>
    <li> Very pretty highlight</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the best quality, but it works well enough for the price.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast. I find the product okay not great.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it. Does not give my skin any glow.</li>
    <li> As a woman with very pale skin, this is exactly what I was looking for!  It doesn&#x27;t add any extra color to my skin, just a delightful subtle shimmer.  After blending well with a brush, it doesn&#x27;t look at all glittery.  I use my fingers to apply first, then blend, since the brush doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to pick up a lot of product.  Not a big deal though, for the amount I paid, I don&#x27;t expect super pigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is excellent for the price.</li>
    <li> It came broken. I suggest wrapping it in protective plastic.</li>
    <li> I love this highlighter, I use it on my cheeks and it gives me a radiant glow that Ive have been complimented on, you look so much more alert and alive with this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve looked for a nice subtle highlighter for quite some time and have tried numerous products.  This product is excellent.  It goes on smooth and silky and lasts throughout the day. No refreshing needed and the color is beautiful.</li>
    <li> My favorite highlighter EVER. I&#x27;m pale and a redhead, and the last thing I want is reddish tones all up on my face. This helps me perfect the slightly tanned, normal-skin-look I wish I had.</li>
    <li> the whole thing crumbled and fell off the container... didn&#x27;t even show up on my skin. a waste of money</li>
    <li> I use this directly under my eyebrows and it really gives them a more defined look.  It is also a great base if you want your eyeshadow to look brighter.</li>
    <li> Love this!! I use this highligter Everyday! It is comprable to the Mac Highlighter at a much more affordable price!</li>
    <li> What a find!  This highlighter is just a tad on the white side, but otherwise is perfect.  Apply carefully with a brush (don&#x27;t ladle it on) in a &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; shape around the upper cheek bone to the eyebrow.  Buff it in well.  I like it best over powder blush.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, perfect color for me</li>
    <li> It was broken and the shimmer was all over my other products that I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
    <li> Very unhappy about this order. It came completely broken and I can&#x27;t even return it.</li>
    <li> Love these studio baked highlighters!</li>
    <li> This is great for a subtle, dewey glow.  I say it is one of my favorite go to highlighters now that I&#x27;ve tried, and I would buy again.</li>
    <li> This product is the perfect amount of shimmery I use it on my eyebrow bone and cheek bones I literally can&#x27;t do my makeup with out it I&#x27;ve used it for 6 months or so and now am going to buy more! It&#x27;s powdery and with liquid foundation it really gives you appropriate shine . Looks really clean and expensive !</li>
    <li> Beautiful Finish and color!-  Fun to apply!</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a highlighter for my face.  Application is great but I think it would be easy to over do it if you are in a hurry or have no idea what you are doing.  It does lean more on the shimmer side and not so much as a highlighter.  This product is best served as an evening highlighter to give you the candle light glow.</li>
    <li> Great for overall highlighting, especially at the price!</li>
    <li> I recieved my studio baked highlighter and I love it.It gives my face some shimmer to it and looks great.Good Product.I will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> Nice, but use sparingly over foundation and blush or bronzer.  Very nice. Recommended</li>
    <li> Totally cracked and fell apart the first time I used it</li>
    <li> GREAT COLOR AND NICE TO USE.  WOULD DEFINITELY GET IT AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product.!! Came faster than I thought and I even got a nice &amp;#34;thank you&amp;#34; card in it.!</li>
    <li> Not what I was hoping for. Was looking for a looser powder</li>
    <li> Beautiful highlight but it came broken and was a mess when I took it out the box.</li>
    <li> Used to be cheap, went to buy this product again and they really upped the price. It was a decent highlighter for the price but I will have to look for something else.</li>
    <li> So here&#x27;s the deal ladies, this product is just all around wonderful. If you&#x27;re a beginner elf cosmetics is the way to go because its not only inexpensive but it give you the satisfaction that you&#x27;re looking for. Now you can use this product to highlight the (brow area {eyebrows}, cheekbones, and under eye area). Personally I just use it to highlight my cheek bones because I feel that it gives me that nice sunkissed look. It&#x27;s important that when you&#x27;re applying the product to becareful because a little can go a long way. SERIOUSLY!!!! Comparing this product to MAC, NARS, and Kat Von D&#x27;s highlighters, I&#x27;d say this is the best and now ONLY highlighter that I am using at the moment, Aside for that, the elf baked highlighter usually ranges from $3-6 at Target and Elf Cosmetics store. If you buy this product I swear you&#x27;ll be satisfied.</li>
    <li> A bit disappointed because when i got the product its cracked!</li>
    <li> does not really show up</li>
    <li> I loved this product its a nice color and blends easily I gave it 4 stars because I hoped it would&#x27;ve be a little easier to get the product on the brush it isn&#x27;t as loose as I would&#x27;ve liked but overall a really nice product.</li>
    <li> I just love this color and it applies so nice, Elf is my new favorite</li>
    <li> I find that this highlighter gives a very artificial shimmer instead of a natural glow. The highlighter is hard and not very pigmented.</li>
    <li> I bought this in moonlight pearls to use as a highlight on my cheekbone, and it does the trick perfectly! I did not have to bear down hard to get the color on my angled brush - a light sweep worked just fine - and the glow it left was subtle and lovely. This is a new favorite for me.</li>
    <li> Weird kinda highlights, if you like that sort of thing.</li>
    <li> This HIGHLIGHTER IS SUPERB ,EVEN when you do black and white photos you can see how well it works.</li>
    <li> The product is great but does not travel well I bought two of these at two different times and both were broken when I opened them so I just use it as a loos powder still works great</li>
    <li> IT GIVES ME THAT GLOW.</li>
    <li> I love this highlighter! It&#x27;s not to shimmery or glittery and it goes on perfectly in the skin for just the right amount if glow. I would def recommend to anyone to use as a highlighter! I would and have recommend(ed) elf products for everyone to try at least once.</li>
    <li> WOW talk about highlight and shimmer! Perfect highlighter for cool undertone skin.</li>
    <li> The only bad thing is the price for the amount of product you get. It&#x27;s the size of a mac eyeshadow, I thought it would be a lot bigger. Like the size of a bronzer. For what your pissing it should be bigger</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see anything when I put it on.</li>
    <li> Love this but I have to get the elf stipple brush</li>
    <li> Love it. Subtle but effective highlighter.</li>
    <li> Again elf hit the nail on the head with this product infact I like it better than my mac one I&#x27;d recommend this to everyone and the price again I&#x27;d amazing!</li>
    <li> very pretty, you do need to apply wet however to get most color then dry over it if wanted</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I read other people&#x27;s review that you have to use your fingers and not a brush and now i&#x27;m using it everyday.  I really love this product especially for the price of it.  I will order again for me and my sisters!</li>
    <li> this is nice not a lot of glittery shimmer like some others out there. Can use this during the day without it looking like you have a fake glow.</li>
    <li> Good product, slightly frosty but still good on the cheeks.</li>
    <li> Used on my cheekbones as a highlight and it has a beautiful and settle shimmer to it, powder worked best applied by fingers than by brush</li>
    <li> I love this highlighter! I do contouring every day! and this works great for me! It is easy to use! It gives my skin gloving look with out extra shine</li>
    <li> Although my product arrived damaged, I do like it.  It does add a bit of highlighting, and does not make me look like the Tin Man.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful! I use it all the time and it is my favorite highlighter. I have recommended this product to friends and they love it too!</li>
    <li> I adore this highlighter. I have a very pink and pale skin tone and this works well with it. People always notice that I have more of a glow when I wear it. Buy it!</li>
    <li> This is a great highlighting color. It has a slight shimmer which is a nice benefit.</li>
    <li> Nice highlighter,goes on nice and subtle, blends well.would buy again.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t use it yet. But looks great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s actually hard to see when I apply it.  It&#x27;s pretty but when I put it on I can&#x27;t see it.  Don&#x27;t know if others see it or not.</li>
    <li> Nice without adding a over the top shimmer to the face. Just adds a nice glow.</li>
    <li> This product also came through damaged.... the top looked like it was sliced open... the package it was in looked like someone had sat on it and crushed it... this is a good product though.. really give you a glow</li>
    <li> This highlighter is absolutely beautiful! I was very surprised at how it glowed. Definitely awesome for the price. Only thing is, I never read the specs and was expecting a larger compact. Not a big deal since it wasn&#x27;t expensice. Will reorder</li>
    <li> Nice color and easy to blend naturally.</li>
    <li> Holy Grail Highlighter</li>
    <li> very hard to get the powder to transfer on to anything unless i scrape it up and mix it with water</li>
    <li> its a pretty color, just like in the pic. its not very dramatic yet it looks fancy and really pretty</li>
    <li> This product is super nice, I love the nice natural high light that appears. And it last me a pretty long time I&#x27;ve had it for almost 6 months and it&#x27;s amazing, still have plenty like new. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This highlighter is EVERY BIT as good as Macs Mineralized Skinfinish. But better!  The price is ridiculously inexpensive. The effect is gorgeous. Like a glow. Not a disco ball. Your skin simply looks soft pretty and glowing. It&#x27;s small but a substantial amount. Could easily last a year or more. I got MOONLIGHT PEARLS and the shade is gorgeous!!&lt;br /&gt;U cannot go wrong w this..,in any way. If you&#x27;re looking for a highlighter get this. U will not regret it!  That&#x27;s a promise!!</li>
    <li> I love this highlighter. It is very bright and shimmery without being too glittery looking. It&#x27;s beautiful as an eyeshadow base color as well. Perfect for summertime!</li>
    <li> I REALLY REALLY like this highlighter. It goes onto your brush very light, so you have to build it up and swatch over your face a few times. I like this, as I&#x27;d rather build a product up rather than have it be like a disco-ball after just one sweep on my cheek. The packaging is compact and cute. It has some &amp;#34;shimmer&amp;#34; in it, which I like but I know some people don&#x27;t like that. When I say shimmer, I don&#x27;t mean chunks of glitter or sparkles either, very subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have dry, sensitive skin. This product didn&#x27;t irritate me at all and applied very smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on buying this again, or buy the same product in a different color.</li>
    <li> This product is a must for any cosplayer/beauty enthusiast! It leaves the perfect amount of shimmer to perfectly highlight the face. Plus this shade works well for all skin tones. I will probably just buy it in the store next time tough.</li>
    <li> I like this highlighter more than Benefit&#x27;s High Beam highlighter. The package arrived much sooner than expected.</li>
    <li> Great product.  It adds a nice glow- the price is really good compared to similar products</li>
    <li> Great product! Super fast shipping! Very happy!</li>
    <li> Good product especially for the price</li>
    <li> everything I expected except it was a little darker...but not on the skin (: I  love it. is very shiny but that&#x27;s what I wanted (I just don&#x27;t use very much) love it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s way to hard doesn&#x27;t come out in the brush. I have to use my finger so it barely does anything but it&#x27;s pretty so I&#x27;ll keep it.</li>
    <li> Worst elf product I have ever bought. It is not like any baked highlighter I have used before. Very dry, perhaps its old.</li>
    <li> Im really sorry for the mistake I made... btw I love my highlighter</li>
    <li> Very pretty. Works well</li>
    <li> It got good reviews so I ordered this one and a pink one. I was extremely disappointed. But you get what you pay for I guess</li>
    <li> I use this high lite every single day! It&#x27;s great on the brow bone and in the inner corner and above the blush line. I can&#x27;t believe the quality and the amount you get in the pan. I am in love!</li>
    <li> use it as an easy final highlighter, works great!</li>
    <li> I ordered this on Wednesday and I got it today(Saturday) in the mail. Impressed with the speedy delivery! The product is good but you do need to have somewhat of a lot for it to really show. I have purchased other highlighters and this one is by far the best I have ever used on my face. Worth trying. Just use a little more than you would typicaly to really get the full effect.</li>
    <li> Not for Carmel to medium or dark skinned people, this is my updated review and this product does nothing and it doesn&#x27;t show at all, maybe on white pale skin but not for me it my ethnic friends it&#x27;s garbage</li>
    <li> I love this stuff makes my face very shiny</li>
    <li> Bought this, with 0 experiences of using a highlighter. I have medium/fairly dark skin and it highlighted perfectly and so effortlessly. Amazing! Will definitely buy the others</li>
    <li> I received this and it was completely broken. The only reason I bought it was because mine was already broken. #pissed</li>
    <li> love the color but came broken</li>
    <li> 3 star because it came in brooken :(</li>
    <li> Nice product, nice shimmer .</li>
    <li> Elf studio baked highlighter: this is really neat! The only problems I had with it are that it kinda shows up more of a warm beige on it pic but when I received mine it was more white. However it is still really great! Also if ur thinking this is slightly creamy it is not. It&#x27;s dry as a bone which makes it a little harder to apply since it had no moisture to make it cling to ur skin. Arrived on time and neatly packaged. All in all, I give it a thumbs up ☺️</li>
    <li> It highlights what I want highlighted. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> love this! e.l.f never lets me down. it gives a nice glow to the cheeks.</li>
    <li> This is very pretty and gives you a glow but you really have to work your brush in to get it to apply.</li>
    <li> Its just ok. This would have gotten 2 stars but the shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> Awesome highlighter .&lt;br /&gt;Of course I use it for contouring and it works amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts maybe a good 5 hours.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t put compact over it,&lt;br /&gt;It seems to fade away if you do.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, 5 stars .</li>
    <li> My favorite highlighter! It adds the perfect amount of shimmer without being glittery (exactly what I was hoping for). Baked palettes last me a super long time, so I see myself only needing 1 or 2 of these every year. Awesome.</li>
    <li> I have very, very light skin with pink undertones and this highlighter really helps with getting rid of the rosy pink color that usually dawns my cheeks. It&#x27;s really light and shimmery and adds a natural looking glow to my skin, which I adore. If you&#x27;re looking for a product that isn&#x27;t too heavy and that adds just a little bit of shimmer to your face then I would definitely try this one out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very light,  wish i got one a little darker.  Nonetheless good buy</li>
    <li> Its light. It is like pearls in a way, and can be built up if that&#x27;s what you want. It lasts a very long time even though it looks small at first glance, and that&#x27;s with everyday use on the bridge of the nose and cheek bones on a medium heaviness. It doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation and is very smooth. Not talcy and scratchy like some powders. Best when applied with a bronzer brush/ powder brush of some sort.</li>
    <li> Love it the price is fantastic I&#x27;ve spent more and gotton less and it works just as well as the more expensive ones for highlighting those areas.I&#x27;ll order again</li>
    <li> It come all broken I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Its very small but its still very nice and i use it every day</li>
    <li> The shimmer is beautiful and natural looking. Its not over bearing it just gives you a nice natural glow.</li>
    <li> Love this highlight its just perfect it gives the perfect shine</li>
    <li> Looks and feels chalkey. Not all that great.</li>
    <li> Every elf product I&#x27;ve tried is good, this one is no exception. A very subtle highlighter, and I&#x27;m always surprised at how long it stays on my somewhat oily face.</li>
    <li> Always use their stuff</li>
    <li> Very pretty shine and color.</li>
    <li> At first I didn&#x27;t see a difference, but then I realized that it can&#x27;t really be seen right away.  Since it&#x27;s a light reflector, you see it when you angle your face and in pictures.  It works perfectly, and I love it! Don&#x27;t be discouraged if you can&#x27;t see it while you are putting it on--just start moving your face around and you&#x27;ll see the highlight.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last all day, and its a bit dry--probably how most powders are.  It&#x27;s baked.</li>
    <li> I love this product ! It gives me a nice healthy glow and doesn&#x27;t break me out.  I will definitely repurchase and recommend to anyone looking for a cheap highlighter. For best application, use a smaller more precise brush such as an eyeshadow brush. It stops it from going all over your face.</li>
    <li> Too dry. Product was too hard and brush couldn&#x27;t pick up powder.</li>
    <li> For a cheap item the shimmer is just enough. Not crazy shimmery but a great reflective highlighter.</li>
    <li> Came broken. Had to return.</li>
    <li> Hard to get on brush and then when you do you get way to much of a highlight because you had to press so hard... Pretty when it works though</li>
    <li> very good , I love it</li>
    <li> Happy with my oder love it</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and I love this highligter</li>
    <li> Not great, I was looking for something that would lightly dust on with one of those whispy brushes but this you have to scrape with a firm cosmetic brush to get on and then it applies too heavily.  I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> Received product broken in pieces</li>
    <li> I really like this highlight. It gives a nice shimmery glow to your face. Very pretty. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is bc I received it broken :/</li>
    <li> A bit dry, but easily workable wet or dry. No one wants to look like a sparkle fest, so it leaves just enough sheen for what I like. You can always add more layers if desired. It highlights the cheekbones in an attractive way. I&#x27;d order again.</li>
