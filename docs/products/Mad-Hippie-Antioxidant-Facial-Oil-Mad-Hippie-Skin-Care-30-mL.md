      <li>Need I say more.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>I mix a couple drops in with my moisturizer and it&#x27;s fantastic!  </li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t absorb at all on my skin if I wear it alone or on top of a moisturizer like directed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I love this antioxidant oil.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise I would not be able to wear it.</li>
      <li>I really love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>, it seems to give me more of a brightening effect than when I&#x27;ve used argan oil alone.</li>
      <li>Great moisturizer for sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>It has really increased my desire to buy more of this stuff!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my nails just from applying it to my face.</li>
      <li>Not only do all the ingredients provide great benefits</li>
      <li>Not as smooth as I thought it would be.</li>
      <li>Great daily moisturizer</li>
      <li>wake up with my face all super greasy and with residue stains on my pillow case and sheets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My face is pretty wrinkled, but this oil smooths most of the lines and it really lasts throughout the day.</li>
      <li>I had initially trialed layering on more moisturizers on to stop the burning and stop my acne but to no avail; nothing worked until I tried this oil!</li>
      <li>I will continue to buy this oil, just wish it absorbed into my skin a bit quicker.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s nice to have them already mixed in the right ratio for me.  </li>
      <li>I use it under a moisturizer and it makes my skin smooth and soft.  </li>
      <li>I am not 100% sure it doesn&#x27;t clog pores, but used judiciously for the correct reasons it definitely has benefits.</li>
      <li>Oil leaked - top does not close properly.</li>
      <li>I was new into using oils on my face and tried to make my own concoction with individual oils when I discovered this one.  </li>
      <li>This facial oil absorbed into my skin leaving it very moisturized and fresh!</li>
      <li>This works really well for oily, shine prone and dehydrated skin with enlarged pores.</li>
      <li>My psoriasis patch, while still visible, is much improved.  </li>
      <li>2-3 drops  covers my whole face.</li>
      <li>I am 55, and everyone thinks my 8 year old granddaughter is my daughter!!  </li>
      <li>is mix a few drops with their face cream (which I absolutely love).</li>
      <li>I live in hawaii</li>
      <li>started this oil as a last-ditch effort when I noticed that my eczematous, dehydrated, sensitive, acneic skin started burning with BHA application.</li>
      <li>and I wake up with a soft, but not greasy, face.  </li>
      <li>My skin is soft and supple</li>
      <li>The oil isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; in the least, my skin absorbs it quickly and thirstily, it really smooths and makes my neck silky and soft.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it if you are looking for a facial serum.</li>
      <li>and I do think it works, at least a heck of a lot better than the other moisturizers and products I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
      <li>Unlike other facial oils, this one from Mad Hippie absorbs into the skin leaving a beautiful satin finish (not a high-gloss shine).</li>
      <li>I do notice that due to the high argan oil content (it is the first ingredient in this oil) that it has the nutty, earthy smell of argan; however due to the other included oils (such as pomegranate oil)</li>

<li> use this in conjunction with the Mad Hippie face wash, C Serum and A Serum.  </li>
<li> I spilled my bottle and a bunch spilled out :(.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> excellent quality, my skin looks amazing</li>
    <li> This works really well for oily, shine prone and dehydrated skin with enlarged pores. Can be used under sunscreen and make-up. I do not require an additional moisturizer after using using this oil. My skin appears plumper. It is not a miracle product but definitely well above average. 2-3 drops  covers my whole face.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer for sensitive skin.  Perfect for winter months!</li>
    <li> I love this face oil!! Been using it for about 2 years &amp; keep reordering. Living in Texas my skin needs that boost at night to repair &amp; I feel this does the job.</li>
    <li> I am 55, and everyone thinks my 8 year old granddaughter is my daughter!!  Need I say more.  My skin is soft and supple</li>
    <li> Unlike other facial oils, this one from Mad Hippie absorbs into the skin leaving a beautiful satin finish (not a high-gloss shine). My face is pretty wrinkled, but this oil smooths most of the lines and it really lasts throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff.  The oil isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; in the least, my skin absorbs it quickly and thirstily, it really smooths and makes my neck silky and soft.  I only use it there as I worry about putting anything oily on my face, but being 40 I wanted to find something wonderful to reduce and prevent my neck from wrinkling and this does it!  I&#x27;ve used it over a year now and I do think it works, at least a heck of a lot better than the other moisturizers and products I&#x27;ve purchased. Plus, over a year and on the same bottle, just about to buy my second before I get too low, so can&#x27;t beat the $!</li>
    <li> Not as smooth as I thought it would be. It&#x27;s kind of sticky and it has a bit of a smell to it. And if you use it under CC cream the cc cream kind of peels off !</li>
    <li> I love this antioxidant oil.  I use it under a moisturizer and it makes my skin smooth and soft.  It is not greasy and I do not break out from it.  I highly recommend it if you are looking for a facial serum.</li>
    <li> Gotta love the name!!! It has really increased my desire to buy more of this stuff!  It feels wonderful and I will continue to use all of this company&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> This review was written by my wife.&lt;br /&gt;I started this oil as a last-ditch effort when I noticed that my eczematous, dehydrated, sensitive, acneic skin started burning with BHA application. I had initially trialed layering on more moisturizers on to stop the burning and stop my acne but to no avail; nothing worked until I tried this oil! I do notice that due to the high argan oil content (it is the first ingredient in this oil) that it has the nutty, earthy smell of argan; however due to the other included oils (such as pomegranate oil), it seems to give me more of a brightening effect than when I&#x27;ve used argan oil alone. I have been using it (a few drops at a time) both day and night, and although it initially gives an oilier look, it does sink in and it does well under my sunblock. Love this for saving my skin!</li>
    <li> I was a little worried about trying a facial oil but I am very glad I did! This facial oil absorbed into my skin leaving it very moisturized and fresh!</li>
    <li> Great daily moisturizer</li>
    <li> There seems to be some benefit. I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my nails just from applying it to my face. I am not 100% sure it doesn&#x27;t clog pores, but used judiciously for the correct reasons it definitely has benefits.</li>
    <li> So unhappy with this. Oil leaked - top does not close properly.</li>
    <li> I was new into using oils on my face and tried to make my own concoction with individual oils when I discovered this one.  Not only do all the ingredients provide great benefits, it&#x27;s nice to have them already mixed in the right ratio for me.  It&#x27;s non-irritating, has a pleasant scent, and gives me great skincare benefits.  I apply it every night as the last step in my bedtime routine and I wake up with a soft, but not greasy, face.  So glad I found this one!</li>
    <li> Love mad hippie!  I mix a couple drops in with my moisturizer and it&#x27;s fantastic!  I live in hawaii and I&#x27;m in the sun A LOT. This oil brings my skin back to life!  On a sad note....I spilled my bottle and a bunch spilled out :(.  If you don&#x27;t spill it, one bottle will go a very long way!  Buy it!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I seen such an improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> I know it&#x27;s oil but it doesn&#x27;t absorb at all on my skin if I wear it alone or on top of a moisturizer like directed.&lt;br /&gt;I wake up with my face all super greasy and with residue stains on my pillow case and sheets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do instead is mix a few drops with their face cream (which I absolutely love). Otherwise I would not be able to wear it. I will definitely not purchase again-</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and also a psoriasis patch by my ear.  I started using this oil a week ago, and my skin is feeling great.  My psoriasis patch, while still visible, is much improved.  My only complaint is that it takes forever to soak into my skin.  I can&#x27;t use it in the morning because it looks like I rubbed baby oil all over my face, and this oily look lasts for hours!  I have to use it at night...and well before going to bed so that it doesn&#x27;t end up all over my pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this in conjunction with the Mad Hippie face wash, C Serum and A Serum.  I will continue to buy this oil, just wish it absorbed into my skin a bit quicker.</li>
