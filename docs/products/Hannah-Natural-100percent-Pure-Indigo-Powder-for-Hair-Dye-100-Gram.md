      <li>Love how my hair feels after using it and</li>
      <li>I was hoping for a darker shade but what I now have is a lighter brown which is ok.</li>

      <li>but for the hours you invest in this process, I would like to see better results.</li>

      <li>and I love it</li>
      <li>I tried it in many ways and nothing.</li>

      <li>Make sure you rinse it ALL OUT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Indigo also stains but has a more blue/green stain than the henna.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gonna feel hot,but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s nothing more to say.  </li>

      <li>Great product, color saturates into the hair very well.  </li>

      <li>Beautiful, soft shiny hair.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really beautiful looking and natural.</li>
      <li>This is a great natural product.</li>
      <li>I used Henna For Hair&#x27;s free pdf book on it which was a great help by the way for people who don&#x27;t know there way out of a paper bag with natural hair</li>
      <li>Even my hair dresser sister loved it and said how natural and healthy it looked.</li>
      <li>so I can mix it 50/50 with the henna to make a beautiful chocolate brown hair with red highlights in the sun.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> High quality -- makes a very fine paste.</li>
    <li> Any Henna is no treat to put on, but totally worth it.  And i love the earthy smell.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t cover my grays.  I&#x27;ll reapply it today and hope it would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worked perfectly.  Maybe I didn&#x27;t do it right the first time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fresh, natural and it works!  There&#x27;s nothing more to say.  It&#x27;s the best Hennah and Indigo.</li>
    <li> This stuff is army green.  The name &amp;#34;indigo&amp;#34; is a misnomer as it implies a color of the same name.  Very confusing.  Maybe all indigo imparts army green and this brand of indigo is fine quality; in that case, it deserves a good review.  But I am in need of a dye that is actually indigo in color.</li>
    <li> Its great. Love how my hair feels after using it and the color is Awsome. Best part is it better for you then any chemical hair color out there. Takes more time but it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> It does not cover grays properly, maybe this product is old. I&#x27;ve used it several times and it did not cover my grays well at all.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! I use it with henna and alma to achieve a dark brown color. The mix leaves my hair soft and shiny. Love it!</li>
    <li> It was a new product it was okay</li>
    <li> Good quality Indigo at an excellent price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mixing and applying henndigo is not simple but if you know what you&#x27;re doing you will get lovely results.</li>
    <li> I use this product for hair. I am rating it 3 stars because it&#x27;s average, not bad not good.&lt;br /&gt;Inside the box, there is a little bag. For this price, there should be a little more.</li>
    <li> A quality henna that goes a long way and the color results are just as what is promised on the box.</li>
    <li> After doing the henna process, I applied this and waited about 2 hours. Everything literally just washed down the drain and never dyed a single strand. The greys were still orange from the henna, so the excuse I gave was that it could pass for highlights but I really wanted them black :(&lt;br /&gt;Although based on the instructions it does say it takes at least 2 applications for the hair to turn completely black. However if it all just washes out like the first time, It would be an unfortunate waste of money especially since this was an add on item ( I would be really upset). I will update when I have complete the 2nd application.</li>
    <li> This imparts a blue color to hair. I use this after henna to get black color. It works well. But the process is lengthy and cumbersome. But I don&#x27;t really have a choice because I don&#x27;t want to use highly toxic chemical hair colors.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of natural hair dye and I find it unbelievable that I can dye my hair black and it will stay black and fade very slowly.  However, the 2 step dye process with henna and indigo is not always a sure thing for me.  Sometimes the indigo just won&#x27;t take,  it just all washes down the drain and I always wonder what went wrong.  The first time I used this I tested it to make sure the dye was releasing,  I put a corner of a paper towel in the mixture so it could draw up the blue dye.  The towel took up the dye sufficiently so I thought I was good to go.  However after an hour of letting the mixture sit on my head it just all washed down the drain and hardly dyed my hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think that this was necessarily the products fault, the brand I bought in the past had about a 50% failure rate, half the time it worked beautifully and half the time not at all, so it will probably work next time, I have bought two more boxes and I  and hoping for the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing, the instructions included in the box are terrible. They make it sound like you can dye your hair with just indigo.  You need to dye your hair with henna first and then dye it with indigo if you want black.  The indigo sticks to the henna somehow.  You can also mix the henna and indigo together and get brown and that is a quicker one step process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update -  I have gotten this to dye my hair.  As always, I have about a 50% success rate with all of the indigo I buy.</li>
    <li> I used about 300g of this product for my hair (a fair warning it is an add on item so I had to buy 600g in total). My hair is about under my chest length. The directions aren&#x27;t very good so you kind of have to know what you&#x27;re doing before you put this in your hair. There are a lot of resources on the internet with directions on how to achieve the hair color you want using henna and indigo. I used Henna For Hair&#x27;s free pdf book on it which was a great help by the way for people who don&#x27;t know there way out of a paper bag with natural hair dyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I waited two hours for the dye to release in the mixture (this was a combination of lemon/lime juice, hot water, and henna powder from my local indian grocery store), Then I put the 300g of Henna mixture on my head. I then proceeded to saran wrapped my head with the gunk and went to bed. In the morning I washed it all out. Then while letting my hair dry, I mixed up 300 grams of indigo, hot water, and two teaspoons of salt (apparently this helps the dye catch for stubborn strands). You should not wait for dye release like you do henna and you should have someone help you put it in your hair as soon as you mix it. I waited about two hours really. Then I washed it out. It was literally like a black ink pen exploded in my shower hahaha. After the messy wash out my hair was a lovely, shiny, and healthy blue-black color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some Notes:&lt;br /&gt;If you want to get black hair with this it will be a two step process like I did with the henna and indigo. If you mix them together you will get a softer black or a dark brown instead.&lt;br /&gt;Kinda smells like spinach. But what do you expect?&lt;br /&gt;It is literally the hardest thing to put in your hair like my sister was complaining the entire time and so was I because the dye kept rolling off in balls onto my shoulders. It takes a lot of patience, time, and a well covered floor.&lt;br /&gt;If you are willing to do this the right way you will get wonderful beautiful results. Your hair will thank you. C:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On how long the color lasts? I guess I will just have to find out. Apparently you can touch up the color with a mixture of 10% henna and 90% indigo though. :D</li>
    <li> In over a decade of ordering things on Amazon, this is the first time I have ever hated a product so much that I felt compelled to write a review. This product is totally and completely USELESS. I was already buying a number of other things at the time, and this was a cheap add-on item so I figured - why not? What&#x27;s the harm in just trying it out? Maybe all the other people who wrote terrible reviews just didn&#x27;t know what they were doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I should have heeded those other terrible reviews. This product is an utter waste of time and money. I have been dying my hair with henna for a while now, so I am familiar with the process. I tried using the indigo powder in conjunction with the henna MULTIPLE ways after extensive research online, and nothing worked. Save yourself the hassle and don&#x27;t bother giving this product a try.</li>
    <li> I really love the black color that this product provides for my hair. It does the job perfectly every time when I first apply the henna color by this same brand and then this one to get the black color I desire. I will definitely keep buying this product as a more natural way to cover my grey strands.</li>
    <li> The color is too light to cover the gray hair. After five or six washes, it began to fade fast.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cover white hairs. At least dleant work on my hair.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all on my hair no color no treatment no nothing .it just made it smell like weed.</li>
    <li> I mix it with henna to achieve a dark brown color. The negative is I have to keep the product on for 6 hours since I have thick hair.</li>
    <li> I have curly brown hair that shudders and dies when it comes in contact with any product that contains hydrogen peroxide. So I cover my grays with a henna/indigo combination. I prepare my Henna the night before, since it needs to cure for a few hours, and then mix up this indigo powder and combine the two. The dying process takes several hours and is messy but the result is my original brown hair with nice, warm chestnut highlights that result form the gray getting covered.</li>
    <li> Great and as described. It was fresh and made a notice difference in my hair each time I used it (once mixed with henna, another time applied after henna application). I will be buying more from this seller as I have ran out!</li>
    <li> I use this to counter the red tones I get from using henna as a conditioner. It is silky smooth, fine and mixes perfectly. I wouldn&#x27;t be able to condition with henna if not for this beautiful indigo powder to keep me from looking like Little Orphan Annie. I am very satisfied with my purchase. Have purchased several times and quality is always A-1. Buy with confidence!</li>
    <li> used this to darken my hair after i henna&#x27;ed it, it brought down my red hair thank god. Very reliable product.</li>
    <li> Like the Hannah Natural brand natural hair coloring products.  Have had a reaction to regular hair dye, so enjoy being able to use natural products to color hair.</li>
    <li> I have been coloring my grey hair since high school.  I used chemicals before and always had dry dandruff, hair fall and recently started to put mehndi (henna) again.  Indigo after henna gives perfect dark brown shade with auburn highlights.  I have to apply it once every 4 weeks but 21 days will be ideal.  I put henna first for 3 hrs and follow it with indigo for 90 mins.  There are some tips and tricks to do it perfectly.  My hair are also growing and look thick.  So happy with the product and I hope it has no long term side effects like artificial hair salon products have.</li>
    <li> maybe it takes 2 or more applications to made your hair blue? In any case it made my hair a shiny black from its usual dark brown.</li>
    <li> I actually purchased this for my Mom that wanted to use a natural way to color her hair. She mixed this with Henna and got excellent results. She is very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Works great for my hair! Will continue use both Hannah and indigo for my hair!</li>
    <li> Never going back to chemicals again!  I have been experimenting with henna for a few months now, until I finally discovered the perfect method for me.  I would always get the red tones in my hair just using the henna alone till I discovered indigo.  If you want a natural black and cover up the grays- you need to do the two step process with henna and indigo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Mix the henna with a few teaspoons of oil (like coconut oil) and boiling water let it set several hours to over night to release the dye.  VERY IMPORTANT, do not mix in any metal bowl or metal spoon use glass or plastic and make sure to cover it.  I know some people mix lemon juice or apple cider but that doesn&#x27;t work for me because again I&#x27;m trying to stay away from red tones.  After henna is ready apply to your hair and leave for about 3 hours uncovered.  Wrap it in plastic if you want red in your hair, then rinse DO NOT shampoo then blow dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now mix indigo with boiling water, no need to let it sit or add anything else.  Apply to your hair leave it uncovered for an 90 minutes then rinse and apply your favorite conditioner.  Blow dry your hair, the heat will bring out the true dark tones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember everyone&#x27;s hair is different- this works for me!</li>
    <li> My wife uses this all the time and it really helps with her natural hair.</li>
    <li> After my wife purchased this product for the first time, she is buying only this product/brand every time.  She loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its funny, how the manufacturer misspelled the product name.  It should be Henna Natural. But, hey, you get a kick out of this name.  Now we all don&#x27;t forget.</li>
    <li> The indigo powder makes a nice paste that nourishes my hair so I do not have to cut it as often.  When used after henna it darkens the hair too.  It also makes a nice color for skin art.</li>
    <li> it did not change my hair color at all. i have dark brown hair, but i was hoping for a navy blue without having to bleach my hair. when i mixed it according to the directions, it clumped up on the comb. i kept having to add more water to counteract the clumping. i had great difficulty even getting it onto my hair. i kept it on for far longer than it said to, but it made no difference. hoping to use what&#x27;s left to make ink, if i can figure out how.</li>
    <li> It works like its suppose to. Followed the youtube directions.  Make sure you use enough... There are two applications in the box. For medium length hair, use both packs..</li>
    <li> my hair is normally  medium brown</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure this worked because I did half henna half indigo and my hair still came out red. I was looking for brown.</li>
    <li> I wasted my money with this so called indigo powder. I tried it in many ways and nothing. there is no way to get my hair black. not worth it.</li>
    <li> This is a very good indigo. However, after years of mud in my hair I finally returned for the bottle hair dye!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product to &amp;#34;calm down&amp;#34; the bright red tones that henna left on the gray hair along my hairline.  I have long locs and the product worked wonderfully and rinsed out completely.  I left it in for three hours.  I am pleased with the quality and the helpful instructions on the packaging, not to mention the gloves and plastic cap that came with the indigo.  I only used 50g because I wanted to color the roots.  Users should be aware that indigo will fade over time, but with each successive dye the color becomes richer.  It is messy, but gives good results.</li>
    <li> It worked very well, I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Love the powder. Simple and easy instructions to follow the recipe. It comes with a pair of gloves and wood stick to mix. It comes with 2 packs of powder at 50 grams each. It did its job on my Natural African American Hair (3c, 4a, 4b curl pattern). It attached to the henna great and condition my hair well. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This alone won&#x27;t keep make your hair black or stay dark for very long.  It does temporarily stain, but a week of hair washing will rinse most of it out.  This needs a two step process to get that raven black look and for it to have more staying power.  That&#x27;s why I only gave it three stars.  You have to buy henna to get that luscious black colored hair.  I&#x27;ve included my method below for using both since I use the same company&#x27;s henna powder product as well.  So forgive me if the instructions sound a little weird since it&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve put for the henna as well.  [[ASIN:B009YSTOAG Hannah Natural 100% Pure Henna Powder, 100 Gram]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re going to want to buy Indigo powder, but if you want black you&#x27;re still going to need hena. I&#x27;ve used Hannah Natural 100% Pure Indigo Powder for Hair Dye. If you want brown you can mix up your henna, let it cure, then add the indigo powder to it before applying it to your hair. If you want a raven black color, and it made mine really black almost blue black, it&#x27;s a two step process. First you do the henna and after that&#x27;s washed out you mix up your indigo and apply it for at least 8 hours. I&#x27;ll add instructions to the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1 the Henna&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------After mixing the henna ( I like to use warm mint and ginger tea ( or ginger powder) and cinnamon powder with squirt of lemon and a table spoon of honey so that it smells nicer) I let it sit and &#x27;cure&#x27; over night to have the strongest color possible. Sometimes people find henna&#x27;s earthy scent to be kinda smelly like hay and possibly weed. Which is why I use my tea solution. After you apply the henna mix , which should have the thickened consistency of greek yogurt, let it sit for no less than four hours. If you want a stronger red color I recommend at least 12 hours or over night. You can use a shower cap or wrap it with plastic wrap to hold it in your hair and to prevent dripping on yourself and clothes. If you&#x27;re going to sleep with it on, maybe wrap a scarf over that and sleep on a towel. The longer you leave it on the more vibrant the hue, however having naturally black/brown hair myself the you may not get the color like on the box. It won&#x27;t be as red as if you used chemicals to bleach and dye your hair. It is however going to give it more of a red glaze to your hair. It will look very red in the sunlight and bring out your natural copper highlights. It&#x27;s really beautiful looking and natural. The henna is also much more gentle on your hair than chemicals. When you rinse it out, use warm water and conditioner only. Do not use shampoo on your hair the first few days. Some people mix coconut/milk/butter/oil with their henna before they apply it, but I suggest using it after to soften your hair. Henna dries it out a little bit. Your hair will definitely feel healthier and thicker though. I love using henna. Since you&#x27;re applying indigo immediately after skip using anything but warm water to get the henna out. Make sure you rinse it ALL OUT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STEP 2 the indigo-----------&lt;br /&gt;Indigo, unlike henna, must be used right away. Letting it sit to \\&quot;cure\\&quot; won&#x27;t do anything but make the product less efficient. Make sure to buy pure indigo powder for hair. None of that suspicious body art stuff. You don&#x27;t want the crap that comes with twigs and branches. All powder only. You can mix it up with tea again b/c it smells like boiled peas. I would add a pinch of salt to help the color out. Mix it up just before you&#x27;re rinsing all the henna out. Again to a thick, greek yogurt consistency. Make sure ALL of the henna is rinsed out and if you need use only minimal amounts of shampoo or conditioner, but try not to use conditioner at all. Once it&#x27;s fully rinsed you can towel dry your hair to so it&#x27;s not dripping wet. Apply your indigo as carefully as you did the henna. Indigo also stains but has a more blue/green stain than the henna. Like the henna you , the longer you leave it on, the stronger the color. If you want black leave iton at least 8 hours or over night. Once the time has passed you can first rinse it gently with luke warm water and then wash it out with conditioner. You&#x27;re not going to want to shampoo your hair every day. Every other day is more than fine. In fact only use conditioner to clean your hair. Indigo also has a drying affect on hair.&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;extra tips : Make sure you do this in the bathroom or other tiled room. Don&#x27;t wear clothes you like. You will drip and it will stain. Have towel around your shoulders during application. I&#x27;ve even gone as far as wearing a poncho to protect my clothes. Once you apply it, I use my hands, which are protected with gloves, you can use a shower cap or saran wrap (cling wrap/ grocery bags will do in a pinch if they&#x27;re plastic) to encase your head. It&#x27;s gonna feel hot,but that&#x27;s okay. Make sure to wrap everything up nice and tight. If you&#x27;re going to to wear it to sleep, you can wrap it up with scarves or bandanas. Cover your pillow and side of the bed with towels for during the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my experience this two step process has yielded very black results that I love. For a more brown look you can add the indigo powder to your henna mix right before application. « Show Lesson at least 8 hours or over night.

    <li> I have naturally mousy brown hair, and used to get a level 5 permanent color in the salon to darken it and make it look richer. Since I&#x27;m trying to detox, I figured I&#x27;d give henna a shot. First I checked out hennaforhair.com/mixes/ and chose a &amp;#34;recipe&amp;#34; using a one step process for &amp;#34;easy brunette&amp;#34; hair, consisting of henna, indigo, and alma. I bought this because it was 100% pure. The mix smelled like canned spinach and was the texture of mud; luckily I was prepared for that because I researched the process well in advance. Put it in my hair, wrapped it, wore it around the house for 5 hours, and the color was great. A dark chocolate brown with subtle red undertones. Grays a sparkly red highlight.&lt;br /&gt;Pro-tip: Do NOT shampoo this out. Rinse really well, then use a conditioner to wet comb, and rinse really well again. Henna cleans your scalp. It smells awful when wet for a good week after (ugh), but smells like sweet freshly cut grass when dry (yay). I use ACV rinse, so I don&#x27;t know if regular shampoo/conditioner will mask that.</li>
    <li> Out of different brands ,( even used mountain light was a disaster ), this one covered my grey hair, I didn&#x27;t use henna as stated on the box.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worth the patience of properly applying the product..it is a bit messy to use.</li>
    <li> This produced darkened my gray hairs but they were golden colored and bronze colored. You must use henna and not just indigo to get your hair dark.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t dye hair. Maybe the application was wrong.</li>
    <li> I just west my time &amp; money on this product their is no results at all</li>
    <li> Beautiful color awesome product</li>
    <li> I love this Indigo!! I have tried many other brands and this one gets my hair jet black. I add abt 1- 1 1/2 tsp of salt to my mix and let it sit about 10 mins and then apply. From now on this will be the only brand I use</li>
    <li> Not indigo. Ingredients say &amp;#34;100% pure indigo leaf powder (100%Indigoferra Tinctora), but it isn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve worked with indigo powder for years, and this is henna.  It smells like henna, it looks like henna (it is a greenish brown color). Indigo is a dark blue color, and doesn&#x27;t smell like henna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I wanted indigo, and not henna, this is a problem. I am wondering if perhaps it was mispackaged.</li>
    <li> Good product although I don&#x27;t know how much to mix with Hana to get a brown color, I think half half should be good. Anyway, I mixed with pure Hana, and color my hair, they are good enough.</li>
    <li> Perfect! It covered the red from the henna application.</li>
    <li> Nice, finely sifted indigo.  I LOVE the 50 gram packages so I can mix it 50/50 with the henna to make a beautiful chocolate brown hair with red highlights in the sun.  Beautiful, soft shiny hair.  Just as nice as the more expensive indigo from other websites.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it over a year now to color my grays. I do leave it on 3-4 hours though. Works great!!  Full coverage.</li>
    <li> Great color, great price!</li>
    <li> no reactions on sensitive scalp</li>
    <li> THIS DID NOT PERFORM LIKE REAL INDIGO.  WHILE IT CONDITIONED ADEQUATELY IT PROVIDED ZERO COLOR.  THE RESULT WAS THE SAME USED ALONE OR WITH HENNA.  MIXED IN THE SAME MANNER USED FOR YEARS, THE COLOR FAILED TO DEVELOP THREE SEPARATE TIMES.</li>
    <li> The powder works very well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my friend who bleached her hair (dirty yellow blond was a result) and wanted to give a funky purple haze to it. We mixed one of the packets form this box with some hot water (she has a short bob, chin length). As soon as the mix was cool enough to apply I smeared it onto her hair. We watched a movie and then washed it off (so ~1.5 total time on the hair) -- the color came out very interesting and pleasing. It is multidimensional blue-purple. She was very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have one packet (half of the box) left, so we&#x27;ll re-boost her color once it fades, probably in a month or so, because she said that color was washing off some with each shampoo.</li>
    <li> I severely damaged my scalp in my teens with way too much high volume peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;Even shampoo would cause it to blister. Shea Moisture and Wen hair care are all I use now for cleansing and conditioning. So obviously hair dye is out of the question.&lt;br /&gt;Thank GOD for henna and indigo.&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it heal damaged hair and scalp, it looks and feels amazing! My hair is fuller and so shiny!&lt;br /&gt;For black hair, it must be done over henna. For brown, you can mix together. I am going for black because that is more or less my natural hair color.&lt;br /&gt;This blends the random gray away! I will definitely rock my gray once it has a more distinct pattern, but for now this is such a healthy and inexpensive &#x27;luxury&#x27;. It is my monthly &#x27;hair mask&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;This kit has a plastic cap and gloves. I don&#x27;t care for the gloves, but the cap is great.&lt;br /&gt;Heat DOES help it to set quickly, as the package directions suggest.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy and fun, so go for it!</li>
    <li> This is a great natural product. I initially used it with henna dye and then the week after used this alone and had a huge difference in color. I left it on for about 3 hours. Great product if you are trying to get away from harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> It did what I expected it to do, that is, to tone down the colour of the henna powder on my greys. I was hoping for a darker shade but what I now have is a lighter brown which is ok. I am suggesting that more complete instructions be placed on the box since this product requires the henna powder to work.</li>
    <li> I used this after hennaing my hair and it made my hair a pretty, dark brown/auburn color. My natural color is dirty blonde. I would definitely get this again.</li>
    <li> great for mixing with henna to achieve dark brown color hair, color last about 5 weeks for me, highly recommend it as a substitute for regular coloring, conditioning hair... Just know that your hair will smell like hay for a few days after use.</li>
    <li> I used one packet of this with one packet of the Henna (same company) and my hair came out a lovely dark brown/red color.</li>
    <li> Sometimes not work well.</li>
    <li> It did not cover the gray hair that much.  I was not happy the result of gray hair.</li>
    <li> Works very well. No chemicals. Perfect way to dye your hair black after applying henna. Good quality powder that is fresh</li>
    <li> I bought this to mix with my henna to give me a dark auburn color.  I use about 60% henna to 40% indigo.  I think this product works very well and is long lasting.  I have never used this for strictly black color, so I cannot comment on how well it works in that respect.  I will buy this product again in the future as I have been very happy with my coloring results.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t seem to alter the hairs color, especially grey hairs. ON A POSATIVE NOTE IT STINKS SO BAD IT MAKES AMAZING FLY TRAP BAIT! seriously, the flys adore this stuff.</li>
    <li> Covers the gray with first using henna. Will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to use that product after reviewing all the comments for this product but I&#x27;m totally disappointed after using it. Even i used the henna before the Hannah Natural pure indigo didn&#x27;t work as it was suppose to be. NO silky ,No dark black,there is nothing in it.I waited for almost 3 hrs and what happend all blue color just washed down.It was the worst product I ever used.I&#x27;m never going to buy again .If ANY OTHER CUSTOMER HAVE ANY GOOD OPINION OR ADVICE PLEASE LET ME KNOW.I will definitely want to return it.</li>
    <li> I Followed all the instructions and even researched how to use this product online. After mixing it with hot water and leaving it alone for more than the required time of fifteen minutes it remained green and did not change color.  After leaving the product on for more than one hour it did not cover any redness left from using henna and did not make my hair black.</li>
    <li> I use this indigo after my 2-hour henna treatment so I can color my hair dark brown. It works beautifully. Excellent color, and easy to apply. I leave it on 45 minutes and use conditioner to help rinse it out. Very happy!</li>
    <li> The end color was pretty although it does wear-off in about 2 weeks like the instructions say.&lt;br /&gt;And while I totally enjoy natural without chemicals the fact that I would have to do this application every two weeks to maintain the color with the outrageous amount of mess you have to endure with this...is the reason it has only 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using henna and indigo to dye my naturally black hair since I became allergic to chemical dye a few years ago. I&#x27;ve tried different indigo powder but this is the best I&#x27;ve ever used! It&#x27;s very smooth and easy to mix. It dyes my hair nicely. I have no complaints about the product... However, I am very disappointed that this became an add on item. I was able to get this shipped quickly when I ordered it last time before it became an add on item. Now I need to order a bulk of items in order to get this one and it says it will ship in 4 to 6 weeks??? I guess I can order some for the future but I really wanted to get this right now and it looks like I have to look elsewhere to get what I need.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a product to dye my hair but I am a Henna-head! With that being said, the Henna has turned my hair a nice, reddish color which I don&#x27;t really mind at all. If you are a natural, then you know the darker your hair is sometimes the fuller it will look. So I decided to give this a try since you use it with Henna. I followed the directions on the package to the letter and when I finally finished hours later, my hair was only a half a shade darker! Talk about disappointed. I may or may not give it one more go but for the hours you invest in this process, I would like to see better results.</li>
    <li> I use this plus the hannah natural henna and it really works to cover my dads grays! Looks much more natural than the black dye! Best part of it all is its NATURAL!</li>
    <li> This is unbelievably inexpensive and does the job.  I used other brands and sat with the indigo in my hair for hours.  With this brand I leave it in for 30 minutes and it does the job.  I have become a repeat buyer of this brand.</li>
    <li> An odiferous and messy, messy experience</li>
    <li> I have used this indigo 3x now (after henna for a black color). The second time I forgot to add lemon juice and salt. The color didn&#x27;t keep, it just kept washing out every time I showered. The 3rd time is when I re-did it. I used 300 g (3 boxes) to cover my medium length hair. I mixed with filtered water, juice from one lemon and about a teaspoon of salt. The color has kept well. Using this on top of henna I am able to get the color on the box. My hair is naturally white.</li>
    <li> Great product! Worked just like advertised. Completely herbal and natural solution. I would buy this again and recommend to others as well.</li>
    <li> Used it with henna to dye hair jet black and it worked perfectly!</li>
    <li> Good product! Worked as expected.</li>
    <li> Seemed to work as well as the brand I&#x27;ve been buying from Henna for Hair for a long time. I was happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! I bought the henna light brown and I liked the color but it turned more red than what I wanted. So I bought this to darken it and wow the results are amazing. It really covers the gray and Its a very dark color. Its great for touch up for grays. I would buy again.. thanks.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Hannah Natural 100% pure Henna &amp; the Hannah Natural 100% Indigo.  I love the easy to measure 100 grams packed in 2 individual 50 gram packs per box.  That way I can use a one step Henna/ Indigo process instead of the 2 step method of using the Henna first and the Indigo second.  I love the quality of both the Henna and Indigo and will be buying more in the future.</li>
    <li> This indigo did exactly what it was supposed to. Good packing and great quality. I will buy again this product.</li>
    <li> When mixed with henna I get beautiful, shiny color.</li>
    <li> Works but it tends to fade quicker than other brands I&#x27;ve used. I use it with the henna and do the two step process for black hair. I use their henna as well. It seems to hold well. As the black fades, a reddish color comes through.</li>
    <li> Excellent!! Don&#x27;t ever discontinue it!!</li>
    <li> I have one year using this product and I love it, I use this with henna in one step, my hair finish dark brown.</li>
    <li> I mix this with my henna (about 50//50) to get a color closer to my natural brown.  It&#x27;s important to mix it with the henna (make the henna, make the indigo, then mix) rather than applying it after the henna, otherwise you&#x27;ll end up with jet black hair. Good product. No complaints.</li>
    <li> This product did not cover my grey - disappointed</li>
    <li> I used the straight henna three times now and it made my hair too carrot red, so I started mixing it with this and here is what I found. My hair is somewhat long, to the end of my shoulder blades. And, it is naturally a medium brown, but now about 30% gray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This box comes with 2 bags of indigo, as does the henna of the same brand. When I used one bag it wasn&#x27;t enough to fully cover my head. And, with just the henna it came out carrot top read - too bright for even slightly crazy me. :) If you like very red, this is awesome! But beware, the grays come out VERY read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I did some research. Now, I&#x27;ve made my hair PERFECT!! It is a medium to dark brown with beautiful red highlights. I love it! And it is super healthy. Even my hair dresser sister loved it and said how natural and healthy it looked. Here is the formula I put together after research:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 bag of this henna (same brand as this stuff - it&#x27;s orange/red dye)&lt;br /&gt;1 bag of indigo&lt;br /&gt;1 tablespoon of Amla (it&#x27;s a natural power conditioner you can get on Amazon cheap and helps reduce red)&lt;br /&gt;dash of salt (I read this releases the dye)&lt;br /&gt;mix these dry ingredients together&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add about 1 1/2 cups of hot water and stir (to the consistency of pancake or cake batter)&lt;br /&gt;Add 1 tablespoon lemon (releases dye also, I read)&lt;br /&gt;Add 1 tablespoon olive oil (this is VERY important - it is SO much easier to spread on hair and rinse out with this addition)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mix all these and let it sit 30 minutes. Then, put it on your hair, as you would any other dye. Seperating sections and really saturating it. Cover with a shower cap. Then, let it sit for 1.5 hours or more - I did 1.5 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinse. Shampoo. Condition. Maybe shampoo a second time - I find that residue stains my shirt after first two shampoos, so doing it twice helps. This residue goes away after a couple shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above recipe worked amazingly for me. Love, love, love it. Some people complain about the smell, but my entire family, including my 7 year old son, like it fine - we think it smells like strong tea. Of course, everyone&#x27;s hair is different, but the above worked great for me. Good luck!ain about the smell, but my entire family, including my 7 year old son, like it fine - we think it smells like strong tea. Of course, everyone&#x27;s hair is different, but the above worked great for me. Good luck!</li>
    <li> Great product, color saturates into the hair very well.  I will definitely continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> Best natural hair color</li>
    <li> Rated it according to hearsay. Will give it to my grandson on his birthday -- still a ways off.</li>
    <li> I have never bought this stuff before, so I was a bit hesitant, but I mixed it up and slapped it on. I had/have mostly grey hair of varying shades,so I figured I would try this out to highlight it. It worked great.The color was more of a steel blue, but it did as promised, and it tells you that if you want it as a highlight, you should do a dark color first, then put this on.&lt;br /&gt;All in all I was pleased.My hair smelled like......well it smelled like marijuana, actually, so I had a laugh, everyone wanted to sniff my hair! The smell didnt last that long though, it was gone in about a week or less. But my hair was soft and silky, and had a nice shine.&lt;br /&gt;I did break down and buy a dark hair color, and re-dyed my hair, so I will use the second package as a highlight/treatment over that so my hair will have a blue tint out in the sun.</li>
    <li> I will try it myself this time.  Only heard friends using it and gave it good remark.</li>
    <li> This product really does work. I tried another brand and followed the directions and it hardly colored my hair at all and after one wash it was out. But this brand after using henna has my hair jet black the way I wanted it to be. It is also a lot cheaper.</li>
