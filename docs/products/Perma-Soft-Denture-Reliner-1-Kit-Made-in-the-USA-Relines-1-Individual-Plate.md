      <li>I was able to make the repairs on my teethe that I needed.</li>
      <li>I let it set for more like 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
      <li>and now I am glad I did.  </li>
      <li>Have used this product 3 times in 5 years and it has always performed better than advertised for me.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product and works fast.</li>
      <li>Just wish there was more to the product.</li>
      <li>Comfortable!</li>
      <li>The reason that I did not give it 5 stars is that while the lower denture had more than needed.</li>
      <li>I have bought this product on several occasions and it is the best that I have found.  </li>
      <li>it does work exactally as the instructions state so be prepared and read instructions first!!!</li>
      <li>The good news is that if you soak the finished dentures in a mix of baking soda and water, most of that taste is gone very soon.</li>
      <li>The professional job is superior (better fit and taste goes away faster),  but the cost difference is astounding...</li>
      <li>I get a better fit.  </li>
      <li>My Amazon.com purchase of Prosoft Professional Denture Reliner worked great for my purposes.</li>
      <li>I did it myself with perma soft it worked great</li>
      <li>And if your experience is like mine was, they&#x27;ll also fit a lot better doing it yourself.</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t need adhesive anymore - the dentures fit better then they ever have.</li>
      <li>They even fit better than when the dentist did their reline on them.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use and seems to be durable.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s affordable and the instructions are easy to follow....</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>Easy application too.....</li>
      <li>Easy to use, i will buy again if needed.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Great easy peoduct to work with</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s easy to fix those imperfections yourself using this</li>
      <li>great fitting re-line yourself, at a tiny fraction of what you&#x27;d pay the dentist.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Using the product is as easy as can be.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s really easy to use.</li>
      <li>Odor was tad strong for bout 2 weeks but that went away.</li>
      <li>Went on easily and works just fine.</li>
      <li>Most of what is not painful to eat is carbs.</li>
      <li>Worked fine for me....</li>
      <li>and you will be fine.  </li>
      <li>Since I relined these I wear them during the day as they fit so well (with no product to make them stick)and the \\&quot;good\\&quot; ones for nightime wear.</li>
      <li>Having said that.....it&#x27;s just as good as a professional job.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m left with a good well fitting reline</li>
      <li>This has really put my health in jeopardy because I have borderline diabetes and not being able to eat healthy foods</li>
      <li>I find that I get a better fit for my lower denture if I hold it in place with my fingers those first three minutes.  </li>
      <li>Delivery and price were exceptional and I would suggest this to anyone who dosent want to pay a professional.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s original shape and texture for over 40 days.  </li>
      <li>After 17 years, my dentures finally fit well and are not painful.  </li>
      <li>The trick is getting the perfect fit, which means not moving a muscle during those first three minutes, (if you follow the directions, and bite down)....</li>
      <li>I noticed no bad taste at all.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t often write reviews, but this product, true to other reviews is great.  </li>
      <li>Most important thing is that you NEVER use hot water to rinse your denture until you&#x27;re ready to use another alignment kit or it will separate from the denture.</li>
      <li>but if you soak the relined product in a mixture of baking soda and water overnight it subsides quickly.</li>
      <li>The chemical taste goes away quickly and is not an issue for me</li>
      <li>Id give this 5 stars but for the taste, tho it does go away quickly.  </li>
      <li>Best personal care purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
      <li>Helps very very loose dentures fit much better!</li>
      <li>I bought this product hoping that it would make my upper plate fit better.</li>
      <li>I removed it and ordered a different kind.</li>
      <li>(WELL worth it).</li>
      <li>This product is by far better than what is sold in stores and is comparable to the soft-liner used in the dentist office.</li>
      <li>worth every penny in my opinion</li>
      <li>Well worth the results.</li>
      <li>Yes, the aftertaste is unpleasant for a short while, but the end result will make you happy happy!!!</li>
      <li>Actually, I cant tell much of a difference, they both are easy to use and help you create a comfortable fit.</li>
      <li>When I had my dentures made 15 years ago, the dentist didn&#x27;t line them right away.  </li>
      <li>Brushing the teeth with nonabrasive toothpaste and rinsing the liner quickly with an antibacterial oral rinse and clear water works just fine.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great to have this product available to the public since dental visits are extremely costly.  </li>
      <li>Follow instructions and the old liner is easy to remove.</li>
      <li>(and it has been my experience that no other person.. especially a dentist that does not wear dentures.. or even if he does.. or has had the best training... can possibly know what works for me).  </li>
      <li>This is a good product for other people but it did not work very well for me</li>
      <li>This stff is great, hard to find anymore</li>
      <li>My upper denture requires more than supplied.</li>
      <li>If your upper denture reline requires a lot as mine does it will be ok.</li>
      <li>Great, it lasts for at least two years.&lt;br /&gt;There is an update for this product</li>
      <li>I did exactly what the directions in the package said and lo and behold</li>
      <li>Four stars for you, Perma Soft!!!!  </li>
      <li>I have used this fine product a few times with satisfying results.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My dentist wanted $ 400 to re line my denture I did it myself with perma soft it worked great I do not have any plastic taste from  it .My only complaint is that I had a burning sensation for about a minute while the it was setting up in my mouth ....that is my only complaint</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Be sure to remove previous liner first.  Holds very well.</li>
    <li> I ordered the wrong denture reliner.Its to hard to use for my mother,who found out it was to hard to understand how to use &amp; took to long.</li>
    <li> Product is as described. Easy to use and seems to be durable. However, it does  have an unpleasant odor and a bitter taste that does not go away.</li>
    <li> The product was extremely user-friendly - however, the aftertaste did not dissipate and lingered on for several weeks.  Even after a month, the taste reappears slightly but less intense.  The product seems to last for about six (6) weeks and then needs replacing again.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply! Last! Comfortable! Helps very very loose dentures fit much better! I would recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> I was devastated when Dentrite by Seabond was taken off the market.  It had totally saved me from a terrible problem with ill fitting dentures and pastes and gloop. I read all of the reviews and selected this one because it said that it lasted longer.  That was a poor decision on my part. It does last longer and is very similar to what I had gotten from the dentist.  However, the very reason why I bought Dentrite even after seeing the dentist was not solved.  It did not give me that tight fit and suction that the softer Dentrite gave. It shrunk a bit when it hardened so that it slips and hurts and I get food under it, often painfully.  This has really put my health in jeopardy because I have borderline diabetes and not being able to eat healthy foods has really made my blood sugar bad.  Most of what is not painful to eat is carbs. So I am trying other products that say soft hoping to get the comfort that Dentrite had given me.  Although it is true that Dentrite didn&#x27;t last long it solved a problem for me that even the chair reline at the dentist didn&#x27;t because it was softer.    In addition the smell was WAY WAY worse than Dentrite and lasted for days.  The other one I am trying also has reviews mentioning odor however. I am hoping that it isn&#x27;t as bad as this was, but more than that I am hoping that that doesn&#x27;t mean that it is hard like this one is. It is a new product so not many reviews. If I do find one similar I will let you know.    I should mention also that I am suspicious that this didn&#x27;t come with any packaging. Just two vials and plastic cups of powder in an envelope and typed directions. No package with the name of the product or anything like that.    This product if for you if you like the reline at the dentists. However, if you are looking for the softer Dentrite reline this is not it.</li>
    <li> I usually use the permasoft brand but thought Id try the prosoft.  Actually, I cant tell much of a difference, they both are easy to use and help you create a comfortable fit. Tho prosoft seems to set up faster in the mixing cup a tad bit faster than permasoft it seems. Im not in a position to run to the dentist when I want, so being able to do a reline is extremely helpful.  I think the longest the reline lasted me was about 8 months before feeling like I needed to do another.  With the reline kit I no longer needed any gluey adhesives at all.  Just read the directions, follow them step by step as described and you can have a good fit.  A few times Ive had to use a nail file to smooth a place down, and again, a few times I was in a rush and didnt do it right and had to start all over.  My fault.  Dont get distracted when doing this--it doesnt take much time at all.      Yes, there is an odor and an aftertaste, but for me it seems to go away after about 24 hrs.  I think there is a trick to the relining thing too as to time of day.  I find I consistently get a better fit if I do the reline late afternoon or early eveing.  I find my dentures are a bit snug in the am and a bit loose in the pm, so if I do a reline in the pm I get a better fit.  For me, anyway.  Then after soaking the denture overnight, there is very little problem with odor or aftertaste in the am.    Id give this 5 stars but for the taste, tho it does go away quickly.  All in all, this is a good product and I will buy more and stock up a few to keep some on hand.</li>
    <li> I should have found this long ago. Went on easily and works just fine.</li>
    <li> This product was the worst I have ever tried for my dentures. It was a pain to mix, the texture came out very rough and iritating to my gums, and there was an extremely bitter chemical taste that leached out continuously for over a week which made me quite ill. Needless to say I was forced to remove the liners and am now in search of a better product. Definately not worth the price or the misery.</li>
    <li> It has helped my husbands problem.  It also saved a lot of money</li>
    <li> works well, good for about a month of hoding all three peices of my bottom dentures together</li>
    <li> I purchased the Prosoft Professional Denture Reliner kit for mother on November 12,2011.  It is a fantastik product which  held it&#x27;s original shape and texture for over 40 days.  It&#x27;s best not to soak the denture in a cleaning solution over night in order to help prolong the reliner consistency. Brushing the teeth with nonabrasive toothpaste and rinsing the liner quickly with an antibacterial oral rinse and clear water works just fine. It&#x27;s great to have this product available to the public since dental visits are extremely costly.  The \\&quot;Prosoft Professional Denture Reliner\\&quot; is not commercial grade but I would certainly recommend it to others who wear dentures.</li>
    <li> I have bought this product on several occasions and it is the best that I have found.  Will buy again</li>
    <li> My Amazon.com purchase of Prosoft Professional Denture Reliner worked great for my purposes. It was simple to use with nice clear instructions. It doesn&#x27;t work as an adhesive, just a cushion between my gums and the denture. So far it has been working for about a month without any problem. I thank you and my gums thank you.</li>
    <li> This worked very well for me,yes there is a bit of bad taste but looking at some reviews I expected much worse,that was not the case with me,I did make up a baking soda wash which was 1 tablespoon to 5oz water soke overnight,took most of the unwanted taste away</li>
    <li> Could fit s little tighter but very much better than it was.  I followed the directions very carefully. Not easy to do but definitely worth the effort. I would definitely use it again.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!!  After 17 years, my dentures finally fit well and are not painful.  I wish I had found this product years ago.  It was easy to use and the unpleasant taste only lasted for a few hours.  Well worth the results.</li>
    <li> Best product like this that I have tried,</li>
    <li> Nobody really wants to discuss their denture problems, but after 2 years of my dentist trying (but failing) to make my dentures fit, I was desperate to have them finally fit correctly so I could wear them, I&#x27;d like to share my experience with other denture wearers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you follow the instructions (to the letter), it&#x27;s much easier than it sounds to do a quality, great fitting re-line yourself, at a tiny fraction of what you&#x27;d pay the dentist. And if your experience is like mine was, they&#x27;ll also fit a lot better doing it yourself. The fact is that nobody knows what&#x27;s wrong with your dentures fit than yourself. Denture wearers know all it takes is a tiny imperfection where the dentures meet the gum, to make them hard to impossible to wear. And it&#x27;s easy to fix those imperfections yourself using this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for less than $50, and about an hour&#x27;s work, I am now able to wear my dentures all day long in comfort. Best personal care purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time. Hope this recommendation helps others to do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS, I would have given the product 5 stars, if not for the initial chemical taste after applying the product. The good news is that if you soak the finished dentures in a mix of baking soda and water, most of that taste is gone very soon.</li>
    <li> Works fine, but was disappointed as it seemed to become smelly?...even after brushing my plate it seem to have a smell?..yeah I know but I am very sensitive to having bad breath I hate it in other people and NO way do i want it ..at any time.</li>
    <li> Works well. Easy to use, i will buy again if needed. Odor was tad strong for bout 2 weeks but that went away.</li>
    <li> easy to use, quick,and last and lasts. The chemical taste goes away quickly and is not an issue for me</li>
    <li> This product was easier to use than some of the reviews told. I am much happier with Perma Soft than any other of the many&lt;br /&gt;denture products I have tried.</li>
    <li> This product works as good as it says it does, and I would recommend. It to anyone who has dentures.</li>
    <li> This product does not work at all. When mixing the liquid with powder, it is supposed to be like honey per instructions&lt;br /&gt;It was so thick I could not pour into dentures and never became any thinner. Don&#x27;t waste your money the cheap stuff in drug stores works better.</li>
    <li> Horrible Don&#x27;t waste your money The taste is nauseating Once you get that the stuff dries to this hard rough yuck.. with delivery charges and the product I&#x27;m at $22 for nothing... I did use it on the lower denture...</li>
    <li> It was nothing that it was advertised to be. It was no difference to some I bought at CVS for less than half the price. It does not adhere and is very thin. I followed the directions to the letter. My money was wasted.</li>
    <li> sure beats paying 300.00 for dentist to do just follw instructions and perfect and to help with smell put in warm salt water</li>
    <li> Follow instructions and the old liner is easy to remove. Using the product is as easy as can be. It worked great and looks just like the dentist did it for me. I noticed no bad taste at all. My dentist wants over $300 a pop to line. Ease of use and all the money I saved, I will be a customer for life.</li>
    <li> The reline works just as well as the dentist&#x27;s office.  No difference.  I had to take a star for the awful awful taste of the stuff for 2 days.  I kept rinsing with Listerine just to kill the taste.  Now day three, it&#x27;s gone and I&#x27;m left with a good well fitting reline</li>
    <li> Good product easy to use and it saved me 200.00 at the dentist office.  Just follow the directions and you will be fine.  I am going to reorder.</li>
    <li> The product itself if wonderful, and seems to get better after a month or two.  The trick is getting the perfect fit, which means not moving a muscle during those first three minutes, (if you follow the directions, and bite down).... I find that I get a better fit for my lower denture if I hold it in place with my fingers those first three minutes.  But my lower denture is way to big now that my gums have shrunk so much. Asking a soft liner to fill the gap is asking a lot, but for me, it has made the difference between being able to eat or not for the last two years,  Why pay a dentist two or three  hundred dollars to put a soft liner in when you can do it yourself for this price? (and it has been my experience that no other person.. especially a dentist that does not wear dentures.. or even if he does.. or has had the best training... can possibly know what works for me).  Sometimes it takes a few tries, but I always divide each application in half because even half is more than I need each time I use it.  Four stars for you, Perma Soft!!!!  I like your product better than anything out there. Thanks for being there.</li>
    <li> I gave this 5 stars because it is easy to use and is a big help keeping my dentures tight.  I still use an adhesive to keep them in tight, but this liner gives my mouth a soft base to lay against.  When I had my dentures made 15 years ago, the dentist didn&#x27;t line them right away.  Later, after my gums shrank, the dentist said that he no longer lines the dentures.  He said that I needed new ones.  Can&#x27;t afford that, so I bought and tried Perma Soft.  It has a little bit of a bad taste, but that goes away within a few days.</li>
    <li> Way over priced. I found the same brand at locale drug store for $1.98 a box. So don&#x27;t bother buying this from here.</li>
    <li> This product is by far better than what is sold in stores and is comparable to the soft-liner used in the dentist office. it does work exactally as the instructions state so be prepared and read instructions first!!! i will purchase again as it is a big cost savings over a trip to the Doc....NO SMELL&lt; NO TASTE!!! doesnt stink up your house!!!!!! worth every penny in my opinion so order 2 to keep 1 on hand if you can!</li>
    <li> Good product. The reason that I did not give it 5 stars is that while the lower denture had more than needed. My upper denture requires more than supplied. If your upper denture reline requires a lot as mine does it will be ok. It gives you enough time before hardening as long as you hurry.</li>
    <li> I bought this product hoping that it would make my upper plate fit better. I have had dentures for about 5 months now and have always had to use alot of denture adhesive to keep them in. I did exactly what the directions in the package said and lo and behold, I don&#x27;t need adhesive anymore - the dentures fit better then they ever have. I will be buying this product forever! Don&#x27;t let the bad reviews stop you from using this stuff, it works great!!!!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.easy to do if you follow directions.it does have a bad taste but I let mine sit in cold water a couple of days and now the taste is gone</li>
    <li> I give this product a 4 star rating. I have used other reliners and this mixes as well but is softer and easier to work with. I will rate it another star when I see how long it lasts and see how it feels when I actually eat something.  I have relined my own dentures for years and have saved a lot of money verses dentist costs. Occasionally I have to use a emery board after a while to file rough spots as the liner settles, will see how this does.</li>
    <li> For temporary use, I think it&#x27;s GREAT!!  Easy application too.....Hopefully, it will last a year or two...It&#x27;s affordable and the instructions are easy to follow....Worked fine for me....</li>
    <li> Alarmingly unprofessional packaging, but no matter, because instructions, ingredients, warnings, etc, were all there.  Easy to use. I made a mistake in not dividing the product in half because there was more than enough to reline lower denture twice. It tasted even nastier than the stuff my dentist uses, so try to put it in at night so it can go immediately into baking soda soak. Using denture adhesive cuts the nasty taste for as long as it adheres (which isn&#x27;t long). After I had used Perma Soft, I called my dentist to see how much money I had saved. I found out from my dentist&#x27;s receptionist that I could get free soft relines for length of my warrenty at Aspen which is not what the dentist had indicated, so I pried the Perma Soft out after 3 days, and, wow, was it stuck in there well, which is good.  I will use it again after my warrenty is up.  The professional job is superior (better fit and taste goes away faster),  but the cost difference is astounding... Aspen wanted $120.  Would recommend this product, even though I cannot attest to how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> Short of visiting a dentist -- an expensive visit if you&#x27;re on Social Security -- the Perma Soft product can give you relief, while relieving your wallet at the same time.</li>
    <li> this works really great ....downside is the awful taste that lingers for days and not enough product so no room for error.</li>
    <li> Loved the product.  I was able to make the repairs on my teethe that I needed. Just wish there was more to the product.</li>
    <li> Why pay my dentist&#x27;s bills when I&#x27;ve got my own? He charges hundreds for replacement liners, and the substance he uses is exactly the same as Perma Soft. This stuff works. Enough said.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this several times. Makes my dentures feel new again and fit snugly and perfect. Directions say to let the mixture sit for 30 seconds.... I let it set for more like 3 to 4 minutes. No strong smell or aftertaste. This reliner realistically lasts about 3 months (WELL worth it). The box says 2 years and that&#x27;s inaccurate.  I will GLADLY reline every 2  to 3 months to have perfect fitting dentures that barely need any adhesive to stay put.</li>
    <li> Have used this product 3 times in 5 years and it has always performed better than advertised for me.  Follow the directions and you&#x27;ll have no problems.  Yes, the aftertaste is unpleasant for a short while, but the end result will make you happy happy!!!</li>
    <li> This product was listed as &#x27;Soft&#x27;.  When mixed properly and applied to the denture plate, it hardened to a solid and did not remain soft as stated.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t often write reviews, but this product, true to other reviews is great.  I initially bought this to reline my \\&quot;temporary\\&quot; dentures that I wear at night, since I grind my teeth (I have my lower teeth) and upon waking my upper gums are raw and sore.  I followed instructions and also some of the insights and comments from other reviews and had no problem doing the reline.  Start to finish..30 minutes. Since I relined these I wear them during the day as they fit so well (with no product to make them stick)and the \\&quot;good\\&quot; ones for nightime wear. They even fit better than when the dentist did their reline on them.  Thanks PermaSoft you&#x27;ve got a customer for life.</li>
    <li> This stff is great, hard to find anymore</li>
    <li> I must have not waited long enough to apply as it did not adhere to my dentures. It also didnot adhere to my upper dentures which are made of metal.</li>
    <li> Have used it before. Very easy to apply if you follow instruction.&lt;br /&gt;Can stay almost two years if you did it correctly.</li>
    <li> Very good have used it before. Would recommend it.Very easy to use no mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;78 yrs old,used on lower denture.</li>
    <li> This is a good product for other people but it did not work very well for me I need something that lasts longer.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and works fast. Delivery and price were exceptional and I would suggest this to anyone who dosent want to pay a professional.</li>
    <li> I have used this fine product a few times with satisfying results.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work.  Wouldn&#x27;t matter as the taste is enough to gag a maggot.</li>
    <li> Great, it lasts for at least two years.&lt;br /&gt;There is an update for this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Perma Soft for several years to reline both my upper plate and my lower partial. It takes about an hour of your time but it&#x27;s really easy to use. Only thing is that there&#x27;s a residual taste once you&#x27;ve used it but if you soak the relined product in a mixture of baking soda and water overnight it subsides quickly. Most important thing is that you NEVER use hot water to rinse your denture until you&#x27;re ready to use another alignment kit or it will separate from the denture. Obviously a professional reline doesn&#x27;t have the taste but it&#x27;s a lot more expensive and sometimes you have to leave it to get it done; plus it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than a professional reline. Having said that.....it&#x27;s just as good as a professional job.</li>
    <li> This reliner is great.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with perma soft holding my denture in place.  It is easy to use and last a long time is why I wanted to try it and now I am glad I did.  It&#x27;s nice not haveing to worry about applying denture adhesive everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much</li>
    <li> I think I probably was expecting too much. After a couple of weeks it discolored and got very hard. I removed it and ordered a different kind.</li>
    <li> Perma Soft Denture Reliner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great easy peoduct to work with&lt;br /&gt;excelent results, very good price, I will not hesitate to recomend it.</li>
