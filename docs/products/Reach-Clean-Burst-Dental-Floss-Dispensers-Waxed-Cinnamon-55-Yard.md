<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This order was the first time ordering this floss and it was the same floss I had used for years so I ordered another pack.</li>
    <li> For some reason the area big discount stores stopped carrying Dentotape - hence getting it from Amazon.  I don&#x27;t like regular floss because it shreds too easily, and I personally think Dentotape does a more through job of getting between teeth.  The Dentist always compliments me on my teeth and I think flossing with this is one reason.</li>
    <li> Great product Thanks!</li>
    <li> Got those because they were cheap. They may work if you have large gaps in between your teeth, otherwise they do not glide and they wont get in between teeth. Was total waste of money. I never had such bad floss. Better to bye some nylon thread from Lowe&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Denotape is hard to find locally. I ordered on line and received exactly what I was looking for. Works better than floss for me.</li>
    <li> Great product.....the thicker Dento Tape is most effective in the Flossing process for me.</li>
    <li> As described and delivered on time</li>
    <li> The only &#x27;floss&#x27; we buy. Quality dental tape that is thick enough to clean between teeth without feeling like it is cutting the delicate gum line.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Works well.  Thick enough to get the job done effectively, sturdy enough that it does not break while you floss.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> good price. Use daily.</li>
    <li> Use this product all the time.</li>
    <li> It works great for me.</li>
    <li> Excellent product Excellent value Excellent delivery time!!!</li>
    <li> Best dental tape on the market.</li>
    <li> This keeps plaque from building up on teeth in between dental cleanings.  My teeth used to get \\&quot;wider\\&quot; with lots of build up that thinner floss just didn&#x27;t remove.  My dental hygienist and dentist have been amazed at how much better condition my teeth and gums are at check ups.</li>
    <li> I have used and recommended Johnson and Johnson Dental Tape for the past twenty years because of the great results I have found in my patients dental health as well as my own.  This tape cleans between the teeth more effectively and reaches under the gum tissue more comfortably. There is a certain technique which your hygienist can teach you and once you&#x27;ve used this tape, nothing else will clean as well!</li>
    <li> Thankfully J&amp;J still makes this product.  It does what it says and gets the job done.  It is reasonably priced, as well.</li>
    <li> Reach makes another dentotape that&#x27;s even wider. I thought that this might be as wide. This is closer to the width of traditional tape. That said, this is well packaged, shipped fast, and is a very good deal.</li>
    <li> Hard to fine the dentotape. I like it better than the floss and the price was good.</li>
    <li> this item was just what I ordered GREAT.</li>
    <li> I was misled by the title &amp;#34;extra wide&amp;#34; and one review. My teeth are tight and I shouldn&#x27;t have ordered the extra thick floss. I should read the picture carefully then I would notice the &amp;#34;extra thick&amp;#34; word on the package. It is a quality product, but just doesn&#x27;t fit me.</li>
    <li> Each person&#x27;s choice for dental floss is different. Even my wife uses one completely different from mine(this one). If you like a heavy duty thicker waxed floss then this one is for you. I hate those skinny little ones that fail to remove anything from between my teeth. I used to buy this one in Wally World but they no longer stock it. It has gotten to be hard to find. So, I ordered 6 of them through Amazon.com instead.</li>
    <li> We use this all the time in our family</li>
    <li> The only floss which does not break or fray. Good for tight conditions. No longer available at my grocery store.</li>
    <li> they are good  but shipping is slow.</li>
    <li> I was reasonably pleased with this product. Much better than standard dental tape.</li>
    <li> I have been using the extra wide dentofloss for so long that the spelling is no longer in spell check. It is no longer available publically. I was very happy to find the Reach Extra Wide on Amazon that i bought a load of the packages so, as long as I have teeth, I will have dentofloss.</li>
    <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;*Great if you have wide-spaced teeth&lt;br /&gt;*Thicker, so gives you a more thorough clean between your teeth&lt;br /&gt;*Extra thickness makes it less likely to hurt/cut your gums&lt;br /&gt;*We have had trouble finding this in stores recently, so it is nice to still be able to purchase it&lt;br /&gt;*This is a very large supply of floss that will last a very long time&lt;br /&gt;*Reasonable price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;*These larger containers do not have a lid to cover the end of the floss where it comes out of the container, which doesn&#x27;t seem very sanitary&lt;br /&gt;*If your teeth are close together or if you have fillings between your teeth, this floss tends to be difficult to use and often frays</li>
    <li> Our dental office used to have a nice wide dentotape that we can no longer get. We have tried many others since but none have been as wide as the original. Guess this is the best we are gonna get.</li>
    <li> Much  stronger than regular dental floss or Glide. If your teeth are really tight this might not work for you. I have some that are more snug than others &amp; I really have to work to get it between them.</li>
    <li> I have found that I do a much better job cleaning my teeth with dental tape then dental floss.  Reach Dentotape works good.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite floss. Does a great job with your dental hygiene</li>
    <li> My son loves this floss.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> Stronger than floss so it does not break while using. I have not been able to find it lately in stores in the Houston area.  Product arrived on time and as described</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this product years ago and I have used it ever since.</li>
    <li> No one else I know can use this stuff, but my teeth are extremely crowded and tight because I kept my wisdoms and retained a baby tooth until I was 58. None of the other products I have tried work as well as dental tape, and J&amp;J Reach is best. Believe me, I&#x27;ve tried the cheaper brands and generics.</li>
    <li> Better price on item I use all the time. There was never any at the market. So I bought a lot of 6 &amp; saved.</li>
    <li> Much too thick for my tightly spaced teeth.</li>
    <li> I had almost thought J&amp;J stopped making dentotape as I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores but then I came across this.  The packaging is different now but it is just as good as how I remember it.  Great product if you have wide spaced teeth or narrow roots at the base.</li>
    <li> Exactly what we were looking for.  For some reason Dentotape is impossible to find around here anymore especially in the 100 yd quantity.  Not sure if Johnson stopped making it or if local business just don&#x27;t carry it.  The smaller rolls only last a few days.  Tape is the only thing my family uses, as floss is pretty much useless.  Quick delivery, great customer service.  thanks much</li>
    <li> I prefer tape to standard floss because I think it cleans better.  I have a mix of tight spaces and larger gaps between my teeth (and bridgework) and I find the tape works well in both bases.  I love my dentotape and never use standard floss anymore.</li>
    <li> My wife and I both use this floss it is thicker than most and you get more per spool. Our teeth aren&#x27;t so closely gapped to prevent use&lt;br /&gt;of this floss. We find it to be less damaging to our gums. Not so sharp and cutting as the thinner ones. It&#x27;s not flavored which is all right&lt;br /&gt;by us. Being wider it seems to cover more area of the tooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joseph</li>
    <li> best on the market!....</li>
    <li> Works great for me even though I have tight contacts between my teeth.</li>
    <li> Best dentotape  ever--couldn&#x27;t  find it in  any store.</li>
    <li> I would almost describe this floss as macho. You know it&#x27;s in your teeth and it gets everything out. And I doubt it will ever  snap during a pull. The wimpification of dental floss has not effected this product! ... No, seriously. I love this floss and am glad I got a 6 pack.</li>
    <li> This is a product which I am have great difficulty finding in stores.  Due to the wide spacing of my teeth, I need this type of product, rather than traditional dental floss.  Having dental tape online is a huge &amp;#34;find&amp;#34; for me and my dental hygiene!</li>
    <li> I have had gum problems ever since a car accident knocked my teeth loose many years ago.  I&#x27;ve always flossed, but my dentist recommended doubling the floss as a means of really cleaning between the teeth and stimulating the gums, because, as his assistant said, \\&quot;You just can&#x27;t find that good dental tape anymore.\\&quot;  That, apparently, is what is the most effective.  I looked everywhere for it, and I FINALLY found it on Amazon.  This was certainly the best priced anywhere, and it does the trick!  I don&#x27;t have to use two pieces of dental floss now -- just the one piece of Dentotape.  And it doesn&#x27;t shred or break like the regular floss tends to do.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!!  NEver shreds</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended his floss to me and I don&#x27;t have a wide spaced teeth. However this floss does an effective job removing particles from my teeth and it  feels clean after each use. I am very impressed with this product.</li>
    <li> Product was just as advertised and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> This wide tape is very difficult, if not impossible to find in stores.  It really does the job between teeth and is tough enough to reduce placque also. I have no trouble fitting it between my closer spaced teeth either.  Buying multiple packs at once, saves money and allows me to store it in different places in the house so I don&#x27;t have to hunt it down when I need it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only dental tape????</li>
    <li> i love this floss. it&#x27;s great for my wide teeth. I bought these in amazon and it&#x27;s cheaper than any department store.</li>
    <li> Best floss I&#x27;ve used so far. Nothing else comes close to this.</li>
    <li> been using it for years, still love it</li>
    <li> Nice, thick dental floss. But it&#x27;s not too thick that I can&#x27;t fit it between tighter spaces. Flosses well.</li>
    <li> Does not shred so far, nice and just the right thickness</li>
    <li> I am glad I found these on Amazon.  It has been very difficult to locate the denotape extra wide  dental floss in my area.  The price was cheaper on Amazon then purchasing them at the local drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We love the denotape better than the regular thinner dental floss.  We will purchase again via Amazon/</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s different than the last tape I used.  Thicker around, thus stronger.  Tho not wider.  Better than the common string that the dentist provides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also coated it with hot glue and used it in place of duct tape.  And tied off my friend&#x27;s colon, since he could not afford laparoscopic surgery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I might suggest, sell it in different colors too.</li>
    <li> I love this dentotape, this was a great deal!</li>
    <li> This floss tape is too thick, &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; and breaks too easily for normal teeth. It&#x27;s &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; and breaks easily, meaning it does not glide in. It tends to &#x27;hang up&amp;#34; and get caught in tight spots at the ends of teeth and break. At times if you put enough pressure on the tape it will make it through the tight spots and come down to the gum line with such force that it will cause bleeding. I have a bleeding sore from these repeated &amp;#34;breakthroughs&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t think the tape was designed for humans. Now I have 5 100 yard containers left over that are useless.</li>
    <li> It seems like it might just be the genuine article!</li>
    <li> this is my favorite type of floss: it doesn&#x27;t shred, it&#x27;s thick enough to really clean my widely spaced teeth, and it doesn&#x27;t have a fake mint flavor.  i used to be able to find it in the stores, but no more.  i&#x27;m so glad i could get it via amazon -- thank you!</li>
    <li> What can one say about dental floss? Why would someone buying dental floss need to read a review? Why would Amazon ask for a review? Ah, questions for the ages. Anyway, this particular type of floss is a favorite of mine and have used it for decades. It is strong and will not unravel. Even though waxed, it will adhere to the index fingers well meaning it will not slip while flossing. One extra benefit is that it is great for slicing cake. Of course, that requires a longer piece than the length required for flossing.</li>
    <li> It is all what it claims to be.It is the best Dental Tape/Floss I&#x27;ve ever used!You need NOT to have wide spaced teeth to use it.Unlike Floss,this TAPE is very gentle on once gums.</li>
    <li> This product works.  However, it sometimes shreds and can be difficult to dislodge.  They should use a better quality string.  It works best if you only draw a given length once between teeth, then draw the rest through.  That prevents shredding for me. Occasionally, the floss shreds if two teeth are very tight, but if you use it every day that shouldn&#x27;t happen often.  I re-purchased because there was nothing better, but I suspect there are better dental tapes out ther.  I used to use the rite aid store brand, and I think that&#x27;s better.</li>
    <li> Great product and great price!</li>
    <li> The floss itself is NOT extra wide. It is THIN and gets stringy after one pass over tooth. NO LIKE.</li>
    <li> Good floss for cleaning your teeth.</li>
    <li> My purchase of this item was multiple units.  Reason?  Simple.  In my area there is one store that carries this product (small town) and was always out.  Found this on Amazon and bought many.  One less thing to buy locally.</li>
    <li> Works great and I&#x27;ll probably not have to buy floss for years now.</li>
    <li> She really enjoys this brand and design, so I picked them up for a gift :)&lt;br /&gt;Sealed package.&lt;br /&gt;Look new.&lt;br /&gt;Perform well.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing unusual.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described and quick delivery</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t  be found in stores anymore, I think this is the most exciting thing to happen in oral hygiene-I have my favorite floss back !</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s the deal with these running out so fast at the stores.  6 individually packaged dentotape was mailed in a ziplock bag, in a pouch.  Simple, no damage and just what I ordered.  I don&#x27;t have wide spaced teeth, but they perform exceptionally well at cleaning in between teeth.  I&#x27;d highly recommend this to anyone, with or without wide spaced teeth.</li>
    <li> This just isn&#x27;t widely available.  Kudos to Amazon for  carrying it.  It may not be everyone&#x27;s perfect floss, but for those us who love it, nothing else takes its place.</li>
    <li> So glad I can find this at Amazon and order a small quantity at a great price. Thanks</li>
    <li> I have used other store brands of dental tape (waxed) and they do not glide as easily between teeth.  Sometimes there really is a difference in Brand Name items, and this is one of them</li>
    <li> the floss is just what I wanted it is perfect and I will order it again and again</li>
    <li> Same stuff I&#x27;ve been buying for years, still works great.</li>
    <li> Came as promised - perfect shape!</li>
    <li> falls apart(splits) and shreds w/ very little use</li>
    <li> I have gaps between my teeth and Dentotape cleans my teeth.  It&#x27;s all I use and I love it!</li>
    <li> Fabulous. Always impossible to find.  Too popular?</li>
    <li> This is a great dental tape.  Have used it for years... twice a day.  A little wider than the normal dental floss, so if you have teeth that are very close together, that might be a consideration.  However, having said that, I would not be without it, It does a great job.</li>
    <li> Came quickly &amp; love the product</li>
    <li> I had a hard time finding my favorite dental floss in the local CVS, Target etc stores lately, so I got it online. The price is about the same. Great product.</li>
    <li> I like this better than regular floss, it gets the gunk out of my teeth very well.</li>
    <li> The product itself is fine.  But Amazon is too expensive on this one.  They should lower their price so they are priced in line with others who sell this product.</li>
    <li> Great Buy on a product I can&#x27;t find in local stores any longer!!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and great deal.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. I could only find this on Amazon!!</li>
    <li> This i s the only floss I will ever use!!  It is wide enough to actually do the job!  Sometimes I can&#x27;t find it in the stores so I ordered it her in the multi packs.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with this floss</li>
    <li> It may seem strange to mail order dental floss, but this unflavored dentotape is hard to find in local stores.  Regular dental floss shreds very easily today, but this holds up much better.  Also the package of 100 yards lasts much longer than the small spools.  One note, however. Dentotape is somewhat thicker than regular floss.  I don&#x27;t have a problem, but it will not work for people who don&#x27;t have enough space between their teeth.  Still, if they do have enough space for it, dentotape cleans out more plaque.</li>
    <li> This floss is horrible. It breaks very easily, shreds and gets stuck between my teeth. Worst floss I ever used. And my dentist recommended it too. Going back to Oral B.</li>
    <li> Much to my chagrin, I was always asked by the dental hygienist whether I &amp;#34;really floss&amp;#34; my teeth everyday until I started using this floss. Then it disappeared from Walmart! Was glad to finally find it at Amazon. Now the same dental hygienist wants to know what floss I use cos she has noticed &amp;#34;such a huge improvement&amp;#34;  with my gums and teeth in the last 12 months!</li>
    <li> I use &amp;#34;tape&amp;#34; all the time so I was excited to see this deal. However, this was more like heavily waxed floss rather than tape so I decided to stick with my original brand. Passed a one on to my mom who said she was pleased with the product. She liked that it was unflavored (hard to find these days), waxed and priced right (free to her). Gave her half the order - enough to last a few years. The remainder I will donate.  Glad so many others are pleased with their purchase but I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Just as described, arrived promptly, thank you!</li>
    <li> Love this floss and thrilled that it&#x27;s available through Amazon.  You win, Walmart looses!!</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find the Reach Dentotape.  After checking a few stores, it seems dentotape is not available in my area.  My dentists have all recommended dentotape vice dental floss for use on my teeth.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this floss to help get the plaque better between my teeth. I find that it shreds easily compared to Glide and other brands but it depends on what your goal is for the floss. I find that I have to use more than other brands to get all of my teeth due to the shredding.</li>
    <li> Thank goodness I can buy on Amazon because it&#x27;s not easy to find in the stores now.  I have always used this brand and love it</li>
    <li> Thick dental tape that cleans out spacier teeth without breaking.</li>
    <li> Dental tape is getting harder to find in the brick and mortar stores. This is a good find!</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted, haven&#x27;t been able to find it locally!</li>
    <li> your product is much easier to purchase on-line because it is not readily available in many stores. your product is what i am looking for in a floss/dentotape. thanks, a. tillas</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.  I was unable to find Dentotape in stores near me.</li>
    <li> This feels like flossing with raw twine. It&#x27;s too thick and doesn&#x27;t have enough wax on it. Feels like I&#x27;m going to yank out a tooth every morning and evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m used to Glide floss which I love. Amazon is out of the Glide unflavored stuff right now, so I bought the Reach floss. Mistake. This stuff is not good at all.</li>
    <li> A great product at an even better price.  Works better than floss for me.  Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> The Reach Dentotape is my floss of choice.  I find it difficult to find in stores.  The product is the real thing and delivered as promised.</li>
    <li> I have been using this dental floss for several years because it is thicker and does a better job on teeth that are wide spaced.  I ordered it from Amazon because Walmart did not have it in stock after several weeks.  The product arrived on time as promised.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 six packs about a year ago and so far I have had 2 jammed dispensers. When the tape is pulled hard in an effort to free the jam the container opens and the tape roll flies out. I have not found a good way to reassemble the dispenser and tape roll so I end up throwing it out. If it weren&#x27;t for the unreliable packaging I would give it 5 stars because it works well for tight teeth.</li>
    <li> Best dental floss/tape on the market.  Small price to pay compared to dentist bills.  Use Listerine, too, and your teeth will love you.</li>
    <li> I have to purchase this online because I don&#x27;t seem to be able to find it in California.  Everything here is junk.  Dave</li>
    <li> This is a great product if you have a little extra space between your teeth. This is the best product I&#x27;ve found for that issue.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this in retail stores and it is the best floss I have ever used.  I like the thickness.  It&#x27;s got some guts and bite.</li>
    <li> Hard to find in our local stores, but the product is great for maintaining dental hygiene. Does not break easily and cleans much better compared to regular thin floss.  My dentist always recommends Dentotape.</li>
    <li> This is what my wife uses.  This is the best place to buy it</li>
    <li> Very helpful for people with more space between teeth.</li>
    <li> Great Floss for my teeth. Waxed helps slide through my teeth. My dentist recommended.</li>
    <li> This dental floss is becoming harder to find it in the stores. As a daily user, I need to have plenty on hand. It is too thick for extra tight spaces, which I had before teeth straightening. Now this is the kind I prefer over the fine versions. Was so glad to find these through amazon, and now I&#x27;m stocked up for months. Shipping was fast and free.</li>
    <li> What a buy!  This stuff is hard to find anymore, so I got a couple of 6 pack for peanuts.  Should last a very long time.  Service was good too.</li>
    <li> I use this every day but cannot buy it anywhere in my area.</li>
    <li> Works better than floss with teeth that aren&#x27;t too close together. Negative side is that it breaks easier than other brands of dental tape in tight spaces.  Positive is that it doesn&#x27;t fray and leave small fibers stuck in your teeth like other dental tapes.  Reach dentotape is hard to find in retail stores and generally expensive.  Good value from Amazon</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great, works exactly as I had hoped it would.  I also was very pleased with the price.</li>
    <li> i like thicker floss and this fits the price.  it cleans better</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great to be able to find dentotape, since regular markets and pharmacies have apparently stopped carrying it!!!</li>
    <li> Floss works fine, but I had to open up the receptacle for the ones that I&#x27;ve used so far because the wax on the floss had melted, thus the floss won&#x27;t dispense just by pulling it.  Once opened, it was easy to unwind the floss and use as intended. Also, some of the plastic tubes holding the floss were cracked. You can&#x27;t tell until you open the floss container, but it was not an issue.  Not sure if bad batch or shipping or storage issues. (Purely speculative, but relevant because it reflects the real and actual condition of the product that arrived and the dispenser is part of the product.  I do not feel the need to grade the seller nor contact them for a refund or exchange because the floss itself was fine.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Wrote a review but did not know that feedback on sellers should be done through other means.  (I did not name names nor imply that sellers/shippers are good/bad, Amazon.com! )</li>
    <li> Flossing is key to dental health, and I take that to the heart. So much that I bought the six-pack of these and faithfully use the floss every night.&lt;br /&gt;If you have larger gaps between your teeth, this will help take out food that is stuck - however for my tighter spaced teeth I use a thinner floss because this Dentotape will get stuck or cause pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must use for wider spaced teeth, but not recommended for bridges or crowns which may be shifted or budged with this wide floss.</li>
    <li> My favorite floss.  Won&#x27;t work well for teeth that are really tight against each other, but great for implants and crowns.  Helps get more plaque out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s dental tape, no more and no less</li>
    <li> Best dental floss ever. I bought a several year supply because you can not buy it in stores any longer. I assume it might be discontinued and do not want to be without it. Many years a Dentist recommended this and have used it ever since. It makes a huge difference keeping teeth clean and also below the gum. I have never had a cavity since and never any tartar build up at cleanings when I visit Dentist. Most important, if you use this daily, you teeth feel clean unlike any clean you could get from brushing alone.  Glide brand is not even close</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing this item for a number of years.  Unfortunately, it was removed from store shelves.  Wish I knew why.  It has a great flavor and does a superb job of flossing.  Why do these items have to be removed?  It is a bit pricey but it is fantastic.</li>
    <li> This product is thick, flat dental floss--shaped more like a ribbon than a tiny piece of string.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist recommends this as the best floss on the market. He told me this because he wanted me to stop using Glide, which I really liked but he said is not as effective for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for me, I have been using it now for two years and I actually do notice that it cleans better than regular floss. I can tell when I travel and don&#x27;t bring it, and buy floss where I am (where it isn&#x27;t available) I notice my mouth has a scummy feeling more often. This floss, whenever I use it for several weeks, gives my mouth the cleanest feeling of any floss I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t break like other floss&lt;br /&gt;No flavor (I HATE flavor in dental floss)&lt;br /&gt;Cleans the best of any floss I&#x27;ve tried&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;If your teeth are very tight together, this product may not be for you. My teeth are normal (not particularly widely spaced) and it works great. But I can imagine someone with very tight gaps would find this hard to get in between teeth.</li>
    <li> My husband has me hunt for this product, as it is his favorite type. He likes the unflavored option, because mint stings.</li>
    <li> My family prefers taped for flossing. This is great.</li>
    <li> Good floss at a great value. Not as easy as Glide but probably cleans a little better.</li>
    <li> love this dento tape. They just don&#x27;t sell it in the stores. I never find it. I finally had to purchase this pack of 6 and I am in heaven. Does the job! I don&#x27;t have large spaces in between my teeth but the thinner glide stuff just doesn&#x27;t do the trick. This works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Great deal, dental tape is getting harder to find in stores.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and ordered.  Very easy process.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this floss for years.  I strongly recommend purchasing J&amp;J brand to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great product; fast delivery</li>
    <li> So happy to find this. My husband will only use dental tape and it is getting harder and harder to find in the stores. No more complaining from him now!</li>
    <li> Hard to find this in stores...I love the way it keeps my teeth clean between without shredding...</li>
    <li> Very hard to find in stores.  Dental tape is the way to go for floss.  Once you try it you don&#x27;t want to go back to anything else.</li>
    <li> I really like using this floss and have difficulty finding it in my local drug stores.  Great price as well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great to still be able to find this product, as it has been discontinued at many of the big block retailers. Re the product itself: the tape seems a bit thinner than the classic waxed dentotape made by J&amp;J. I&#x27;m wondering if the company is tweaking quality levels in order to increase their profit margin. This tape is not much thicker than regular floss. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Since I have big spaces between my teeth I thought this specific floss would help me. I&#x27;m happy to report that it has and I feel it does the job very well. If you have the same issues, I would suggest this for you.</li>
    <li> Too thick for my liking. If you have huge spaces between your teeth this is your product. I had to jam it through to floss. I &#x27;ve since bought a thinner one.</li>
    <li> Hard to find this in the stores anymore, better than regular dental floss.</li>
    <li> The preferred product in quantity at a great price delivered right to my door. Who could ask for more?</li>
    <li> The shipment was just as expected.</li>
    <li> I really like this dental tape. I had been using Walgreen&#x27;s brand for years but was looking for a better value. Not only is this less expensive - it is a better product in that it works more smoothly and doesn&#x27;t shred.</li>
    <li> The only dental tape my husband will use.</li>
    <li> This is dental tape, not floss.....my thanks to the many kind folks who responded to my question about whether it was extra wide tape. It is NOT extra wide tape, its just regular normal dental tape, as opposed to dental floss. This dental tape is strong, the waxing keeps it from fraying and slipping while trying to hold it when using.....results are far superior to dental floss.  Excellent product, great value this!</li>
    <li> Always buy this kind of floss. Does not break and slides between teeth with ease.</li>
    <li> I really like the Dentotape Extra Wide Waxed Tape, and will be ordering more later.</li>
    <li> happy with what I got.</li>
    <li> This is the best Dental Tape there is.  Can&#x27;t find it at the stores anymore  because of it&#x27;s thickness it works the best on getting that plaque off the lower front teeth and my dentist is always amazed at how good my teeth look.</li>
    <li> Too wide for my closely spaced teeth.  This non-mint waxed floss is mildly annoying due to its waxy taste.  Reach makes much better products for me.</li>
    <li> Brush and floss! J&amp;J makes the best dental tape.</li>
    <li> Good product. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> We are not new users of dentotape and not being able to find above item in local stores we have ordered it online.  Long ago our dentist(s) favored tape over floss so we shall continue to do so and find it satisfactory.</li>
    <li> Thicker than normal floss, shreds less during use, stronger.  Overall good product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the only floss that actually cleans your teeth.  It&#x27;s a lot thicker so it takes more work if your teeth are tight.</li>
    <li> Hands down best floss I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the floss they give you at the dentist. Super thick and hurts like hell at first. After some time, your gums get used to the utter decimation of things between your teeth that this floss causes. Totally worth using compared to the thin and flimsy floss they normally sell at department stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10 out of 10 would floss again.</li>
    <li> New packaging but the dentotape is the same as what was in the old &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; container.  It&#x27;s just right for my teeth.  My dentist is happy with the way I care for my teeth, and I&#x27;m assuming the dentotape plays a big part in keeping my teeth clean.  Buying the pack of 6, after shipping and handling charges, it comes to under $4 per containers, so for me, it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
    <li> On time, great price.</li>
    <li> Used to buy this from Walmart but is not available at the stores anymore.  I prefer this as the floss tape is thicker than the floss and feel it does a better job.  My dentist said it doesn&#x27;t make any difference but my personal preference is the tape.  Glad I found this on Amazon.</li>
    <li> As a former Dental Assistant, this Dentotape is mandatory for keeping your teeth clean between Dentist visits. Much better than regular floss! I can never find it in the pharmacy anymore, and I don&#x27;t know why!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Reach dental tape ever since my dentist recommended it (not sure why he recommends tape over floss, but oh well) and I must say my teeth feel cleaner than ever after using it.  You really feel like it&#x27;s getting deep in there and taking out the muck.  Feels weird not flossing now...</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t break or shred leaving filaments of floss stuck in your teeth.</li>
    <li> prefer this over dental floss. better at removing food between the teeth.</li>
    <li> Way more tape than I expected</li>
    <li> Received it efficiently.  It was just what I expected.</li>
    <li> Item was as described, shipped on time.</li>
    <li> If you have tight spacing between your teeth, Denotape is the way to go. I shred normal floss and the silky gortex fiber stuff is the worst (for me). It&#x27;s harder to find in brick and mortar stores and much more expensive than ordering on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping item as described</li>
    <li> best dental floss ever. hard to find in local stores</li>
    <li> BEST TAPE ON MARKET, I CAN NOT USE REG. FLOSS, TOO THIN, CUTS GUMS, , IF YOU FLOSS REG. YOU WILL NOT GO BACK TO REG. THIN, BREAKABLE FLOSS.</li>
    <li> I have tight contacts between my teeth and a mouth full of implants, root canals and crowns.  To protect the huge investment I have in my teeth I need a floss that really works.  This stuff is it.  I can&#x27;t find it in stores, so thank goodness for Amazon.</li>
    <li> Works as expected.  For teeth with room between.</li>
    <li> Excellent Brand and product; and excellent service getting the product to me.</li>
    <li> Dont buy it if your teeth are crowded.</li>
    <li> This is the best dental floss!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent dentotape.&lt;br /&gt;I could not find this product in any drug store and I am so happy Amazone has it. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The product (Reach Dentotape) arrived on time and was exactly what I was wanting.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Met and exceeded requirements</li>
    <li> Love the wider tape for my toofuses! Use this everyday!</li>
    <li> The product was exactly what I wanted and delivered quickly.</li>
    <li> I love the product.  I have not been able to find it in any stores.  I use it everyday for me it works so much better then regular dental floss.  I was so happy to find it on Amazon.  Jo</li>
    <li> I love this Floss. Unfortunately, I bought it from the seller AmericaRX and was send a COMPLETELY different item. I mean it was still REACH floss but it wasn&#x27;t the one pictured and the floss was not the same thickness or variety as what I should have received. So, just beware of what seller you are actually buying this from.</li>
    <li> We can&#x27;t find the tape locally.  It was great to be able to get it this way--Was exactly as I expected.</li>
    <li> This stuff is hard to find, except on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I got EXACTLY what I was wanting!&lt;br /&gt;Job well done, Thanks!</li>
    <li> First: This stuff is kinda pricey, but worth it in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely thicker than ordinary dental floss. If you&#x27;re teeth are very close together like mine are, then it&#x27;s tough to get it between teeth but IMO worth the effort. It&#x27;s like pulling a rope between your teeth and definitely cleans very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist says that I&#x27;m a boring patient because I only ever need simple cleanings, but he wishes everyone flossed as well as I do. I give the credit to the dentotape.</li>
    <li> I like this product but would like an even wider, thicker tape- i have peridontal disease with wide spaces.</li>
    <li> Great price for the floss I have used for years!</li>
    <li> Arrived in time.  Ordered the pack of 6 -can&#x27;t seem to find it anywhere else.  Dentotape is the best for flossing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always preferred this wider floss and was thrilled to find it on Amazon, and the price can&#x27;t be beat.  I didn&#x27;t really want a six-pack, but the price was way better than retail stores and these six will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Great price for value</li>
    <li> I have used Reach Dentotape for years.  I have \\&quot;open contacts\\&quot; between my teeth and regular thin floss breaks when I try to push it between the teeth, so I really need the extra strength of dental tape.  Recently this product has disappeared from all the \\&quot;brick and mortar\\&quot; stores.  I&#x27;m delighted that I can still find it at Amazon.  Thanks for continuing to carry it!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite kind of floss. It was shipped quickly and met all my expectations</li>
    <li> Good service, no surprises</li>
    <li> My favorite dental floss.</li>
    <li> Good value for the price.</li>
    <li> The only floss my family uses. Every other floss shreds in our teeth and cuts into our fingers. It&#x27;s ridiculously hard to find retail, so I&#x27;m thrilled we can get it via Amazon. Good price too.</li>
    <li> Tried the drug store brands (cheaper) none worked - they leave strands between the teeth.  Dentotape works!  Well worth the money</li>
    <li> And that even rythmes!&lt;br /&gt;Seriously - I like this stuff.  It&#x27;s thick, and gets all the gunk out.  Don&#x27;t use it if your teeth are too crowded.</li>
    <li> This floss is very thick. I have to fight to get it between my teeth. It often frays when I finally get it out from between two teeth. I do not recommend this floss unless you have A LOT of space between your teeth.</li>
    <li> It is easy to use and cleans my teeth well.  It was recommended by my dentist.  The 100 yard container lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> They were exactly as expected</li>
    <li> This is a hard-to-find item online, but is superior to reguar floss. It&#x27;s way stronger and does a better job of scrubbing the sides of the teeth.</li>
    <li> Five stars for the floss.  This is great stuff, particularly if you you have a bit of space between your teeth.  Good price for 6 rolls.  Zero stars for the order accuracy.  I received only four rolls, not six.  Amazon sent me a replacement order and had me return the first four.  Does this make sense?  I asked them just to send me the missing two rolls.  It&#x27;s their dime to return the short order, but this seems silly to me.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find this product in stores.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Was only able to acquire online.  Thank you like this product very much.</li>
    <li> I like it because it is a tape and does a superior job.  I could not find it locally.  I got it once at walmart but then it was not stocked anymore.  I did not need six but that was the most economical purchase.</li>
    <li> ad says extra wide waxed tape. I&#x27;ll tell you - it is not extra wide.</li>
    <li> Love the thicker floss..and the multi pack means I can have it everywhere!</li>
    <li> My wife and I have been using the denotape for years and prefer nothing else. For some reason the stores hardly carry them anymore. So we were really bummed until I checked online and to my surprise there it was.</li>
    <li> It you prefer wider tape rather than plain floss, this is what you want.</li>
    <li> Hard to find this in our local stores.  Great price and 6 will last quite a long time before I have to order again</li>
    <li> Detal tape is much better than detal floss.  The tape seems to be rearly stocked by retail outlets. My only concern is that I should have purchased more.  I am in Australia and we never see the 100 yd packs here.</li>
    <li> Service excellent so is product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Just what we needed.  Should last a while.  We have been having trouble getting them in stores.</li>
    <li> I purchased for my dental office even thoughy the Publix brand are much cheaper and it&#x27;s OK for home use.  However, professional need high quality floss and Reach Dentotape is that.  You will pay 25%-30% more than Publix brand and not sure it worth for home use.  If I were regular consumer I would buy from Publix $0.89 for 55 yards, but for patients I need to have the best</li>
    <li> This is a great item for dental hygiene. Need to produce and supply worldwide in this 21th Century. Why not?</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and for whatever reason it is impossible to find it in a retail store.  The one misconception about dental tape is that it does not work for people whose teeth are tighly spaced.  This is truly a misnomer.  My teeth are tight and i f I run out of tape, (which rarely happens as I keep a stock pile) and am forced to use &amp;#34;floss,&amp;#34; I do not feel my teeth are clean!  Call me OCD, but I have great teeth!</li>
    <li> Works great. We love it. Been using for years..</li>
    <li> This is the only brand of dental floss I use. They are perfect for my teeth which I guess have wide gaps.</li>
    <li> husband likes it - so I guess its good.</li>
    <li> I bought the 6-pack of these because my teeth are close together and tear apart most dental floss.  I remembered that the Johnson &amp; Johnson (the label before it was called &amp;#34;Reach&amp;#34;) UNWAXED dental tape I used to buy would get me through a full flossing with no breaking.  They didn&#x27;t have it at my grocery store or costco so I found it here (at least the waxed version).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they must have changed the formula, because my teeth are shredding this floss - just as easily as all the other types of floss my wife and I have tried.  It&#x27;s possible that the waxed tape always performed like this and that the unwaxed would still work, but I couldn&#x27;t find any unwaxed for sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it&#x27;s partly my fault - I should have tried one package before I bought 6.  I just assumed this would perform as well as the J&amp;J tape from 10-20 years ago did...</li>
    <li> The dentotape is so much easier to use and tear off so I always get the right amount of string.  Recommend this Dentotape for the many people that floss each night and sometimes during the day - it&#x27;s easy to tear off and goes easily between each tooth.</li>
    <li> Need this item for dental implants</li>
    <li> According to my dentist, thick, waxed dental floss is the best for cleaning plaque between teeth. This 6&#x3D;pack is a good deal.</li>
    <li> I use this twice a day so need quite a bit over the year. This was an excellent price for an excellent product.</li>
    <li> My husbund won&#x27;t use any other kind.</li>
    <li> much better price than drugstore.</li>
    <li> Unaware the product was &#x27;extra thick&#x27; prior to receiving my order.  Trying to contact seller to see if i can try one and return if it doesn&#x27;t work for me.  The other option would be to return the whole package.  No option on my &#x27;Orders&#x27; to merely &#x27;Contact Seller&#x27;</li>
    <li> Hard to find in regular stores anymore.  Now I&#x27;ve got a lifetime supply of best floss ever.  Reach for it!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B003XDVERE Reach Dentotape, Designed for wide spaced teeth. Unflavored, Waxed Floss,100 Yard (Pack of 6)]]  Not one of the new slippery flosses that are too thin and can&#x27;t be held - this is the real stuff: old-fashioned, thick, strong, for teeth that have been around for awhile and need serious flossing, just like mine.  100 yards in small package for a very good price</li>
    <li> I was blessed with more space between my teeth than the avg person (which means less dental issues in the long term), but need a good floss that can be effective due to this. Flossing is more important than brushing for long term care.  I am glad I can order floss like this on Amazon since I often am unable to find the dental tape easily in local stores.</li>
    <li> I used to be bad about flossing... until needing to see a periodontist for gum recession.  Even when I started flossing regularly, I apparently wasn&#x27;t as effective as I should have been.  However, when using the Dentotape, it&#x27;s a little bit sticky, so it catches the stuff between your teeth.  The other one I was using (Glide) slid inbetween my teeth easier, but it also slid right out without removing everything.  The Dentotape has been much better at cleaning those hard to brush spots.</li>
    <li> I like it because it doesn&#x27;t tare or break while using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t find this dental TAPE anywhere locally.&lt;br /&gt;Because Amazon carried it I bought a case just in case it gets discontinued.</li>
    <li> fast delivery luv dental tape as opposed to reg floss and at a fair price</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and have always been more than satisfied. I think it is easier to use and much more thorough than simple dental floss. Problem is, I am finding it harder to find in local markets or drug stores.</li>
    <li> All of the other floss products I have used breakdown, split or get caught in my teeth. Denotape is far superior to any of the other brands- bar none and I have tried them all.</li>
    <li> My family prefers this over other brands.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so strong I used it to tow my car behind the truck when it got stuck in a ditch. I keep a spare roll of this now in the glove box just for emergency situations... Needless to say, when flossing my kids teeth with it, there are no issues whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Best quality tape that works hard for you. This is my absolute favorite, and my checkups are better for using it regularly.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get it to go between my teeth.  On the package flyer that came with it, it boasts &amp;#34;for widely spaced teeth&amp;#34;.  Beware.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m having difficulty using this product as some teeth are very close together and the space between them difficult to allow the tape to get through.  Once through, if possible, getting it back out is also very difficult if not impossible.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
    <li> The Dentotape is a well recognized product that is priced very well.</li>
    <li> I like it. Hey, it&#x27;s just dental tape.</li>
    <li> These are discontinued, so I heard cuz I can&#x27;t find them in store but since my father likes them I stocked him up on them.</li>
    <li> This is a good product that I have bought over a year ago and am reordering;  and like many other reviewers, I cannot understand why the local retail stores no longer stock it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doug .... 7/26/14</li>
    <li> The best out there at a good deal.</li>
    <li> arrive on time, good price, excellent products on market</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.  Good buy.</li>
    <li> My Boyfriend and I like the Dentotape much better then Dentofloss but I have a heck of a time finding it at the stores these days. So glad i check Amazon.....and found it there.</li>
    <li> I love this type of dental tape and was so very glad to find it in bulk since I can rarely find it in stores anymore. Arrived smoothly without problems.</li>
    <li> The best! I&#x27;m a dental assistant for 36 years and it&#x27;s the only one I recommend. It doesn&#x27;t tear/shred or leave pieces in your teeth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m already familiar with the product, and had no desire to switch to anything else, except for other possible brands (if they were available) of the same thing.</li>
    <li> best for my teeth and gums</li>
    <li> Johnson and Johnson Reach dentotape is very difficult to find in local stores.  I know of only one that carries it and due to the popularity it is usually gone when I go to the store.  It was great to find it on Amazon where it is only a click away.  It was delivered in two days and now I have a supply that will last for a couple months no more searching.</li>
    <li> Have used this product forever.  More important than the toothbrush for maintaining oral health and, by extension, a healthy life.</li>
    <li> Jimmy has used this product for many years, and it&#x27;s the only one that he will ever use.  He doesn&#x27;t like flavored products of any kind, unless it&#x27;s food!  And it works great for him.</li>
    <li> Great product. Does the job very well at a very good price.</li>
    <li> Glad I found these on Amazon. They are just like the ones that were sold in stores.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find &amp;#34;dental tape&amp;#34;locally. I don&#x27;t like floss.  The price was more than fair and delivery was right on.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> The only tooth floss my husband uses.  I have been unable to find it in retail outlets in the US and as we are currently expats, I ordered the 6 pack to bring with me in case I was unable to find Dentotape out of country.  It&#x27;s a personal preference thing, as I prefer Satin Tape myself, a similar product but one that doesn&#x27;t shred between my tight teeth.</li>
    <li> Best floss out there period. This will not break as all the other ones tried over the years will do.</li>
    <li> this is the only kind of tape my husband can use since it does not shred in his mouth. i can only find it on amazon</li>
    <li> Have been using this dentotape for decades. It&#x27;s getting harder to find this exact size and type in our supermarket. mMch more covenient to buy in quantity via Amazon.</li>
    <li> The only floss for those of us with tight teeth. Does not shred or split. Cheaper with Amazon and delivered to the door.</li>
    <li> The best floss ever.  Bought this cuz it is gone from all stores.  Stock up before the Apocalypse.</li>
    <li> I found out from my dentist that was I wasn&#x27;t flossing well enough and she recommended this product. After using the sample, my teeth truly felt more clean. I couldn&#x27;t believe what a difference this floss made for me... Much better than the floss that just glides in... Those flosses aren&#x27;t trapping the plaque and particles like this one.</li>
    <li> We love this floss. We have difficult areas on the very back molar that trap food. This is the only floss that is able to remove particles easily and without shredding.</li>
    <li> This is not extra wide waxed tape.  I do not like it at all.  I have switched to Oral B Glide which is &amp;#34;wide&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This Reach Denotape works well for my daily flossing needs. I like this better than standard floss since my teeth are  mostly spaced fairly well apart and this seems more effective. The wax coating make the tape slide better between tighter teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get this here in Germany and am glad that I can get it online.  It is the only type of floss that I use as it works the best for me.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Just what the wife ordered</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t break like floss which is thinner</li>
    <li> Good floss if you have small gaps in your teeth.  If you can double or triple your average dental floss and it still fits between your teeth, this floss will  work well for you.  When used between really tight teeth, it does tend to shred a little, but otherwise, it&#x27;s a great product.  It says it comes in a 6-pack, but when I received it, there was only one, so I thought that perhaps it was just equal to six regular packs of dental floss in one container (it is a large container - 3&amp;#34; tall and one square inch around).  Then, I re-ordered, and sure enough, 6 separate packs came.</li>
    <li> It is hard to find dental tape in stores.  You see a lot of dental floss, but it is very difficult to find tape in my area.  The tape does a better job of flossing because it is thicker and it does not cut your gums while using it. Also, the quality and the quantity is a good value.</li>
    <li> Its not extra wide, its extra thick, which is the problem.</li>
    <li> I kill regular floss, so the wider tape doesn&#x27;t fall apart and seems to do a better job cleaning between teeth.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this floss and it works very well. It is strong and doesn&#x27;t break.</li>
    <li> Excellent. I can&#x27;t find this product in any of my usual stores who used to carry it.</li>
    <li> Affordable price and arrived timely.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and price!</li>
    <li> Have used this brand for years. Works very well.</li>
    <li> Perfect for those of us with widely spaced teeth (childhood orthodontia removed too many of my teeth and left annoying gaps that always catch chicken and other stringy things).  Dentotape is not suitable for anyone with normal spacings, however; if you think &#x27;glide&#x27; tape does anything at all for you, your spaces are probably not big enough for this stuff.  But I love it!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find these in stores without spending lots of money in gas looking.  So glad to find them online.</li>
    <li> This is the kind of dental tape my husband likes and we were not able to find it in stores where we live. It doesn&#x27;t fray like dental floss and as he has some space between his teeth, it cleans better than floss. We are very glad that Amazon had it and it came in a pack of 6, so we are good for awhile.</li>
    <li> I was very happy to find this product. In Canada I can only find this floss in mint flavour, which I don&#x27;t care for.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this purchase. This dental tape is thicker than others and works very well for me. I highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I cannot find this floss in any retail store. And I&#x27;m not sure why because it flosses better than any floss on the market in my opinion. It&#x27;s thicker (obviously) and gets in between teeth to grab debris/plaque. I was extremely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I finally ordered it here online because I cannot easily find it locally anymore.  If you can&#x27;t use regular, thin floss because it shreds, then you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
    <li> My favorite dental TAPE although it&#x27;s getting so thin that pretty soon they won&#x27;t be able to call it tape.  The floss always goes to quickly through my teeth and ends up cutting up my gums.  The tape is thicker and helps prevent that.</li>
    <li> So great to have the hard to find dental tape again. My husband laughed when they all arrived but is happily using them daily too!</li>
    <li> Product is as described.  Nothing much else can be said.</li>
    <li> Very good deal,can&#x27;t find this product locally. price very good</li>
