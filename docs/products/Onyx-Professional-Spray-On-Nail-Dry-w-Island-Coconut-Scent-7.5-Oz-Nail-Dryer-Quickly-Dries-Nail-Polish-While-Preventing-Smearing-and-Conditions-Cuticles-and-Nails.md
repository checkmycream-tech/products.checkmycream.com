      <li>spray on nail dry is really the solution to this problem.</li>
      <li>do paint my toenails more often, however, half of the time I run into things walking around the house because once again, I simply can&#x27;t sit still long enough for the polish to dry.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Every other nail drying spray I&#x27;ve purchased has smelled disgusting, I love that this one actually smells good!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t paint my fingernails very often because I&#x27;m not patient enough for them to dry.</li>
      <li>The paint is also shinier, so the polish does not dull / get dusty as quickly.</li>

    <li> I smells good &amp; surprisingly it works.  Don&#x27;t spray to close to your fingers or the pressure will warp your polish.</li>
    <li> Could be cheaper, but otherwise, very pleased. I use it often and hope it will last a long time. Smell is okay (coconut) as others have stated. I do 2 quick spray layers and my nails are dry enough to do things in 5 minutes and the paint is strong / does not chip as much. The paint is also shinier, so the polish does not dull / get dusty as quickly. I usually paint my nails outside as I&#x27;m sure whatever is in this is not good for me, but it works. Other people noted that spraying between coats didn&#x27;t work for them, but it seems fine to me if you just wait until the first coat dries completely. I generally only need one coat though unless I&#x27;m painting a pattern.&lt;br /&gt;-- I also keep the can in a plastic bin and it is laying down and it does not drip or leak, which I definitely appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;Will likely purchase again once I run out. I make a mess of my nails because I&#x27;m impatient and this has helped me in this way!</li>
    <li> Works great and has a rly nice smell to it</li>
    <li> It works very quickly and smells pretty good .. I am ordering another can for sure</li>
    <li> It was unbelievable.  I was ready to move in a very short time without any smudge or repair concerns aboiut my nails.  That&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;special!</li>
    <li> Works very well. Dries nails very fast as described. Also, it smells good!</li>

    <li> Quick drying, hard, hard shell for regular polish.  I always think my polish is dry and then boom, my keys or my purse or something hits it hard enough to smear a piece.  This spray fixed all that.</li>
    <li> Made spots on my nails</li>

    <li> I don&#x27;t paint my fingernails very often because I&#x27;m not patient enough for them to dry. I always have to be doing something and end up ruining them so if I have the patience I will re-paint them, if not, I will remove it and pretend it never happened.&lt;br /&gt;I do paint my toenails more often, however, half of the time I run into things walking around the house because once again, I simply can&#x27;t sit still long enough for the polish to dry.&lt;br /&gt;This spray on nail dry is really the solution to this problem. I don&#x27;t have to worry about running into things because my polish will be dry by the time I walk out of the bathroom! I didn&#x27;t even notice when I bought it that it was scented, but that&#x27;s also nice because it doesn&#x27;t smell like chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;It really doesn&#x27;t require more than one quick spray over your hand/foot to dry the polish so this giant bottle will likely last me a year or more.&lt;br /&gt;I can have cute nails and be productive all at the same time! Hallelujah!</li>
    <li> Works great.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great nail drying product with a nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> Just a small amount will keep your nails from smudging and smearing... works GREAT!! I definitely recommend it!! I will order a few more cans to have!</li>
    <li> dries fast and smells fabulous.</li>
    <li> coconut smell great and works good</li>
    <li> Very impressed.  I didn&#x27;t expect this to dry as well or as quickly as it does.  I did two light coats, the first left my nails a bit sticky yet but an immediate second coat had them perfect.  Decent smell if you like coconut and didn&#x27;t leave the rest of my skin greasy like I was afraid of.  I&#x27;ll definitely buy again but I expect this one to last a while.</li>
    <li> Every other nail drying spray I&#x27;ve purchased has smelled disgusting, I love that this one actually smells good! It seems to help drying time a little bit as well..</li>
    <li> Works great. Once the polish is a little tachy, I just spray a little on and within seconds its hard and dry.</li>
