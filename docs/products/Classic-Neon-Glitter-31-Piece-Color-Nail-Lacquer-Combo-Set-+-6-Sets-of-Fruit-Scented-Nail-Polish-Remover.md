      <li>Totally worth the buy!!</li>
      <li>they are vibrant and great FULL SIZE quality.</li>
      <li>The variety of colors is fantastic and the glitter is FUN!!</li>
      <li>but I feel that it&#x27;s still worth it since I got a pretty good selection.</li>
      <li>This is a great gift for a teen!  </li>
      <li>it is really worth it. &#x3D;]</li>
      <li>but I that doesn&#x27;t bear any weight on the review of the nail polish because for the money the pads are just a bonus - the colors are very worth it.</li>
      <li>It was also exciting to unwrap each nail polish and reveal the colors!</li>
      <li>originally gave this item 4 stars, but had to lower it to 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The polish chips after one day of use...</li>
      <li>she was very happy,and she kept talking about it and how much she love it,very nice gift to give or keep...</li>
      <li>It works great and doesn&#x27;t smell bad which is the best part!</li>
      <li>Better then I expected, exceptional value.</li>
      <li>It was such a great variety and there was more than enough different colors to make all the girls happy.  </li>
      <li>The polish is medium thick which is excellent for doing art on my nails.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a great variety of colors excluding white and clear.   </li>
      <li>The colors were not all as shown, but I was not unhappy with what I did recieve.</li>
      <li>Most polish just peel right off my fingers especially the cheap polish.</li>
      <li>Yes the colors are a great variety, but unfortunately they just chip super easily.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about this brand, but my daughter assured me that she had bought a few and was okay with it.</li>
      <li>but I prefer it to the other kind.</li>
      <li>Quality seems as good as more expensive brands I have used.</li>
      <li>many pinks and several shades that were very close).&lt;br</li>
      <li>I work with my hands (which includes washing my hands many times throughout the day), so no nail polish - even OPI with a clear coat lasts more than a few days without chipping.</li>
      <li>I gave it 4 stars because you can&#x27;t really beat the price . . .</li>
      <li>Items arrived on time and packaged very well.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t really mind.</li>
      <li>Also, I did not receive the l.a colors nail polish remover pads in fruit scents but the same nail polish brand in FLOWER SCENTS such as rose and gardenia, ect.</li>
      <li>The second issue is that my lady has recently said that the nail polish comes off too easily and quickly.</li>
      <li>I enjoyed that the nail polishes were individually wrapped, which showed me that the company actually cares that the product will arrive unharmed.</li>
      <li>This polish is decent quality.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re very professional and for the price it is a steal!</li>
      <li>I received a variety of colors, no duplicates, and even received white and black, which I was very pleased to see.  </li>
      <li>Not like normal nail polishes</li>
      <li>and she wanted to do a new color with the new rhinestones.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tested a few of the nail polishes and none of them are dried out; all of them are in great condition.  </li>
      <li>which is GREAT, they look so much nicer (in white, silver and black little tubs rather than the ones</li>
      <li>I will be ordering more for other teens in the future.</li>
      <li>I was very surprised by how quickly this was shipped, and how carefully.  </li>
      <li>Im not sure if I got exactly the SPECIFIC colors listed,but,the colors are fantastic regardless, really.</li>
      <li>I got about half of the colors listed and the rest were different, mostly pinks(so</li>
      <li>I received as a gift, colors noted were not what I received, 4 bottles were just clear coat.</li>
      <li>Shipping was really fast too it only took 2 days to be delivered</li>
      <li>The colors were the ones young girls are currenly wearing.  </li>
      <li>The product was shipped very carefully-each individual nail polish had a mesh type of covering</li>
      <li>I realize it&#x27;s surely from non-use, but it rendered them totally useless, thus making this less of a deal since I can&#x27;t use a huge portion of them and just had to toss them.</li>
      <li>I received all 31 bottles,packed in groups of 6 with plastic netting around each bottle and in a clear box, with #31 wrapped individually in bubble wrap.</li>
      <li>a couple fragrances were not super appetizing)</li>
      <li>The remover pads are pretty greasy and it takes a few to get the polish totally off</li>
      <li>It usually lasts me a week which is a decent amount of time as far as nail polish goes.   </li>

    <li> I bought this polish set so my daughter and I could have some time together do each others nails, she&#x27;s 9. I didnt want her in my OPI polish and figured this was a great deal for the price. Most polish just peel right off my fingers especially the cheap polish. This polish did not it lasted for almost a week and I&#x27;m confident it wouldve lasted longer but my daughter wanted to nails again since the nail art we&#x27;d ordered came in and she wanted to do a new color with the new rhinestones. I&#x27;d say for our &#x27;play time&#x27; aka mother daughter time this polish is great, the polish remover is pretty good too, it has oil in it so your skin isnt dried out as you&#x27;re taking polish off. I do wish it it had white included. This should last us for quite some time. Shipping was really fast too it only took 2 days to be delivered and I order pretty late in the day.</li>
    <li> This is a great gift for a teen!  I ordered it for Christmas and when it hadn&#x27;t arrived when scheduled I contacted the seller.  Item was priority shipped and received within two days.  The polish bottles were full-size and not samples.  The colors were the ones young girls are currenly wearing.  Add to that the price was great!  There were lots of oohs and aahs when opened.  I will be ordering more for other teens in the future.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this brand, but my daughter assured me that she had bought a few and was okay with it. I was quiet surprized with it. The colors were not all as shown, but I was not unhappy with what I did recieve. Quality seems as good as more expensive brands I have used. Can&#x27;t go wrong for the price. I was very impressed with the packaging, some sort of strong netting was secured around each bottle and packed between bubble wrap, not one bottle was damaged, and netting was easily removed. Would recommed and will by again.</li>
    <li> I received as a gift, colors noted were not what I received, 4 bottles were just clear coat. No glitters or golds. At least none were broken.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love everything about this set! It&#x27;s by kleancolor and majority of the colors shown aren&#x27;t the one&#x27;s you&#x27;ll receive but I feel that it&#x27;s still worth it since I got a pretty good selection. The remover pads are pretty greasy and it takes a few to get the polish totally off but they were just a bonus so I don&#x27;t really mind. I&#x27;m almost tempted to purchase again if I knew I wouldn&#x27;t get repeats. Totally worth the buy!!</li>
    <li> I gave it 4 stars because you can&#x27;t really beat the price . . . when I bought it, it was around $1 per color, which seemed fantastic, and the polish removers were an added bonus! (And they work well and smell good too)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d have given it 5, but several of the bottles eventually froze shut - no amount of force will get them open. I realize it&#x27;s surely from non-use, but it rendered them totally useless, thus making this less of a deal since I can&#x27;t use a huge portion of them and just had to toss them.</li>
    <li> This many full size nail polishes for the price is an amazing deal!  I love the variety of colors and the glitter polishes.  The polish is medium thick which is excellent for doing art on my nails.  The seller also shipped the product quickly and packed it very nicely so none of the bottles would break.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m putting together gift bags for a bridal shower and ended up needing to buy alot of bottles of nail polish. I bought this stuff because of the price and the variety of colors, but after trying out a bottle I found that is good quality stuff, worthy of a greater price.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and as described. There was a wide variety of color and glitter nail polish. I enjoyed that the nail polishes were individually wrapped, which showed me that the company actually cares that the product will arrive unharmed. It was also exciting to unwrap each nail polish and reveal the colors! I had the nail polish on over 3 days before it began to crack and 5 days after painting them only 3 fingers have cracks in the nail polish. The nail polish removers smell like the fruit (a couple fragrances were not super appetizing) but I did notice that they do leave your fingers greasy feeling. However, they were an added bonus so I&#x27;m not complaining! Overall, I would definitely buy from MissPinkCat again!</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a great value. I work with my hands (which includes washing my hands many times throughout the day), so no nail polish - even OPI with a clear coat lasts more than a few days without chipping. So, I know the problem is me. This polish is decent quality. It lasted a couple days for me, which is good. The variety of colors is fantastic and the glitter is FUN!! The fruit-scented nail polish remover pads seem very oily to me and the scent is very unpleasant but I that doesn&#x27;t bear any weight on the review of the nail polish because for the money the pads are just a bonus - the colors are very worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought these as a gift. I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the packaging and the colors. I know my friend is going to love them! :)</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend for Christmas (along with the m.a.s.h nail art confetti) and I must say I was pretty shocked with both the packaging, quantity and appearance of the product. I received all 31 bottles,packed in groups of 6 with plastic netting around each bottle and in a clear box, with #31 wrapped individually in bubble wrap. (the box also had a load of bubble wrap and foam nuggets (idk what to call them lol) and was labeled \\&quot;glass\\&quot; by the seller, def. ensured nothing would be broken. Im not sure if I got exactly the SPECIFIC colors listed,but,the colors are fantastic regardless, really. they are vibrant and great FULL SIZE quality. Also, I did not receive the l.a colors nail polish remover pads in fruit scents but the same nail polish brand in FLOWER SCENTS such as rose and gardenia, ect. which is GREAT, they look so much nicer (in white, silver and black little tubs rather than the ones shown.)All in all, great buy! And I will def. be ordering again!!! &#x3D;D though shipping did take a bit long, (product was from cali, im in wine country NY lol) it is really worth it. &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> One bottle had sort of broken when I got it, but the bottles came in the colors that are in the description. I just wish there were more variety of the colors. there&#x27;s like 10 bottles that are just sparkles and if it were up to me I would have chosen colors over sparkles. Oh well. The scented nail polish remover things are nice too.</li>
    <li> This is a good set of nail polish. The packing was great they came in a bow and eat bottle was wrapped individually. The only reason I am giving it a four is because they all have a very odd smell. Not like normal nail polishes but it goes away after they dry.</li>
    <li> I purchased this set to give to my baton twirlers for part of their Christmas gift.  It was such a great variety and there was more than enough different colors to make all the girls happy.  The product was shipped very carefully-each individual nail polish had a mesh type of covering so I didn&#x27;t have any broken bottles.  I am very happy with this purchase and would definately reommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> Purchased the product for my lady. Items arrived on time and packaged very well. Everything that was described was in the package but here are the issues. It was supposed to come with 6 different scented nail polish removers There was 6 but 2 diferent scents lemon and grape. The image that they posted shows 6 different scents, so that was a let down. The second issue is that my lady has recently said that the nail polish comes off too easily and quickly. I don&#x27;t use nail polish so I&#x27;m going by what she told me. She was very happy to get the gift but we&#x27;ll see the more she uses it.</li>
    <li> I was not sure what to expect from this product since I did not know the brand name and was nervous that I had wasted my money on really crappy nail polish but went for it based on the previous reviews.   The nail polish was well packaged so that none of the bottles were broken. The quality of the nail polish isn&#x27;t bad. It usually lasts me a week which is a decent amount of time as far as nail polish goes.   There&#x27;s a great variety of colors excluding white and clear.   The nail polish remover is great. It&#x27;s a little greasy but I prefer it to the other kind. It works great and doesn&#x27;t smell bad which is the best part!</li>
    <li> I purchased these nail polishes and was very pleased at how quickly i received them. I was NOT please when i painted my nails and the nail polish peeled off within the hour!! I will not be purchasing this brand again.</li>
    <li> colors are nice. some are neon, some are pastels and some  with glitter. just do not buy from this seller (miss pink cat). if you have a problem with your order even if seller is at fought, they do not attempt to resolve the issue, or maybe you will have better luck. but the polish colors are really nice.</li>
    <li> Updated review*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally gave this item 4 stars, but had to lower it to 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The polish chips after one day of use... no bueno!! Yes the colors are a great variety, but unfortunately they just chip super easily.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my girlfriend and she love&#x27;s them just wish there would of been more glitter ones in the set .</li>
    <li> I ordered these thinking I&#x27;d be getting the colors pictured and in the description. I chose this set over others because it seemed to have many darker shades, which I like best. I got about half of the colors listed and the rest were different, mostly pinks(so many pinks and several shades that were very close).&lt;br /&gt;The nail polish itself is a great brand and this is a great deal for the amount of polishes you get.&lt;br /&gt;The nail polish removers also work great and will be a must for me to buy whenever I finish them.&lt;br /&gt;I would have enjoyed this purchase more had I known not to expect the colors listed.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised by how quickly this was shipped, and how carefully.  Each individual nail polish bottle was wrapped in a protective netting to keep the glass from clinking together and potentially cracking during shipment.  I received a variety of colors, no duplicates, and even received white and black, which I was very pleased to see.  I&#x27;ve tested a few of the nail polishes and none of them are dried out; all of them are in great condition.  Would buy from this seller again in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> this was also a gift i give to my daughter during the christmas holiday she was very happy,and she kept talking about it and how much she love it,very nice gift to give or keep...</li>
    <li> I am so happy that I got these colors and these polishes for my daughter and there&#x27;s a huge variety they are long-lasting  they are beautiful, bright, vibrant, and go on well. They&#x27;re very professional and for the price it is a steal! I would definitely definitely buy this set again. Better then pictured. Better then I expected, exceptional value.</li>
