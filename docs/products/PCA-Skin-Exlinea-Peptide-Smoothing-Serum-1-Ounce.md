      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this serum for the first time for about 2 weeks now.</li>
      <li>I have spent so much money on products that don&#x27;t do what they say, so I am thrilled to have found this.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product I have seen a change in mu pores and general look of my skin after two weeks of use.</li>

      <li>They direct you about how to use it on the back of the bottle.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t understand how or why it works so well, but I use it twice a day without fail and I am loving what it is doing.</li>
      <li>I have numerous allergies and dry skin, along with the normal wear and tear for an old lady.  </li>
      <li>I had tried a few other products to help reduce some of the fine lines around my eyes and cheeks</li>
      <li>I think it really helps to make lines around those areas less noticeable.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this serum every morning and evening under day or night cream. This is my second purchase of this serum because I love it! My forehead wrinkle is almost completely gone! My overall complexion is better and pores look smaller. It is awesome!</li>
    <li> Does what says.  Great for aging skin, someone in their late 30&#x27;s/early 40&#x27;s.  Make sure is applied to clean face and best if used with toner first.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 68 years old. PCA Exlinea has definely reduced both fine lines and deep wrinkles. My skin is quite dry. Exlinea helps hold moisture in the skin.  At night I also put it on my lips. They were dry looking. Now they are slightly fuller and have even a pinker color. I&#x27;m on my 3 month of use. I got results in about a week.</li>
    <li> This is one product that I just don&#x27;t think I will ever do without. My esthetician gave me a sample of this (but it was enough to last for a few weeks). I noticed improvement in my skin- and I&#x27;m not even kidding- from the very first application. I have spent so much money on products that don&#x27;t do what they say, so I am thrilled to have found this. I don&#x27;t have drastic lines yet (but I can feel them waiting in the shadows!) but this product made a dramatic difference anyway. My little forehead &amp;#34;11&amp;#34; lines are barely noticeable as long as I use Exlinea. It has improved the look of lines around my eyes and those marionette lines from smiling too much (happy life equals wrinkles apparently. Bah!)&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand how or why it works so well, but I use it twice a day without fail and I am loving what it is doing. I highly recommend this product. Also, I was nervous to order online at first but my Exlinea was clearly legit and was sealed and marked clearly with an expiration date well in the future. So, this time it was a total success. I will absolutely order more. Instead of paying money for other products, I&#x27;ll just spend more on this one because it works.</li>
    <li> This does not even compare with the Victoria Deeann line. This was less expensive so I thought I would try… Overall disappointed</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks.  It works okay, but I like the TNS Essential Serum better.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product I have seen a change in mu pores and general look of my skin after two weeks of use. Will purchase againg</li>
    <li> This is a great serum for lines and around the eyes too</li>
    <li> Regular product that I love and a go to for smoothing serum.</li>
    <li> Helps skin look smoother and feels smoother too!</li>
    <li> I apply this after cleansing and using my PCA toner and PCA A&amp;C serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gives a slight dewy appearance to my face and does seem to diminish the look of fine lines.  Once it has soaked it, I find that it also works are a pretty good primer under my makeup.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good. I have been using this line for for many years and have enjoyed the results that I have gotten with my skin. I would recommend this product to all women especially for us older ladies.</li>
    <li> Love all the PCA products I have purchased!  I can see a difference within a few weeks of starting to use it.  The prices seem to have gone up on some products since my last purchase.  A bit pricey.</li>
    <li> The seller gets 5 stars.  I&#x27;m not having better results with this than any other smoothing serum or anti-aging product.  I have numerous allergies and dry skin, along with the normal wear and tear for an old lady.  If you&#x27;re susceptible to fever blisters on your face, have trouble being in the sun for any period of time, or have sensitive skin this and other products may aggravate those conditions.  I have found that when using ANY product on my face I can&#x27;t cover my entire face with the product.  This includes lotions, powders, toners, soaps, facial masks, and sun screens.</li>
    <li> Great product and good price. Recommended by a skincare specialist it is good to keep lines from getting worse or helping to prevent them. I paid too much before finding it on line and got a much better price for this.&lt;br /&gt;Shipment on time as well.</li>
    <li> I love the results I am seeing with this product, will be ordering more!! I would highly recommend this product to anyone, my fine lines are disappearing...yeah!!</li>
    <li> Bought them on advice of my cosmetologist from her.  Paid much more as far as I remember.  Never thought I could find the same on Amazon.  Now I  am glad it suddenly came to my mind to check  this site.</li>
    <li> This product (PCA Skin Exlinea Peptide Smoothing Serum) is awesome. Wash your face, tone it and put the skin exlinea and you can feel your skin getting tight then moisturizer or sunscreen</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used PCA skin products for a few years now.  This product is one of my favorites.  I only use it around the eye/upper lip area so it lasts a very long time for me.  I think it really helps to make lines around those areas less noticeable.</li>
    <li> Love PCA - just the extra boost my skin needed for the cooler dry AZ winter.  Great addition to my skin care regimine.</li>
    <li> PCA is the best! This product smooths lines. I use it every morning for younger look. I have been told that I look 10-15 years younger than my age</li>
    <li> I love this serum for my face.</li>
    <li> Great skin care! My Dr. Uses this line as well. I have several products.I&lt;br /&gt;Recommend  PAC skincare highly. They direct you about how to use it on the back of the bottle.</li>
    <li> I had tried a few other products to help reduce some of the fine lines around my eyes and cheeks but this is the first one that really seemed to help. Recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I feel differnce in 1 week .&lt;br /&gt;First I use it because one doctor suggest me.&lt;br /&gt;and I love it.</li>
    <li> I liked this product so much that I reordered.  And that&#x27;s something I very rarely do.  My skin is smooth and bright.</li>
    <li> I noticed that I look younger, just wonder why...?  I bought this Serum 2 weeks ago, and am using this twice a day.  This must be it!  I do not need botox....?</li>
    <li> I love this product and use it every morning before my daily moisturiszer. It is light weight and absorbs quickly. I like to believe it prevents wrinkles. My skin looks great. But it is a beauty product and no miracle. Regardless I really like it and have been using it for a long time.</li>
    <li> This was actually shipped to me in error earlier this year.  I was told not to return it so I tried it, as I have been searching for a good wrinkle reducer for some time.  I really like the way it works, I use it at night.  I don&#x27;t expect to look like I&#x27;m 20 again, but I do believe that it is helping me from looking any older (some people even say that I don&#x27;t look my age)!</li>
    <li> exlinea is a wonderful product!!! Very easy to use and works well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for awhile &amp; like its effect on my skin. As a professional esthetician, I was surprised to find it here for even less than my pro rate! I&#x27;d definitely purchase it from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Im 57 yrs. old. I&#x27;ve had wonderful results w/ this Serum.&lt;br /&gt;I have no under eye wrinkling or puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;I see a difference when I use this product.&lt;br /&gt;W/o it I develope fine lines under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it highly and Amazon has best price and service.</li>
    <li> Noticed a difference in eye areas very quickly........very unusual for me.</li>
    <li> I love this brand and I love the packaging. The pump gives you just enough for one application - no waste! It&#x27;s reasonably priced too.&lt;br /&gt;I will be reordering.</li>
    <li> Liquid gold. Amazon has the best price too. I would give up every skin care product I own before I&#x27;d give this stuff up. Prevents wrinkles and treats them. I&#x27;m 48 yrs old and can pass for 35.</li>
    <li> I use this serum after I have cleansed my skin. It is light and non-greasy. It softens  my skin. Afterwards I use a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for a few years. It has helped to minimize the fine wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for the first time for about 2 weeks now. It has a wonderful clean smell. I use it after PCA creamy cleanser and PCA purifying toner. I use several other pca products as well. this is a nice addition to my am and pm routine.I am not sure it is any better than any other anti-aging product though, but I give it 5 stars because I am pleased with this line and this serum feels wonderful on my skin without drying it out. I am 43.</li>
    <li> No noticable results after 2 bottles, not going to get it again. Nerium is much better.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Much less expensive than my dermatologists office.  I like all of the PCA products but especially the ones with Peptide in them.  I am allergic to many products including prescription face creams.  However, this product has not caused any allergic reactions.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Worked miracles on my forehead and under my eyes. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> As with all PCA my skin is smooth and glowing. I mix one pump of Total Strength and 1 pump of exlinea and all over my face and neck are requires extra pump of both. Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> This is expensive but very good. I did not think that a serum would change the lines but it helps!</li>
    <li> Used product for two years &amp; definitely see improvement in skin texture &amp; it works to keep skin from aging. I highly recommend. Very happy with results. A+</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because I&#x27;ve used this product for over 2 years.  I discovered buying it through Amazon was more cost effective than from my physician.  I would recommend this product to women who want a skin treatment that goes below the skin surface.</li>
