      <li>Great Product, fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I could have saved more buying just cleaning rags.  </li>
      <li>these are more than I hoped for</li>
      <li>I love to cook and</li>
      <li>and of course had a better smell...</li>
      <li>Need I say more?</li>
      <li>Glad I made this purchase.</li>
      <li>and they were fine.  </li>
      <li>Honestly, I could care less - they work great for what I need them for, but if you&#x27;re looking for the sort of thing you&#x27;d want wrapped around your neck in a spa/getting a massage/etc</li>
      <li>I bought these because I go through a lot of gym towels, and I needed something cheap.  </li>
      <li>These were indeed cheap</li>
      <li>These towels are cheaply made.  </li>
      <li>- I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the best price on Amazon for small towels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not bad but lots of lint on 1st washing</li>
      <li>These filled the bill and the price was right.  </li>
      <li>Quick ship.</li>
      <li>They also had a chemical type of smell, but after I washed it luckily the smell was gone.  </li>
      <li>I guess i should have noticed that since they are pretty cheap.  </li>
      <li>Work for exactly what I need them for... salon towels!  </li>
      <li>Love how soft they are after you wash them.</li>
      <li>The towels are not even remotely soft, they&#x27;re more of rags than towels.  </li>
      <li>After the first wash these started to unravel.</li>
      <li>These fell apart after the first wash.</li>
      <li>You really get what you pay for!</li>
      <li>Exactly had described.</li>
      <li>After first wash some edges frayed and shredded.  </li>
      <li>The towels are just as i expected, i use them for my clients as a warm compress after a massage.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a quick way for him to keep dry and clean and then pop them in the washer.</li>
      <li>but I was still very surprise at how large these are even after washing them.  </li>
      <li>Came out better than I expected.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>The towels are nice and heavy.</li>
      <li>The quality of the towel is fine, they are just not soft.</li>
      <li>and so I bought these hoping for something a little better.</li>
      <li>The towels are not white, more like a yellowish grey.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I will be having to buy new towels in a few months and will not be buying these again.</li>
      <li>they do not stay hot for very long when heated in a hot cabi</li>
      <li>Lint free (some other store towels leave</li>
      <li>Needed new cleaning towels that I could toss if ruined.</li>
      <li>I like  this product, the towels are light weight and absorb well, much easier to use than heavy plush sheared ones..</li>
      <li>Also, they arrived earlier than expected :)</li>
      <li>The towels I had been using before were pretty low quality</li>
      <li>The towels are working as i need them to during massages; however they are more rough than soft and are freying already around edges after washing several times.</li>
      <li>I am not expecting super soft luxury towels, but these things are rough.</li>
      <li>Light to medium weight, not real plush, but do the trick for basic salon use.  </li>
      <li>Replaced my old worn, torn, darkened ones.</li>
      <li>I gave them 2 stars instead of one because they are soft despite all the shedding.</li>
      <li>These towels are a dull offwhite color, poorly made (the seams are not straight), and many lack any kind of label regarding content or country of manufacture.  </li>
      <li>Very cheap and thin material.</li>
      <li>For the price, they were worth the little bit of maintenance.</li>
      <li>Took several washings to make semi soft.</li>
      <li>They are super thin and really scratchy.</li>
      <li>Before using the towels, I stuck them in the washer for the first time and half of them came out frayed!  </li>
      <li>WOW, I was really disappointed after reading so many positive reviews and making this purchase.  </li>

    <li> Very rough and scratchy</li>
    <li> Nice stuff for the price</li>
    <li> very thin towels  they do not stay hot for very long when heated in a hot cabi</li>
    <li> These towels are a dull offwhite color, poorly made (the seams are not straight), and many lack any kind of label regarding content or country of manufacture.  One had a torn label that just said &amp;#34;Made in.&amp;#34;  I was surprised to come across such a poor quality product on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Thin and scratchy. Took several washings to make semi soft.</li>
    <li> great value!!  I love to cook and throwing a towel over my left shoulder is a thing I do- these are more than I hoped for</li>
    <li> A bit scratchy, but you get what you pay for. Quality and quantity are what I expected for the price.</li>
    <li> Love how soft they are after you wash them.</li>
    <li> Very good towels was as described. Used in hair salon for drying hair works great don&#x27;t fray. Good item recommend.</li>
    <li> Hard, but I used on my clients head, to set castor oil before installing extensions</li>
    <li> is not 100% cotton, choose another product!!</li>
    <li> These towels are cheaply made.  I guess i should have noticed that since they are pretty cheap.  After the first wash these started to unravel.</li>
    <li> We bought these towels for a &amp;#34;Mother&#x27;s Day Spa&amp;#34; event at our preschool...they served the purpose well.  I did wash them beforehand, and three of the towels frayed around the edges quite a bit.  I trimmed them and we still used them and they were fine.  For the price, they were worth the little bit of maintenance.</li>
    <li> But they sure do smell bad! I returned them.</li>
    <li> The towels are working as i need them to during massages; however they are more rough than soft and are freying already around edges after washing several times. The towels are serving their purpose but are not the quality i thought them to be.</li>
    <li> These towels are the worst! After washing and drying a couple of times they still leave white fuzz on everything! Thank goodness I only bought them for the gym... But still it&#x27;s beyond annoying to have all my gym clothes covered in fuzz. I gave them 2 stars instead of one because they are soft despite all the shedding.</li>
    <li> Very nice size and quality. Lint free (some other store towels leave residue)...it&#x27;s bigger than a hand towel and much smaller than a bath towel. Great for the gym.</li>
    <li> The description says &amp;#34;Salon Towels&amp;#34; but these were the same texture as cleaning towels.  I could have saved more buying just cleaning rags.  They also had a chemical type of smell, but after I washed it luckily the smell was gone.  However, two of the 24 towels that I ordered have already frayed along the edge after just this one wash without even using it!  I&#x27;m sure I will be having to buy new towels in a few months and will not be buying these again.</li>
    <li> Needed new cleaning towels that I could toss if ruined. These washed and wear nicely, larger, absorbent, fold well. No iron. Came out better than I expected. Replaced my old worn, torn, darkened ones.</li>
    <li> The towels are scratchy and at least 3 of them, the threads pulled out after one washing!  I will not buy these towels again!  You really get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> Light to medium weight, not real plush, but do the trick for basic salon use.  Would not recommend for use as hair wash towels.</li>
    <li> I am not expecting super soft luxury towels, but these things are rough. I have purchased other towels at a similar price and they were softer. The quality of the towel is fine, they are just not soft.</li>
    <li> I love these towels, they are perfect in size. The towels are just as i expected, i use them for my clients as a warm compress after a massage.&lt;br /&gt; Also, they arrived earlier than expected :)</li>
    <li> Very poor quality.  We couldn&#x27;t use them in our motel rooms so had to send them back.</li>
    <li> The description says these are great quality and everyone was ranting, but for salon use these are not great quality at all. They are super thin and really scratchy. The towels I had been using before were pretty low quality and so I bought these hoping for something a little better. It turns out they were worse. I won&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
    <li> I saw the measurements but I was still very surprise at how large these are even after washing them.  The towels are nice and heavy. Very impressed.</li>
    <li> Purchased these for my massage practice and washed them all by themselves.  They look and feel great!  I look forward to using them in my therapeutic sessions.</li>
    <li> Perfect for kitchen clean ups...</li>
    <li> I like  this product, the towels are light weight and absorb well, much easier to use than heavy plush sheared ones..</li>
    <li> Sheets described as white?  They were grey - even after two washes.  After first wash some edges frayed and shredded.  Product sucks!</li>
    <li> Good towels for cleaning!  We were looking for towels to hang as handtowels in our clinic bathroom and to use covers for our treatment table facial support.  These are good quality, but not of the design for our intended purposes.  Appreciate the sellers prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I go through a lot of gym towels, and I needed something cheap.  I&#x27;m someone who doesn&#x27;t always know where his towel is :(  These were indeed cheap - I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the best price on Amazon for small towels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, they&#x27;re pretty rough and mediocre quality.  As someone else mentioned, they do have a plastic smell out of the bag, but it goes away on washing.  Honestly, I could care less - they work great for what I need them for, but if you&#x27;re looking for the sort of thing you&#x27;d want wrapped around your neck in a spa/getting a massage/etc, I&#x27;d look somewhere else.</li>
    <li> These towels seemed very thin and had an unpleasant smell when they arrived; but, I washed them and they seemed to fluff up and of course had a better smell...still not as thick as I like them.</li>
    <li> Exactly had described. Quick ship. Good value</li>
    <li> Towels are fairly thin but I expected that (I&#x27;m buying this to mop up floor).  Item arrived in timely manner and the price is good.</li>
    <li> Great quality towels. Feels great on my clients face as a steamed towel! On time delivery. Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> The towels are not white, more like a yellowish grey. We bought them for our massage therapist to use and they look dirty.</li>
    <li> affordable but very poor quality and discoloured and frayed  on first wash.</li>
    <li> Great buy cheaper than the beauty store great quality perfect for state board cosmetology exam</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, good quality.</li>
    <li> I returned these towels because I felt the quality was inferior for an upscale spa.</li>
    <li> These fell apart after the first wash. Very cheap and thin material. They work as rags now.</li>
    <li> So so so so soft and perfect for my daughter who will be using them in her line of work!</li>
    <li> Not bad but lots of lint on 1st washing</li>
    <li> Beauty Shop Quality. But great price for a a bunch of towels. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> We purchased these hand towels for my husband to use while working our property.  It&#x27;s a quick way for him to keep dry and clean and then pop them in the washer.</li>
    <li> WOW, I was really disappointed after reading so many positive reviews and making this purchase.  Before using the towels, I stuck them in the washer for the first time and half of them came out frayed!  The towels are not even remotely soft, they&#x27;re more of rags than towels.  My intention was to use them as gym towels, but looks like they&#x27;ll be used for general cleaning / dirty work in the garage.</li>
    <li> A little rougher than I thought but maybe they will soften up with use and washing.</li>
    <li> Great Product, fast shipping. Need I say more?</li>
    <li> great towels ....would buy again! Thank You!</li>
    <li> AFTER WASHING A COUPLE OF TIME THEY STARTED TO FRAY</li>
    <li> I needed a good number of gym towels for my husband, so he would quit using hand towels and re-using them many times.  They didn&#x27;t need to be fancy, just basic terry cloth towels.  These filled the bill and the price was right.  With a dozen, the used ones get washed before he is even close to the end of the stack.</li>
    <li> Perfect!  Work for exactly what I need them for... salon towels!  Glad I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> On what planet would these be considered Egyptian Cotton? They&#x27;re rough as sand paper. Guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> These are very thin - but then they weren&#x27;t expensive so I wasn&#x27;t expecting more. They are perfect for a sweat towel or shop towel or what I&#x27;m using them for - whelping puppies. I wouldn&#x27;t use them for guests or in my bathroom.</li>
