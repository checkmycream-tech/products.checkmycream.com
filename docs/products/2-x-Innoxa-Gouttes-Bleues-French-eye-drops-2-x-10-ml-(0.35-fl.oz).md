### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>For me, the best eye drops on the market for the price.</li>
      <li>The best eye drops.</li>
      <li>Use all the time, very good</li>
      <li>Great for clearing your eyes of redness and irritation.  </li>
      <li>Have not been able to get these drops in Canada, so was very happy to be able to order them online.</li>
      <li>I got these drops and they have been amazing.</li>
      <li>and this has helped my eyes feel more hydrated as well as improving how they look.</li>
      <li>Better than drugstore products.  </li>
      <li>It is pkg&#x27;d nicely and the color in glass bottle is pretty, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
      <li>Did not notice a change, though they do feel good as in a normal eye drops.</li>
      <li>I love these drops, the whites of my eyes are much clearer.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use - don&#x27;t need much.</li>
      <li>and they are getting red very easy.</li>
      <li>The dropper tip is soft grip and easy to control.</li>
      <li>After the first week, I didn&#x27;t need to use it every day.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While it feels pleasant on the eye(doesn&#x27;t burn like a Visine product), it appears to do very little where brightening is concerned.  </li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Who&#x27;s to really know while purchasing something on Amazon Prime....</li>
      <li>Usually available only in Europe.</li>
      <li>My eyes are so alive &amp; vibrant &amp; vision better than expected!</li>
      <li>I really think it makes the blue and white parts of my eyes brighter and more clear.</li>
      <li>These eye drops are okay, but did not make my eyes as white as I expected like the whites of the eyes on the tv stars</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive eyes</li>
      <li>I use them every 2 - 3 days once a day and my eyes are now clear after one month.</li>
      <li>This product has really worked for me, eyes are whiter and brighter and has taken out the yellow in my eye whites.</li>
      <li>This product really works for my blue eyes.</li>
      <li>So really it got some red out but</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like the blue that stained my clothes and anything near that some drops hit.</li>
      <li>Back in the early 90&#x27;s there was a product I got from St. Barths.</li>
      <li>I had Lazik Eye Surgery over 3months ago &amp; these are the only drops that really have helped with my dry eyes!</li>
      <li>I live in Colorado where it&#x27;s very dry</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m all for an easy, relatively inexpensive product that works well, lasts awhile and makes a dramatic improvement in appearance without surgery.</li>

    <li> Great for clearing your eyes of redness and irritation.  Usually available only in Europe.</li>
    <li> Not much of a difference for me. Stains linens.</li>
    <li> Did not notice a change, though they do feel good as in a normal eye drops.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product. I have very sensitive eyes and they are getting red very easy. I bought this product and it is not cheap because others regular pharmacy drops are not helping. This drops didn&#x27;t do anything when I used them. Very unhappy with it.</li>
    <li> This product really works for my blue eyes. Gets rid of the red from tiredness or overuse of computer. Better than drugstore products.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I am 43 and have noticed little red capillaries all over inside my eyes and some white mucus starting to form in the inner corners. I wanted my eyes to look clearer and younger. I got these drops and they have been amazing. I use them every 2 - 3 days once a day and my eyes are now clear after one month. No more red veins and no more mucus in the inner corner. The drop itself is blue so you can see it in the eye or if it rolls out. It&#x27;s easy to use - don&#x27;t need much. I use a little half drop in each eye. The dropper tip is soft grip and easy to control. After the first week, I didn&#x27;t need to use it every day. I live in Colorado where it&#x27;s very dry and this has helped my eyes feel more hydrated as well as improving how they look. I&#x27;m all for an easy, relatively inexpensive product that works well, lasts awhile and makes a dramatic improvement in appearance without surgery. I have blue eyes and this makes them sparkle.</li>
    <li> For me, the best eye drops on the market for the price. This product has really worked for me, eyes are whiter and brighter and has taken out the yellow in my eye whites. I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> does not change or enhance anything.</li>
    <li> I buy this product on a regular basis.  I really think it makes the blue and white parts of my eyes brighter and more clear. It is part of my daily make up routine.</li>
    <li> I had Lazik Eye Surgery over 3months ago &amp; these are the only drops that really have helped with my dry eyes! My eyes are so alive &amp; vibrant &amp; vision better than expected!</li>
    <li> These eye drops are okay, but did not make my eyes as white as I expected like the whites of the eyes on the tv stars I have blue in my eyes that stained the pink area of my eyes that I did not like. I don&#x27;t like the blue that stained my clothes and anything near that some drops hit. So really it got some red out but not like I expected</li>
    <li> Use all the time, very good</li>
    <li> Have not been able to get these drops in Canada, so was very happy to be able to order them online. I love these drops, the whites of my eyes are much clearer.</li>
    <li> The best eye drops. Careful to not stain your clothing, however.</li>
    <li> When you have tired eyes, reach for these. I can&#x27;t say enough about these eyedrops. At the end of a very long day, just reach for these,</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference at all.</li>
    <li> Back in the early 90&#x27;s there was a product I got from St. Barths. One could not get it in the U.S.&lt;br /&gt;It made my eyes look amazing!&lt;br /&gt;This product seems to do little if anything to make the whites of your eyes actually &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34;....&lt;br /&gt;While it feels pleasant on the eye(doesn&#x27;t burn like a Visine product), it appears to do very little where brightening is concerned.  Perhaps my product was &amp;#34;watered down&amp;#34;? Who&#x27;s to really know while purchasing something on Amazon Prime....</li>
    <li> Not sure if it works don&#x27;t see a visible difference.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know what the hype was but these drops were expensive and don&#x27;t work any better than the stuff from the drug store.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Does not make the eyes any whiter or give comfort?  It is pkg&#x27;d nicely and the color in glass bottle is pretty, but that&#x27;s about it. Won&#x27;t  purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This did not work at all&lt;br /&gt;Blue drops in blue drops out&lt;br /&gt;Eyes still  lightened just a little bit</li>
    <li> Just what the doctor odered!</li>
    <li> i  got it today, and when I open it，one of them is broken.</li>
