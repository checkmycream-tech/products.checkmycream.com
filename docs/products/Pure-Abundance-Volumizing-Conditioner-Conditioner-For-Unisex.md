      <li>It gives my hair so much body and volume.</li>
      <li>If I&#x27;m on a trip and forget to bring some, I can really tell.</li>
      <li>I used it with the shampoo, and was very dissatisfied.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I love Aveda products and this is no exception for my fine, thin and sometimes flyaway hair.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend you give it a try.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The volume this creates works for 2-3 days</li>
    <li> Best conditioner I&#x27;ve found so far for making thin hair look thicker.  Can&#x27;t do without it.  The only draw back is the high price.</li>
    <li> After using soooo many different products, this will always be in my shower.  Pricey, yes, but it works, so that makes it worth it, plus it lasts a long time since I have short hair.  My hair is fine and thin; this not only gives bounce and control, but my hair is much healthier now.  I highly recommend you give it a try. I think it smells wonderful too.</li>
    <li> This product allows me to go a day in-between washes. I don&#x27;t wake up with flat hair the day after. The scent is a fresh clean scent. Definitely a must try. Did not give it the 5th star as my hair loses a little bit of it&#x27;s shine when I use it.  I recommend using it every other shampoo or even less.  Next I will try the shampoo that has the same name.  This is the fifth Aveda product I have tried and I have liked them all.</li>
    <li> Aveda products are the best there is.  They&#x27;re a little pricey but worth it.  This conditioner has a wonderful minty smell and does not weigh hair down.</li>
    <li> Pros: natural ingredients; very effective; nice and thick; actually quite affordable compared to other natural/organic products; smells GREAT to me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: wish it were less expensive (so does my husband lol)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: After having tried a number of other natural/organic hair products that would actully make my thin, fine, and sometimes oily hair look nice, this is an absolute necessity in my shower. Nothing else has worked as well, and it&#x27;s worth the price to me. I recommend it to others on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I ususally use Matrix Amplify (loyal user), but decided to try this.&lt;br /&gt;After using it twice, it made my hair flat and greasy.  I used it with the shampoo, and was very dissatisfied.&lt;br /&gt;I would throw it out, but my guests seem very impressed!</li>
    <li> This conditioner adds body to my fine  hair and I like that.  I&#x27;m not crazy about the &amp;#34;clay like&amp;#34; consistency and it doesn&#x27;t smell very good.  I use it every other shampoo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this miracle conditioner for years now. It smells wonderful and just a little bit will give you bouncy, fuller hair. I have baby fine hair that I highlight and this is just perfect. If I&#x27;m on a trip and forget to bring some, I can really tell. More than worth the price because you need such a small amount for it to make your hair amazing!!</li>
    <li> For being Aveda, I was expecting more. I didn&#x27;t feel my hair thicker at all, but I didnt used frequently. I&#x27;ll give it another try.</li>
    <li> I have long, wavy hair and this conditioner really does seem to give my hair more volume.  I normally wash it every 3 or 4 days, and it feels as full and clean as it did the day that I washed it (now four days ago!)</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000VZMYZS Aveda Pure Abundance Volumizing Clay Conditioner(16.8 oz)]]I love this product. It gives my hair so much body and volume.Mary</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000F4GIMA Aveda Pure Abundance Volumizing Clay Conditioner, 6.7-Ounce Tube]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am addicted to this conditioner. I have very thick, fine hair and I was always having problems with products weighing it down. This product is great for volume and smells delicious! It has a wonderful texture and I don&#x27;t have to use very much even though I have thick hair - the 6.7 oz tube actually lasts me at least 3 months. Great conditioner that doesn&#x27;t feel gummy or oily.</li>
    <li> This product really does work it increases volume and leaves my hair so soft. Great prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> Awesome conditioner. Great refreshing smell. I have thin wavy hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all.</li>
    <li> My husband has thinning hair and has finally found this miracle conditioner. It&#x27;s moisturizing, light weight, and does not weigh down his thinning hair at all. Excellent product, worth the expense!</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and this product works wonders. A great Aveda product. Use this religiously and my hair is much really getting healthy.</li>
    <li> So here is the deal, I&#x27;m in love with this product, but not the price tag. Being the educated and research driven student I am I decided to check around for prices. Some of the prices on Amazon.com are actually MORE expensive than directly from Aveda themselves. Go figure. Do some homework before buying and make sure you aren&#x27;t paying more than you need to!</li>
    <li> This does exactly what I had hoped it would, which is give me a tiny bit of extra fullness and at the same time some great conditioning.  It does exactly that.  My hair comes out fuller and fluffier while having some extra body and smoothness.  I didn&#x27;t need or want super volumizing as I have plenty of hair.  But it is a bit poofier when I use this.  It has a nice herbal scent also as most Aveda products do.  I&#x27;m quite pleased with this and will add it to my lineup of conditioners.</li>
    <li> I recommend this conditioner to everyone, especially with hair that is fine and unmaneagable.  Any conditioner usually weighs my hair down and the curling comes out, yet with Aveda Pure Abundance Volumizing Clay Conditioner-it is perfect</li>
    <li> I thought at these prices Aveda products would be great, but I&#x27;m not impressed. I don&#x27;t see any difference in my hair between using this conditioner and the $3.99 conditioner I get at Trader Joe&#x27;s. This one smells kind of nice, but upon close inspection, you&#x27;ll see that most of the fragrance comes from isolates, i.e. chemical constituents that make up essential oils, such as linalool found in lavender, geraniol in geranium, etc. These may be natural or synthetic, most likely the latter. Won&#x27;t be spending this king of money again.</li>
    <li> I love Aveda products and this is no exception for my fine, thin and sometimes flyaway hair.  It is not a deep moisturizer and does not weight down my hair at all.  The product itself is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint about the product is the industrial tape holding the lid on for shipment.  It was impossible to remove and left a sticky residue all over the cap and down the sides of the bottle.  Perhaps not all of them are shipped this way, but its a little annoying when my hand sticks to the bottle in the shower.</li>
    <li> This product is great if you have fine hair.  I have long fine hair and it wilts when it is humid outside.  I have a lot of fine hair, so I need to use a product that does not weigh down my hair.  The entire line of Pure Abundance is perfect for fine hair.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I somehow makes my hair feel rejuvenated and healthy.  I only need to use it periodically to give my hair a boost, but either way, it&#x27;s a product I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> It made my hair very soft without a over moisturized  feeling.  It was light on my hair when my hair was wet.  It surprised me how soft and behaved my hair was when I dryed it.</li>
    <li> This Aveda Pure Abundance Volumizing Clay Conditioner was so good for my hair.  I only gave it 3-stars because it did not give my fine, shoulder length hair very much volume.  A very good product which would probably work well for someone with thicker hair.</li>
    <li> This conditioner does a great job conditioning color treated hair and leaving it full looking.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is usually flat after it drys, but this hair conditioner really helps plump the hair after washing.</li>
    <li> do not like consistency</li>
