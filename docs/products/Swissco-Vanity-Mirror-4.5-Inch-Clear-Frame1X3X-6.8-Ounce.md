      <li>It&#x27;s attractive enough to leave out and visible.</li>

      <li>I bought this mirror for 5bucks anymore than than and your over paying plus my shipping was free and</li>

      <li>This is absolutely the best tool ever for correctly applying &#x27;false eyelashes&#x27;.  </li>

      <li>Very inexpensive though!</li>
      <li>it also seems very durable!</li>
      <li>The magnification isn&#x27;t strong so this is really only for makeup or shaving.</li>
      <li>but when I got my new bigger and better mirror</li>

      <li>Thanks Amazon  </li>
      <li>Makes doing eye makeup so much easier.</li>
      <li>Today I found that one of the mirrors had fallen gently off.  </li>
      <li>It was not broken, just lying in the curve of the frame.  </li>
      <li>BAD:/ cause I later decided to keep it for travel because my con air mirror isn&#x27;t very travel friendly.</li>
      <li>would spend a few more dollars and get a decently made mirror.</li>

      <li>but I saw the same exact one in the dollar store...</li>

      <li>The problem is that the fit is not that tight at all and</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s neither too heavy or too light, so it balances well.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s held up well so far.</li>
      <li>and I nearly cancelled the item.</li>
      <li>Only thing is the 3x side mirror does not magnify as much as I want.</li>
      <li>Make sure you check the size, because this mirror is very small.  </li>
      <li>Well, what do I say, a mirror can only show what is in front of it, neither better nor worse.  </li>
      <li>One side is normal mirror and the other is enlarged.</li>
      <li>This mirrior is just like any other normal mirror</li>

<li> so I could see the desk behind me.  </li>
<li> Came to me broken and dirty</li>
<li> In fact, when my order arrived, one of the mirror stands had already broken  :-(</li>
<li> The mirror comes in 2 pieces, the mirror itself and the base.</li>

    <li> Smaller than I thought, but good quality. One side is normal mirror and the other is enlarged. Delivered much later than I thought and I nearly cancelled the item. Very light and convenient to use.</li>
    <li> I LIKE MY MIRROR IS NICE MIRROR THAT IT IS A NICE MIRROR BUT THAT IS I HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO SAID</li>
    <li> I was really impressed by this mirror. I thought it would be much smaller, and not that great for the price. But I was mistaken! I love that you can take the mirror off the stand. Makes doing eye makeup so much easier. My only complaint is the magnifying side - not THAT great - but still good. Glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Perfectly as described!</li>
    <li> This is a very plain, simple mirror. It is very clear and the magnifying side is clear as well. It&#x27;s neither too heavy or too light, so it balances well. Also, style-wise, it&#x27;s actually better looking than I thought it would be. It&#x27;s attractive enough to leave out and visible.</li>
    <li> This mirrior is just like any other normal mirror my only complaintis that it got scratched in shipping my mom loved this as one of her christmas presents</li>
    <li> Works great, exactly what I was expecting. Seems sturdy and is a good size for applying makeup and facial creams. I like that it has a stand and can flip all the way around, so I can tilt the mirror at any angle. The base is very stable so there&#x27;s no danger of the mirror being knocked over. It&#x27;s also light enough to hold in one hand while applying makeup. I like the clear plastic of the base. It&#x27;s attractive enough to leave out. Great value for the price!</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror a few months ago, not the best quality, but works for me. Only thing is the 3x side mirror does not magnify as much as I want. Not the product&#x27;s fault, I will probably buy a 5x or 10x mirror.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best tool ever for correctly applying &#x27;false eyelashes&#x27;.  The magnification get you close and up front.</li>
    <li> Make sure you check the size, because this mirror is very small.  I use in my closet to put on jewelry, but not big enough for makeup in my opinion.  Very inexpensive though!</li>
    <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s cute looking and  perfect size mirror. Specially I needed good mirror when I make my eyebrows . its portable and I can carry anywhere anytime. However I am satisfied with this product . package came earlier than  I expected. Thanks Amazon  always you serve good quality  service.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good cheap mirror for the shower, and got the cheap part. The mirror comes in 2 pieces, the mirror itself and the base. The mirror has 2 ends that fit into holes on each side of the base. The problem is that the fit is not that tight at all and even the slightest movement cause the mirror to drop out. So if it is going to be static, then great. Though if you are planning to tilt the mirror, even slightly, then you are out of luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would spend a few more dollars and get a decently made mirror. It wasn&#x27;t even worth the hassle for me to send it back.</li>
    <li> I ordered this so I could do my makeup everywhere in the house, it&#x27;s not too small and it came wrapped well. I took a star off for being cheap plastic frame but it&#x27;s held up well so far. The magnification isn&#x27;t strong so this is really only for makeup or shaving.</li>
    <li> These are nice mirrors, but the plastic stand is very fragile. In fact, when my order arrived, one of the mirror stands had already broken  :-(</li>
    <li> I purchased this item 2 years, 4 months ago.  It has had very gentle use.  Mostly it sits on my dressing table.  It has never been dropped or in any other manner treated roughly.  Today I found that one of the mirrors had fallen gently off.  It was not broken, just lying in the curve of the frame.  I see now that it was secured by a very narror little line of glue to the back of the other mirror.  It is glass and could be dangerous if it broke, especially when handled by a child.  I have had other mirrors in the past with the same design and none of them ever had a glass fall off.  I am disappointed and regret buying this, even at the low price.  I gave it three stars because it does reflect and magnify OK and the plastic frame is still intact.  I will try to repair it with epoxy, but I would advise keeping it out of the reach of any children.</li>
    <li> I ordered this mirror to replace the one I currently use for eye makeup.  Great size, perfect for applying mascara, tweezing eyebrows, etc.  Easily removed from stand to use as hand held.  Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> this is a perfect little desk mirror thats great for makeup! its small and clear and really cute! great and worth the price! it also seems very durable!</li>
    <li> Ok what to say.... it is good quality However it is SMALL and not good for someone who is a makeup artists...your choice</li>
    <li> I got this to stand on my shelf so I could see the desk behind me.  The mirror image isn&#x27;t perfect, but for this purpose it is just what I needed.</li>
    <li> Well, what do I say, a mirror can only show what is in front of it, neither better nor worse.  This mirror does that quite well.</li>
    <li> Came to me broken and dirty</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror for a close-up mirror to use for putting on make-up. It works great for that purpose and it&#x27;s very light to move around on my dresser. Great find!</li>
    <li> I had no idea this came with two mirrors in a pack. I have on in my bathroom and one at my desk/vanity area. Not a day goes by that I don&#x27;t use either of them. They are really great for plucking to...the magnified side anyway lol.</li>
    <li> This mirror was not what I thought it would be. It is very small and flimsy; it was like something you would buy for a little girl</li>
    <li> This little mirror is perfect for what I needed and had a cheap price. seems like it might not hold up too well if it were dropped on a hard floor or something though...</li>
    <li> The mirror is very cheaply made, it certainly does the job but I saw the same exact one in the dollar store...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> It is in a good conditon and useful. If used as a mirror for makeup, it will be a little small. But it does save a lot of space on the desk.</li>
    <li> before I got my Con air lighted mirror I had this one it served its purpose but i needed a bigger lighted one so I could do my hair and makeup in the dark so I would wake my husband in the morning and night. I bought this mirror for 5bucks anymore than than and your over paying plus my shipping was free and no tax just 5bucks that what I feel its worth. Its still holding up after 1year but when I got my new bigger and better mirror I kinda got to excited and throw it on the floor and the bottom is wiggly now MY BAD:/ cause I later decided to keep it for travel because my con air mirror isn&#x27;t very travel friendly.</li>
