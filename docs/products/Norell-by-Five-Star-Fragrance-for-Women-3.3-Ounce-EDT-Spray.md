      <li>Great Name, Great Products, Happy Customer or call it</li>
      <li>I am so happy I found it at Amazon.</li>
      <li>product was up to her standards and it made me feel great giving it to her.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
      <li>Amazon for having great quality products people can trust.</li>
      <li>and then very, very nice.</li>
      <li>but I find it very nice and comforting.  </li>
      <li>The good news is that it is a very nice fragrance.</li>
      <li>Norell has always made good products.  </li>
      <li>Great service, a favorite fragrance.</li>
      <li>Ladies, men LOVE this cologne!  </li>
      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to know that it is still available.</li>
      <li>When I was 23 my (then) boyfriend asked me what kind of cologne I wanted (for my bday).</li>
      <li>I told him to get me whatever he liked.</li>
      <li>She said it was the real Norell and was very happy with it.</li>
      <li>I have had to buy popular fragrances and there about $50, so this bottle is a bargain at around $20.</li>
      <li>Always a sure fire sign that its a nice scent.</li>
      <li>the price seems too good to be true, it probably is.</li>
      <li>I love Norell because it gains its smell from your moods.</li>
      <li>It is much more $ now to buy it.</li>
      <li>I have worn this scent for many years.</li>
      <li>I have worn Norell for many, many years.  </li>
      <li>Wish I had bought more when it was cheaper.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Always deal with reputable businesses.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>The number one way to avoid getting ripped off when buying luxury goods is to deal with reputable businesses.</li>
      <li>Men love it.</li>
      <li>Craftsmanship is king for most luxury brands.</li>
      <li>And, I haven&#x27;t been able to find it for sale anywhere.  </li>
      <li>While Norell is a very nice fragrance it doesn&#x27;t really remind me of Chanel at all.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this classic fragrance for more than thirty years and Amazon has the best price by far.</li>
      <li>Made a Great present for a lady that has used this Norell Fragrance for years and still love it so does the rest of the family.  </li>
      <li>The Norell ordered came in fine smelling fashion ....</li>
      <li>Since this product is no longer made, I was glad to be able to purchase a new bottle.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what they have done to the original formula, but there is no comparison.</li>
      <li>Not the original.</li>
      <li>It has a very nice flowery scent, slightly strong until it dries down</li>
      <li>More good news is that it&#x27;s about half the price of Chanel.</li>
      <li>One of the most classic fragrances ever.  </li>
      <li>The sweet smell of success</li>
      <li>The only problem I have with it is that stores don&#x27;t sell it any more!  </li>
      <li>This one is very close to the original.  </li>
      <li>If the sunglasses snap in two in the first week, or if the stitching and seams are ragged and don’t match up on a purse, the items are probably counterfeit.</li>
      <li>Considering that the name is a large part of the motivation for buying a luxury brand, many manufacturers spend considerable time and energy on crafting the physical label.</li>
      <li>It is a soft fragrance that can be enjoyed not only by the person wearing it but also by others as you come into contact with it.</li>
      <li>But it is so perfectly blended the other notes are hard to discern.  </li>
      <li>So let me put it this way:  Norell is classic.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any high notes, and I don&#x27;t think anyone would be offended by it.</li>
      <li>Overuse of “genuine,” “real” or “authentic” is a bad sign.</li>
      <li>but we live and learn.</li>
      <li>I guess I&#x27;ll just say that I averaged out at $75.00 each and be more careful next time.</li>
      <li>My 90 year old Mom asked me to get her Norell, well it&#x27;s not avilable at any department stores, the gals that work there never even heard of it.</li>
      <li>Different luxury brands, such as purses, have specific hardware consumers can rely on to identify a genuine piece.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a smell I associate with old ladies (emphasis on the ladies) and/</li>
      <li>This is an old school fragrance.</li>
      <li>My only complaint is that I used to buy it on Amazon at 2/$30 with free shipping!</li>
      <li>For bargain-hunters looking for name-brand items at discount prices online, Better Business Bureau offers advice on avoiding web-based rip-off schemes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, I was surprised that  the price of this fragrance has tripled since the last time I purchased</li>
      <li>Charles Norell was a big time designer and the fragrance was developed by Revlon.</li>
      <li>so I really appreciate receiving it as expected.</li>
      <li>Although the product was expensive, my wife was thrilled and it made her Christmas!&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This cologne has been around for years and it has not lost its fragramatic qualities.  I love Norell because it gains its smell from your moods. It is a soft fragrance that can be enjoyed not only by the person wearing it but also by others as you come into contact with it.</li>
    <li> Although the product was expensive, my wife was thrilled and it made her Christmas!&lt;br /&gt;She has been wearing it for years and it is hard to find, not to mention fresh.&lt;br /&gt;The product was up to her standards and it made me feel great giving it to her.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon for having great quality products people can trust.</li>
    <li> The wives loves this perfume</li>
    <li> This scent smelled like old-fashioned body powder to me.  It&#x27;s a smell I associate with old ladies (emphasis on the ladies) and/but I find it very nice and comforting.  It doesn&#x27;t have any high notes, and I don&#x27;t think anyone would be offended by it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this classic fragrance for more than thirty years and Amazon has the best price by far.</li>
    <li> This is an old school fragrance. Charles Norell was a big time designer and the fragrance was developed by Revlon. My 90 year old Mom asked me to get her Norell, well it&#x27;s not avilable at any department stores, the gals that work there never even heard of it. Five Star Fragrances still sells the stuff, thank god and it seems to be the same stuff thank goodness. I have had to buy popular fragrances and there about $50, so this bottle is a bargain at around $20. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have used this cologne exclusively for 35 years.  Hard to find in stores.I am so happy I found it at Amazon.</li>
    <li> Item arrived within two days! Great service, a favorite fragrance. Amazon prices are often the lowest on the same product offered elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; fragrance for everyday wear. I regularly purchase it for occasions of all kinds and never disappoint.</li>
    <li> The best BUT I used to pay 25$ a bottle what the heck happened?</li>
    <li> Not the original. A bad knock off.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife who has worn this for years. She said it was the real Norell and was very happy with it. Shortly after receiving this Norell,I discovered Norell in the same package at a local mall in a perfume kiosk selling for $48.00. This was less than half of the Five Star Fragrance price of $103.00. My wife tells me that the two perfumes are identical. She had already opened the Five Star product so it could not be returned. Very disappointed but we live and learn. I guess I&#x27;ll just say that I averaged out at $75.00 each and be more careful next time.</li>
    <li> I have worn Norell for many, many years.  I was sad when they discontinued making the original Norell.  This one is very close to the original.  I love it.</li>
    <li> It was not for me - but the Lady loves it - Thank you</li>
    <li> Not only did it not meet my expectations, it stinks, literally. I don&#x27;t know what they have done to the original formula, but there is no comparison. I&#x27;m sorry to say that after at least 25 yrs of wearing Norell, I will no longer be using it.</li>
    <li> ALL THE NORELL SOLD ON AMAZON IS A KNOCK OFF&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.bbb.org/central-florida/news-events/news-releases/2014/07/buyers-beware-as-shoddy-internet-knock-offs-infiltrate-the-internet/&lt;br /&gt;Buyers Beware as Shoddy Internet Knock-Offs Infiltrate the Internet&lt;br /&gt;July 22, 2014&lt;br /&gt;The market for counterfeit luxury items is wide and deep, selling everything from jewelry and perfume to handbags and sunglasses. For bargain-hunters looking for name-brand items at discount prices online, Better Business Bureau offers advice on avoiding web-based rip-off schemes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always deal with reputable businesses. The number one way to avoid getting ripped off when buying luxury goods is to deal with reputable businesses. When in doubt, shoppers can contact the manufacturer and verify which venders are authorized sellers. Consumers should also check out the business with BBB before making a purchasing decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the price seems too good to be true, it probably is. One of the biggest red flags for knock-off merchandise is an unrealistic price. Extremely low prices are tempting but not to be believed. Paying $100 for a $1000 purse could result in the consumer receiving a poorly constructed – and worthless – fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read between the lines. Some websites or online classified ads will go overboard in their description of the item in order to coax the buyer’s trust.  Overuse of “genuine,” “real” or “authentic” is a bad sign. Buyers also need to keep an eye out for sneaky phrases like “inspired by.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check the merchandise. Considering that the name is a large part of the motivation for buying a luxury brand, many manufacturers spend considerable time and energy on crafting the physical label. Counterfeiters aren’t usually as meticulous.  Shoppers should look for misspelled words and brand names, poorly sewn logos and labels, etc. Some luxury goods carry an “authenticity label” with a hologram or other security measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Know the brand. Different luxury brands, such as purses, have specific hardware consumers can rely on to identify a genuine piece. Zippers, screws, clasps and stitching are usually very specific for the brand and the manufacturer often has details on their website explaining what to look for and how to spot a knock-off. Craftsmanship is king for most luxury brands. If the sunglasses snap in two in the first week, or if the stitching and seams are ragged and don’t match up on a purse, the items are probably counterfeit.</li>
    <li> I have worn this scent for many years. Men love it. My only complaint is that I used to buy it on Amazon at 2/$30 with free shipping! Now it&#x27;s $100/bottle! Wish I had bought more when it was cheaper.</li>
    <li> Made a Great present for a lady that has used this Norell Fragrance for years and still love it so does the rest of the family.  Norell has always made good products.  Great Name, Great Products, Happy Customer or call it GNP makes HC</li>
    <li> When I was 23 my (then) boyfriend asked me what kind of cologne I wanted (for my bday). I told him to get me whatever he liked. He bought me Norell. Well, I loved this cologne! Flash forward 25 years, I still wear Norell. The scent is wonderful. It does not smell like an &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; scent! It is the perfect balance of scents. Not over powering, not too flowery or too woodsy. When I wear this cologne I get compliments from women and men. Ladies, men LOVE this cologne!  The only problem I have with it is that stores don&#x27;t sell it any more!  I&#x27;ve googled the company that makes it and I think it&#x27;s for sale. Have they stopped making Norell? Say it isn&#x27;t so! Oh, one thing. It is much more $ now to buy it. But, considering all the horrendous &amp;#34;designer&amp;#34; fragrances on the market (at horrendous prices), Norell is a bargain!</li>
    <li> And, I haven&#x27;t been able to find it for sale anywhere.  Amazon was my last attempt.  It smells the same, and I am still getting compliments from people everywhere about my perfume.  Now it is outrageously expensive.</li>
    <li> The Norell ordered came in fine smelling fashion .... on time ... it is getting more&lt;br /&gt;difficult to find so I really appreciate receiving it as expected.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for years and years.  Need to get another bottle but don&#x27;t see it anywhere. Help. Help me get another bottle same size.</li>
    <li> I had never used this scent before but had read that it was similar to Chanel 5.  While Norell is a very nice fragrance it doesn&#x27;t really remind me of Chanel at all.  The good news is that it is a very nice fragrance. It has a very nice flowery scent, slightly strong until it dries down and then very, very nice. More good news is that it&#x27;s about half the price of Chanel. It also stayed with me for a long time which I like.  I did recieve a compliment or two also.  Always a sure fire sign that its a nice scent.</li>
    <li> I have used this fragrance for the past twenty years.. At that time it could be purchased in the department stores like Jordan Marsh&lt;br /&gt;and Burdines.  However, I was surprised that  the price of this fragrance has tripled since the last time I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to know that it is still available.</li>
    <li> Since this product is no longer made, I was glad to be able to purchase a new bottle.</li>
    <li> Norell is hard to describe.  It is a floral with a dominance of carnation.  But it is so perfectly blended the other notes are hard to discern.  So let me put it this way:  Norell is classic.  One of the most classic fragrances ever.  It is a &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; perfume:  perfect for any season, time of day, weather, occasion.  You will never go wrong wearing this one.  A &amp;#34;foundation&amp;#34; perfume to build a collection around.</li>
    <li> The sweet smell of success</li>
</ol>
