      <li>Got 2b glued is an amazing product</li>
      <li>This product is amazing.</li>
      <li>before and liked it, but thought I&#x27;d give this one a try when I re-ordered.</li>
      <li>For one, it has a really good smell (caramel smell) and washes off hands easily.  </li>
      <li>My hair is very fine</li>
      <li>Hurts to try and move my hair after, but it defintely has a strong hold!</li>
      <li>First of all, this glue is great.</li>
      <li>I was pleased to use it for making my spikes on Superbowl Sunday.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Always did love this stuff</li>
      <li>So much better then</li>
      <li>and I love to spike it.</li>
      <li>and I wanted to get creative with the ends of it.</li>
      <li>This spiking glue is PHENOMENAL.  </li>
      <li>I use able 3 of them almost.</li>
      <li>for short to medium hair spikes, this is wonderful.  </li>
      <li>Im glad I did.</li>
      <li>I have tried many different gels/glues/sprays to keep my hair styled all day, and this product works the best.</li>
      <li>So before applying the glue condition your hair with your favorite conditioner and leave hair damped.    </li>
      <li>As advertised, and since stores dont seem to carry it anymore, glad to get it.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite hair gel.</li>
      <li>or you will feel as though you can just snap your hair right off!!</li>
      <li>and now my hair spikes right up on its own, even after drying it off after a wash.</li>
      <li>think I may try it in  my mustache as it may be good for training up a handlebar instead of the old wax stuff! :)</li>
      <li>Other than that, this and the spray are great!</li>
      <li>It also washes out easy.</li>
      <li>It lasts all day and comes off easily.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Hands down best style product for bros and bros alike</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also used the Got2B freezing spray with this to set style, but noticed it works fine without the spray.</li>
      <li>It washed out fine too.</li>
      <li>Easy to fix, excellent to sculpt, can look natural with modest application and a little roughing, my perfect hair product.</li>
      <li>But wow, I was impressed; my hair was like soft cement.  </li>
      <li>want.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves no visible residue like cheap hairspray or gel.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
      <li>i LOVE this product and find it&#x27;s so much more reasonably priced on amazon than retail ...</li>
      <li>Glued Spiking Glue, Styling, Original, 6 oz.]]</li>
      <li>What fun it was!</li>
      <li>This is the original &amp;#34;Got2B Glued&amp;#34; hair product.</li>
      <li>&quot; I am new to this kind of product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The original has good hold (it is white and thickish like elmer&#x27;s</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is my absolute favorite hair gel.  </li>
      <li>(although I find the best results on dry hair).&lt;br /&gt;Primarily for spiking but also usable for short hair sculpting, this strong stuff can also help &amp;#34;train&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>So there is not a over all super gel on the market.</li>
      <li>Be warned though, that this stuff hardens fast and strong.</li>
      <li>and it is an absolute killer!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve recently decided that I wanted to wear a handlebar moustache, but because my hair has a mind of its own moustache wax was just not doing it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>They expanded their product line after the success of it, but this is the one to stick with, no pun intended.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time now - There is no gel/glue out there that achives the amazing hold that Got2B Glued does.</li>
      <li>Holds up my hair nicely, and it stays in there for a long time.</li>
      <li>I hardly have frizzy fly away hairs.  </li>
      <li>AND, if you don&#x27;t shampoo EVERY day, you can just wet your hands, run them through your hair and voila - amazing</li>
      <li>i have used many different brands and strength type.</li>
      <li>The texture is actually that of a glue/paste mix, and for spiking, you can&#x27;t find a more reliable gel or moose.</li>
      <li>I have a pretty sizable handlebar mustache</li>
      <li>I will update later as I know more about it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This gel never fails me, 16 years running.</li>
      <li>you couldnt ask also for a better priced product only about 8 dollars.</li>
      <li>I used to use some much more expensive stuff, but this is way more affordable and does the job even better.</li>
      <li>TOO MUCH HOLD!</li>
      <li>you MUST use soap and hot water to get it off your hands after applying but your hair will stay in place.  </li>
      <li>As of right now this is the ONLY hair product that I use, but be forewarned, styling doesn&#x27;t come without a relatively easy learning curve.     </li>
      <li>Its thick and tacky so for my fine hair, it grabs it all nicely.</li>
      <li>I have very fine, short hair and found that if I worked about a  1/2 dime-sized amount into wet hair, it worked better than hair spray, and yet prevents frizz.  </li>
      <li>I use this on my synthetic cosplay wigs and they work really well keeping spikes and many different hairstyles in place.</li>
      <li>I ordered the large tube from Amazon, and it lasts forever.  </li>
      <li>For reference, I have really fine, straight, chest-length Asian hair.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a little over a decade. Can you believe that?</li>
    <li> This is serious glue for real hold...ALL DAY LONG, and even into the next day. Just add some water to your hair to restyle and reactivate the product. I have tried many different gels/glues/sprays to keep my hair styled all day, and this product works the best. I have only exclusively used this product for the past four years and will continue to buy it for a long time to come. It never flakes off like other gels, which is a huge plus. Just be careful not to put too much on or you will feel as though you can just snap your hair right off!!</li>
    <li> So there is not a over all super gel on the market. I use this and mix it in with sports gel some cheap blue stuff from the drop store. But the outcome is 5 stars</li>
    <li> I spike my hair up and those other clear gels and etc don&#x27;t work.     I accidentally discovered this one several years ago and I LOVE IT!     It&#x27;s the best gel ever to hold my hair in place. FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My son wanted a seriously crazy hairdo for spririt day at school and we turned to this product.  We made 4 inch spikes all over his head.  They stayed up all day even the ones on the back of his head that were sticking out horizontal to the ground.  It washed out fine too.</li>
    <li> for short to medium hair spikes, this is wonderful.  the product does not leave a white or yellow tint as many of them do</li>
    <li> Best hair stuff ever!! Trust me once I tried this I never went back too my old stuff!! So give it a try!</li>
    <li> WOW!!! this stuff is amazing!! extremely tough!! :)</li>
    <li> Ive tried basically all hair gels, pomades, creams, you name it. I used to use American Crew Fiber in which it held ok, but throughout the day loses its hold factor, plus was crazy expensive. Then tried Joico Spiker which also expensive, holds well but looks and smells too much like Elmers school glue, plus was hard to wash off hands. I was in Wal-Mart this past month saw Got2B Spiking glue and thought Id give it a try.  Im glad I did. For one, it has a really good smell (caramel smell) and washes off hands easily.  It like the Joico, holds really well and have actually gotten compliments on my hair. I like the way you can mold your hair with this product and spike hair.  I&#x27;ve also used the Got2B freezing spray with this to set style, but noticed it works fine without the spray. Mainly use the spray for the sides of my hair that tend to poof out after a while. you couldnt ask also for a better priced product only about 8 dollars. Well within budget. It also washes out easy.</li>
    <li> Holds hair all day and then some! Styles well!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and received what was expected.</li>
    <li> Feels like glue in the hair! Hurts to try and move my hair after, but it defintely has a strong hold!</li>
    <li> Excellent and good product. Sticky and Spiking for a whole day, even walking in the rain for less than 10 seconds. Feels like you put the glue on the head.  I use able 3 of them almost. And Walgreen sales this for $7 per.</li>
    <li> i LOVE this product and find it&#x27;s so much more reasonably priced on amazon than retail ... This product WILL spike your hair - mind you, i&#x27;m a 60 year old woman with short, naturally platinum, VERY sassy hair ... This \\&quot;spiking glue\\&quot; is akin to a thick \\&quot;elmer&#x27;s glue-all\\&quot; and totally water-soluble ... you MUST use soap and hot water to get it off your hands after applying but your hair will stay in place.  AND, if you don&#x27;t shampoo EVERY day, you can just wet your hands, run them through your hair and voila - amazing look the next day, too ... I LOVE this product!</li>
    <li> I have used both, the black is more watery as said, closer to gel, and of little use for stubborn hair. The yellow is the ultimate hair bonding experience, let it air out a second before application and it IS glue. Stays in place even if mussed up, bed head has no effect, yet not stiff and painful to run your fingers through. Easy to fix, excellent to sculpt, can look natural with modest application and a little roughing, my perfect hair product.</li>
    <li> My son just got a Mohawk and this is the only gel type product that will hold ALL day long. He is very active and no matter how much he sweats and plays his hawk stays in place. I don&#x27;t like how stick it leaves your hands and sometimes you have to really rub it in otherwise you see the white. Other than that this stuff rocks.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Its thick and tacky so for my fine hair, it grabs it all nicely. I hardly have frizzy fly away hairs.  You only get about 30 seconds before it becomes a little unmanageable but I just slick it through and spike it up and im done.  The smell is like a Carmel apple in my opinion.   For me it will last about 3 months.</li>
    <li> Well, my son LOVES the holding power of this stuff.  However, beware if you get it on the bathroom countertop.  I tried nail polish remover and bathroom cleaner to remove it - no success.  I finally let deep-cleaning shampoo set on the hair product for a few minutes, and with some elbow grease, was able to get it off my countertop (however, you can still see where the product was).  I don&#x27;t know about you... but if it&#x27;s THAT difficult to get off of a bathroom counter, I don&#x27;t want it on my hair.</li>
    <li> the only thing I&#x27;ve found that can hold my hair.</li>
    <li> use it for the curls in my hair! great!</li>
    <li> If you have coarse hair this product is made for you. After restlessly trying to find a hair gel, paste or glue that can spike my hair with intensity I have finally found it. Before the success of the show Jersey Shore and explosion of the gel industry as a result, I was on a quest to find, what at the time seemed impossible: a hair product that actually spiked my stubborn hair.     Personally my hair isn&#x27;t straight nor is it curly, it&#x27;s rather coarse. As a result normal strength hair gels simply do not hold my hair for any longer than a few minutes. Soon after applying normal gels it would deform and the spikes would just branch out in a mess. This was a problem as I wanted to try newer hairstyles like the faux hawk and similar styles that required massive amounts of spiking.    As of right now this is the ONLY hair product that I use, but be forewarned, styling doesn&#x27;t come without a relatively easy learning curve.     (Step 1) Preparation    If you don&#x27;t wash and condition your hair before applying this product you will get dry and flakey spikes. So before applying the glue condition your hair with your favorite conditioner and leave hair damped.    (Step 2) Applying  If you just want spikes without any after effects like glossy finish, just apply a small amount to your damped hair. If you want rocker style spikes (the one that looks glossy) just wet your hair with water as you spike and use a blow dryer to dry the wet spike as you hold up the tip of the spike.    The only problem I have with this product is that it tends to dry out if you don&#x27;t wash your hair with conditioner, and flakes bad if you move it around after it sets. On the plus side it lasts all day long and doesn&#x27;t take much product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this on a daily basis like i used to, but this is a must have.  I discovered it when I was 15.</li>
    <li> I use this to aid in styling doll hair. This tube may last forever as only a small dab goes a very long way. Can be diluted with water. I do not see a residue when it&#x27;s dry even on black hair.  Recommended!</li>
    <li> I have very stubborn wavy hair.  This gel is the only one I&#x27;ve found that works, and I&#x27;ve tried a LOT.  I found that if I apply it before blow drying, it doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy.  But if I want it to be really spiky and stiff, I&#x27;ll apply it once my hair is dried, and it&#x27;s great.  It doesn&#x27;t flake, and if something messes up my hair during the day, I can wet my hands and re-style on the go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my absolute favorite hair gel.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> As advertised, and since stores dont seem to carry it anymore, glad to get it.</li>
    <li> Holds hair for hours!</li>
    <li> TOO MUCH HOLD! Hard to get into your hair.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased a small tube of this from the pharmacy.  I have very fine, short hair and found that if I worked about a  1/2 dime-sized amount into wet hair, it worked better than hair spray, and yet prevents frizz.  I ordered the large tube from Amazon, and it lasts forever.  It is not to heavy or oily.</li>
    <li> This spiking glue is PHENOMENAL.  I was a treasure troll doll for Halloween this year, so I needed all of my hair stand straight up.  I&#x27;m not punk, so I was completely inexperienced in this department.  For reference, I have really fine, straight, chest-length Asian hair.  The beauty store person recommended this spiking glue, and it did the trick!  I was skeptical about whether I could actually get ALL my hair to stand up in a giant spike since it&#x27;s so long, but it did in the end.  I used freeze hair spray, a blow dryer, and this spiking glue.  You really have to rub it in to get rid of the white streaks.  And the hair has to be combed straight and just how you want it before putting in the glue though, because once it&#x27;s in, it can get gnarled like crazy if you aren&#x27;t careful.  But wow, I was impressed; my hair was like soft cement.  I was also impressed that it washed out reallllly easily.  Just 1 good wash with shampoo got out just about everything.  I highly recommend this stuff!</li>
    <li> This is the original &amp;#34;Got2B Glued&amp;#34; hair product. They expanded their product line after the success of it, but this is the one to stick with, no pun intended. The texture is actually that of a glue/paste mix, and for spiking, you can&#x27;t find a more reliable gel or moose. Many gels regardless of their &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; level simply weigh your hair down. Got2B Glued spikes and sculpts even longer hair without the need for a blow drier (although I find the best results on dry hair).&lt;br /&gt;Primarily for spiking but also usable for short hair sculpting, this strong stuff can also help &amp;#34;train&amp;#34; your hair. I used this for a while and now my hair spikes right up on its own, even after drying it off after a wash.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair gel. I used to use some much more expensive stuff, but this is way more affordable and does the job even better. My only complaint is that sometimes it separates. Rather than being a consistent white gel, sometimes it separates and there&#x27;s a clear fluid that comes out with little specks of white.</li>
    <li> This reminds me of Elmers glue, with added flagrance.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff will get your hair to go however you want.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves no visible residue like cheap hairspray or gel.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking at this product because someone told how great it is, they were right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hands down best style product for bros and bros alike</li>
    <li> Item is NOT as described.  It is the &#x27;&#x27;Got2B&#x27;&#x27; brand, but IS NOT the &#x27;Glued&#x27; product as described....what a disappointment.</li>
    <li> I have used this gel for YEARS. This gel will last all day and keeps its hold. I&#x27;ve even jumped in the pool with this stuff on and came out with my hair the way I shaped it in the morning! I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other products that resulted in flaky dandruff like flakes- which was just nasty. This is great for just about any hair and it&#x27;s a good price.</li>
    <li> this hair is for all types, curly, straight, any. it never fails, specially if I don&#x27;t wash my hair next day I don&#x27;t get the white flakes that other gels give.</li>
    <li> Always did love this stuff</li>
    <li> This gel never fails me, 16 years running.</li>
    <li> Ever since I was young I have had stubborn thick hair that I was always told \\&quot;we can do nothing with\\&quot;. This stuff will keep my hair in place for a whole day, whereas most other gels are lucky to last five minutes. Take caution with where you store it though. it turns into almost like a plastic when dries on normal stuff. Accidentally punctured it while trying to open it with a nail on the wall, was in a rush and put it down, leaked out of the side. When I picked it up the next morning, paint from the shelf came up with it to. It also sealed the hole I made accidentally. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> this is one of the best gels i have ever used been using it for a couple of months and it is an absolute killer!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good stuff to use without the grease or wax. Works like a charm when i use it in my hair. So much better then the others i have used. I been using this for years now.</li>
    <li> Love this sh*t! Works great!</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for</li>
    <li> I picked up a small tube of this stuff at my local CVS and let me tell ya that this stuff does hold.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recently decided that I wanted to wear a handlebar moustache, but because my hair has a mind of its own moustache wax was just not doing it.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works wonderfully. Now the curl of the stache stays put.</li>
    <li> I have been using hair gel since i was 14. i have used many different brands and strength type. After using this Got2b spiking gule i have never bought any other brand gel. This product is amazing. You can use very little on wet hair and your are got to go for the whole day n night. Plus it does not leave the white flakes after you take it off or forget to wash it for the night, this is a BIG PLUS. This stuff works great at keeping the hair where I want. This is serious glue for real hold. I does what it states. FIVE STAR product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time now - There is no gel/glue out there that achives the amazing hold that Got2B Glued does. It could easily last a whole day long, yet when you shower or comb, it would come out very easily, with no residue or flakes. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is the best spiking glue I have ever tried. I have been using that product for about 7 years now. I don&#x27;t want to change.</li>
    <li> Keeps the hair down.  Good product.</li>
    <li> Being an \\&quot;old guy\\&quot; I am new to this kind of product. I have used the \\&quot;original\\&quot; [[ASIN:B000142OC2 Got2B Glued Spiking Glue, Styling, Original, 6 oz.]] before and liked it, but thought I&#x27;d give this one a try when I re-ordered. [[ASIN:B001G7QYY2 Got 2b Glued Spiking Glue 6-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 3)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original has good hold (it is white and thickish like elmer&#x27;s glue)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is much thinner and clear, and I think gives a slightly \\&quot;harder\\&quot; hold. Plus if you apply it to wet hair it will retain the \\&quot;wet\\&quot; look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have minor complaints (they both work) This one is much thinner and since the tube sits on its top, if you aren&#x27;t careful you&#x27;ll dump a whole handful out at once. I actually thought the tube was leaking at first. This is a bit annoying since normally it only takes quite a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only other complaint is this clear one never really \\&quot;dries\\&quot; so if you lay your head down on a pillow or against a chair, your hair will compress up and mat a bit (this may be in part due to the VERY HUMID weather we have been having.. I will update later as I know more about it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I slightly prefer the original as it has less of these problems, but both do the job and are reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see some are selling them in \\&quot;packs of three\\&quot;. It would be nice if they would offer a sampler pack containing several different products.. especially since the cost of shipping is a large part of the product price, they could sell the sets at very reasonable prices! They make such a large array of products it actually is a bit confusing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I may try it in  my mustache as it may be good for training up a handlebar instead of the old wax stuff! :)</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing at keeping your hair in place without making it look stiff.  I have a pretty standard hairstyle - cut relatively short, but not buzzed, hair parted on top and comb to the side and back, with the hair on my sides combed straight back. My hair is very fine and I generally used a pomade to keep the hair on my sides from falling down and to keep the hair on top of my head in place, but when it would grow a little longer, that would not be enough - I need to use the promenade plus hairspray and it just got annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works great at keeping the hair where I want it. I put it in after towel drying my hair and then come it out about 20 minutes later so that it doesn&#x27;t have the wetlook. This is a great product.</li>
    <li> Great for gluing hair</li>
    <li> Works great to do twists and tricks with a stach.</li>
    <li> this is insane hold! i can ride round all day in a helo and not a hair out of place!</li>
    <li> This works great for styling wigs. It lasts all day and comes off easily. The only thing I dont like is that its really sticky. But I guess that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
    <li> This is awesome spiking gel. I was pleased to use it for making my spikes on Superbowl Sunday. What fun it was! It did take a couple of shampoos to get it removed.  It could have lasted for days with wonderful stiffness.</li>
    <li> I use this on my synthetic cosplay wigs and they work really well keeping spikes and many different hairstyles in place.</li>
    <li> Wow this stuff will not let go even if you want it to...plastic like coating stays on your hair sometimes even beyond a shampoo...however your hair will not move...LOL</li>
    <li> I have used this product on my spiked hair-doo for 5 years....best price going! Great product....terrific price and I recommed it.</li>
    <li> First of all, this glue is great. Holds up my hair nicely, and it stays in there for a long time. One thing you might want to be wary about with short hair is that if left in for a long time and it touched the scalp it will start to itch. May just be me, but be careful about that. Other than that, this and the spray are great!</li>
    <li> This stuff is heavy duty and pretty extreme when it comes to holding hair in place. I have a pretty sizable handlebar mustache and I wanted to get creative with the ends of it. My friend suggested this stuff and I must say it works and holds really well. Be warned though, that this stuff hardens fast and strong.</li>
    <li> I was satisfied within 5 seconds when i used this product! Perfect for vertical hair hold, i would recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> I never leave home without it. It&#x27;s always windy outside.</li>
    <li> Got 2b glued is an amazing product and I was very skeptical that it would work. My husband bought this for me, I have really short hair and I love to spike it. I have tried all kinds of styling products and was really looking not to use hair spray. I have tried all kinds of the Axe styling products and various others. I always go back to Mouse and Hairspray to keep my spikes in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a product that would hold if even if I started sweating or if I am outside and it starts to rain. So I took this product for a test drive and it passed with flying colors. I wet my hair and spiked it up. It doesn’t take long for it dry, which is nice. I mowed the lawn and was sweating it never budged. I had this product in my hair for 15 hours and I never had to reapply it. I took a shower and drenched my head and my spikes never moved not until I shampooed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am forever going to be a lifelong customer of this product and the smell is not overbearing even when it gets wet doesn’t give off a strong order. Even the next day my hair didn’t feel even a little crispy or smell like the product like some other styling gels that are out there.</li>
    <li> This product is great for handlebar mustache wearers. Men in the past wore mustache wax, but in humid climates got2b glued spiking glue is better suited to hold.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm if you want hair to stay in position.</li>
    <li> A few months ago I was in a show and someone brought this in during dress rehearsal. For all of my life I had been using hair gels which seemed to look greasy and not keep my think hair up for the whole day. I tried some of this and what I could do to my hair was absolutely incredible. Because it&#x27;s long, now I put it in wet, but BE CAREFUL. You don&#x27;t need much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing wrong with this in my eyes, so 5 stars.</li>
    <li> nothing beats this glue. it holds your hair for a week straight</li>
