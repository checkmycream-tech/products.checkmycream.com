### Positive Reviews

      <li>/&gt;The best part about SGBHCs is that they are chalk.</li>
      <li>then but every day use may not be the best for the hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s best not to run a comb through the hair after you&#x27;ve applied the chalk as it lightens the color.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The best part about SGBHCs is that they are chalk.</li>
      <li>These are the best!  </li>
      <li>These work great.</li>
      <li>It looks great and all my friends want me to do their hair.</li>
      <li>You have a palette of colors here to suit not just your makeup or outfit, but maybe your dog, or room, the logo of your favorite football team \\&quot;Who DEY!!</li>

      <li>The color washes out easily and goes on perfectly.  </li>
      <li>She loved it.</li>
      <li>The good news, though?</li>
      <li>Loved this hair chalk.</li>
      <li>The good news, though?</li>
      <li>/&gt;These chalks are so easy to use - and they apply a beautiful color - no mater</li>
      <li>We both looked lovely!</li>
      <li>These work better than ANY hair chalks we have ever used!</li>
      <li>I accepted this product for an honest review</li>
      <li>your own masterpiece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The colors were housed in a nice casing and were intact.</li>
      <li>nice part is that the color does stay all day.</li>
      <li>If you use the right products (good quality) you will be happy with the results and I was.</li>
      <li>Although there are many shades some are brighter than others.</li>
      <li>I just wish there was a bit more of the chalk.</li>
      <li>I have many allergies and cannot use hair dye, so I have been suffering with two tone hair.  </li>
      <li>I purchase as a gift hoping they will love it.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
      <li>Be sure to use gloves because it gets everywhere.</li>
      <li>Be sure to use a towel or a barber&#x27;s cape while putting the color in your hair.</li>
      <li>Regarding hair, the discomforting feeling could might vary from person to person, but from my perspective, I would look for a better product and will not recommend some to any of my friends.</li>
      <li>3 star indicating product is ok?</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Oh, and if you want a change, or you make a mistake, or just want to try something else, a good shampooing is all that you need and a fresh slate is at hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
      <li>Once you do your hair be sure not to touch it again.  </li>

      <li>I bought this for two of my niece, they are into coloring hair, wearing custom hand made cute jewelry.</li>
      <li>Need more instructions????</li>
      <li>I would also advise to use it on hair that has not been shampooed that day so that it can absorb more color.</li>
      <li>so wasn&#x27;t sure how well these would show up.</li>
      <li>At first I laughed it off, but when I was asked to review this product, I thought why not give it a try.</li>
      <li>I found wetting the chalk and using it on dry hair worked best for me.</li>
      <li>These seem to work great for my 8 year old.  </li>
      <li>more precisely than say a spray can.</li>
      <li>And it washes out easily...</li>
      <li>so easy.  </li>
      <li>These work fine in all color hair.</li>
      <li>how artistic you may or (not!)</li>
      <li>Hair chalks are so much fun to add color and interest to my hair, and then be able to rinse it out.</li>
      <li>My niece and her friends really enjoyed the fun colors.</li>

      <li>These hair chalks are fun as they come in many colors and you can get the color on</li>
      <li>as obviously my feedback indicate it made them happy on getting a gift, but end of the day - will they use it often is something I doubt,</li>
      <li>Just cheap product .</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an okay hair chalk, nothing to really amaze me truthfully.</li>
      <li>It was fun for Halloween, though!</li>
      <li>These are so much fun!  </li>
      <li>They are a mineral that will wash out of your hair cleanly, just like the rest of a chalk stick will dissolve when it has reached the end of its usefulness.</li>
      <li>They are a mineral that will wash out of your hair cleanly, just like the rest of a chalk stick will dissolve when it has reached the end of its usefulness.</li>
      <li>Actually works as promised both of my kids love it, you need to add hair wax or hair spray to prevent it from getting on clothing and DEFINATLY wear gloves, but works great on dark and light hair!!</li>
      <li>I am not a young girl, but I knew these would be great fun in my household.  </li>
      <li>They were nice enough by being thankful to me and happy, but the actual reality is they don&#x27;t use it.</li>
      <li>My granddaughter also used some, but she went with many different colors and looked lovely.</li>
      <li>Her hair is pretty light blond</li>
      <li>So much fun.</li>
      <li>I was trying to use the light blonde on my medium brown hair and it worked okay.</li>
      <li>old aunt both ordered a box of these and love using them.</li>
      <li>Birthday success.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a fun product to use every now and</li>
      <li>The chalks are quick and easy to use and the colour is far more vivid that i thought it would be.</li>
      <li>It wiped right off my face and counters with a makeup remover wipe.</li>
      <li>Would be fabulous on blonde or grey hair, very intense, and great fuin for kids parties.</li>
      <li>These are so easy to use and the color will completely wash out with shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Also discovered on my own that where you apply the color does tend to dry out so be prepared to use conditioner.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is important, VERY important, that you spray your chalked hair with hair spray or other hair sealant to prevent it from drying out and working itself out of your hair.</li>
      <li>Huge hit, the colors are vivid, work well, wash off  skin and others surfaces.</li>
      <li>The directions were simple, the product worked so I am pleased to recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Well, if you have an artistic eye and a bit of patience, you have the chance to come up with the truly amazing thing about Second Glance Beauty&#x27;s Hair Chalks (SGBHCs, for short)</li>
      <li>colors are vibrant and fun and show up fully against the rest of my hair.</li>
      <li>Second Glance Beauty really has a lovely product here.</li>
      <li>Second Glance Beauty really has a lovely product here.</li>
      <li>They come off better when you wet them completely, but your hair needs to be pretty light to show the color.</li>
      <li>The only downfall is that they break easily.</li>
      <li>My only caveat is that they break easily.</li>
      <li>Good thing: clearly visible even on dark hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The only downside is that they crack very easily, so you will more than likely have multiple pieces of every color.</li>
      <li>If you follow the directions you can get really vibrant and pretty colors.</li>
      <li>and didn&#x27;t and my fingertips are now a lovley shade of pink :) though it soon wears off.</li>
      <li>yes that is the fun of getting old.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It took almost a whole chalk to get the shade I wanted throughout my hair.</li>
      <li>My Cincy BENGALS!\\&quot;, and so much</li>
      <li>My Cincy BENGALS!\\&quot;, and so much</li>
      <li>It came to me very well packaged.  </li>
      <li>It takes a while, but once you have achieved the desired look, gently brush the hair and then spritz it with hair spray.</li>
      <li>modern theatre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>have dark and very fine, flyaway hair</li>
      <li>Such a fun product to use no matter what age you are!</li>
      <li>Will try other colors to see if I get better results.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Having said that, I was invited to a cool event recently and needed to do something &amp;#34;special&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>They apply easily when you wet the chalk and apply.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not really what i expected.. it leaves my hair very ratty/snarly and it will get on anything it touches</li>
    <li> These work better than ANY hair chalks we have ever used!</li>
    <li> Like the wide variety of colors, but you really have to experiment to get enough color on hair.  I read a review that said &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; the sticks and that seems to help. Wear gloves when using them!</li>
    <li> These seem to work great for my 8 year old.  She loves them.</li>
    <li> bought these for my daughter. She has black hair so only certain colors work well for her. Definitely wet the hair and the chalk when applying, Overall, satisfied with the product</li>
    <li> I am not pleased with this product. I followed the directions and yet chalk still comes off on my hand. I won&#x27;t be buying this again. And I only gave 1 start because I had to. Not impressed</li>
    <li> Good thing: clearly visible even on dark hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad thing: impossible to spread evenly. Well, maybe possible if you invest an hour or so, but I&#x27;m just not that patient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall allowed me to have green hair for Halloween without much effort. Is a bit messy at first, but not after a couple of hours. I slept with the chalk on and the pillow didn&#x27;t get visibly tainted.</li>
    <li> My toddler loves for me to color her hair. These work great. Her hair is pretty light blond and they wash out almost immediately. If you follow the directions you can get really vibrant and pretty colors.</li>
    <li> Loved this hair chalk. I just received it after two days with only one broken piece (no biggie). I have dark Brown hair so I wet it, twisted it, and then used the blue chalk ( showed up great). Then I blew dried it a little, added hair spray and flat ironed it to set the color in. Be sure to use gloves because it gets everywhere. It wiped right off my face and counters with a makeup remover wipe. It looks great and all my friends want me to do their hair. Once you do your hair be sure not to touch it again.  I learned the hard way because I now have blue underneath my  finger nails :).  Would recommend and will reorder.</li>
    <li> This work for me!&lt;br /&gt;I used it to dye my hair without needing to resort to sprays and other scary unnatural stuff...&lt;br /&gt;If your are going to use this to color your hair you will need to use a lot of water!&lt;br /&gt;It takes some time until it starts coming off and going onto your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took almost a whole chalk to get the shade I wanted throughout my hair.</li>
    <li> Hair chalks are so much fun to add color and interest to my hair, and then be able to rinse it out. They are a little messy to apply, really do use gloves, but once on the hair the color didn&#x27;t rub off on my clothes or furniture, especially after I sealed them with a bit of hair spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are vibrant and fun and show up fully against the rest of my hair. I have brown and gray hair, I was worried this wouldn&#x27;t work on darker hair but it worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for review</li>
    <li> Definitely do not buy if you have dark hair.</li>
    <li> I have to admit that when I first heard about this product, I was a bit skeptical - kind of felt as though I would look like a clown if I put this hair dye on my hair, especially since a friend had bought some temporary dye (not by this company) and it was a disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I was invited to a cool event recently and needed to do something &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; with my hair and I thought of this product.  I have had positive experiences with their other hair products, so I thought I would try these out.  The result was amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These chalks are so easy to use - and they apply a beautiful color - no mater how artistic you may or (not!) be with a brush.  I experimented with a few different shade mixtures and it actually turned out great.  I even received a bunch of compliments on my &amp;#34;artistic hair&amp;#34; (if only they knew lol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a tad worried about removing the color afterwards, but wow! so easy.  The morale of this story??? If you use the right products (good quality) you will be happy with the results and I was.</li>
    <li> Not easy to apply, makes your hair brittle and tangled, and makes a HUGE mess. Not worth it!</li>
    <li> At some point in time, dying hair went from being a way to hide something (whether it is hiding grey hair or to contribute as a disguise to deceive someone in regard to your identity) and moved into the lucrative markets of entertainment and vanity. While these two can be intertwined, that would require a long history lesson, and I am sure that you are reading this review about the Second Glance Beauty Hair Chalks and not the development of modern theatre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, fast forward several hundred years, and suddenly world-famous musicians are no longer clean-cut guys and gals performing carefully choreographed dances on \\&quot;American Bandstand\\&quot;. Over time, artists like David Bowie, Madonna, Pink, Lady Gaga, all came to be known for their colorful hairdos. Well, if you have an artistic eye and a bit of patience, you have the chance to come up with the truly amazing thing about Second Glance Beauty&#x27;s Hair Chalks (SGBHCs, for short) your own masterpiece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using these chalks is the easiest thing that I have ever done. I am going to list the steps below, including my commentary, which made the entire experience simple and will help you should you decide to purchase the SGBHCs for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Things to get beforehand: rubber gloves, spray bottle with water, a comb, bottle of hair spray, towel, SGBHCs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Select the section of hair to be colored, spray with water. Also spray the chalk with water to help transfer the color.  Don&#x27;t press too hard, or you will snap the chalk. Resist the urge to rub back-and-forth. This is damaging to the hair. Be patient and rub firmly and you will soon see success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It takes a while, but once you have achieved the desired look, gently brush the hair and then spritz it with hair spray. Voila!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* When it is time to remove, just shampoo out in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Efficacy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is important, VERY important, that you spray your chalked hair with hair spray or other hair sealant to prevent it from drying out and working itself out of your hair. Chalk is a dry mineral, and like any power that you put onto any surface, if you have to find a way to keep it there or over time it will disappear. The good news, though? If you take this step early and maybe a rejuvenation spritz later on, your color will look gorgeous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the End&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part about SGBHCs is that they are chalk. They are a mineral that will wash out of your hair cleanly, just like the rest of a chalk stick will dissolve when it has reached the end of its usefulness. Second Glance Beauty really has a lovely product here. You have a palette of colors here to suit not just your makeup or outfit, but maybe your dog, or room, the logo of your favorite football team \\&quot;Who DEY!!

Chalk is a dry mineral, and like any power that you put onto any surface, if you have to find a way to keep it there or over time it will disappear. The good news, though? If you take this step early and maybe a rejuvenation spritz later on, your color will look gorgeous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the End&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part about SGBHCs is that they are chalk. They are a mineral that will wash out of your hair cleanly, just like the rest of a chalk stick will dissolve when it has reached the end of its usefulness. Second Glance Beauty really has a lovely product here. You have a palette of colors here to suit not just your makeup or outfit, but maybe your dog, or room, the logo of your favorite football team \\&quot;Who DEY!!

    <li> These work fine in all color hair. My daughter has fairly dark hair and all you do is rub it on the hair for a little longer and it will turn out fine. The only downside is that they crack very easily, so you will more than likely have multiple pieces of every color. Also, wear gloves because the color sometimes stain your skin.</li>
    <li> I used the set as instructed (apply to slightly damp hair) and the colors were vibrant and didn&#x27;t leave a gross texture on my hair. I have platinum blonde hair, so I cannot attest for how well they would show up on someone with dark hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to wash this out in the shower, and after shampooing my entire head extremely well twice and following that with a coat of conditioner, today (1 day later) the chunk that I applied one of the blues to still has a very faint tint of the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s only noticeable if you know where to look and it isn&#x27;t going to stop me from using them in the future, just proceed with caution and maybe don&#x27;t use it the day before you have a &amp;#34;grown-up&amp;#34; event.</li>
    <li> I bought this for two of my niece, they are into coloring hair, wearing custom hand made cute jewelry. I purchase as a gift hoping they will love it. They were nice enough by being thankful to me and happy, but the actual reality is they don&#x27;t use it. The color comes on hand a lot, the hair and hands both feel dry after applying the chalks. wearing gloves is recommended to avoid the dryness feeling. Regarding hair, the discomforting feeling could might vary from person to person, but from my perspective, I would look for a better product and will not recommend some to any of my friends. 3 star indicating product is ok? I&#x27;ll not say didn&#x27;t like it. as obviously my feedback indicate it made them happy on getting a gift, but end of the day - will they use it often is something I doubt,</li>
    <li> My nieces and I had a blast with these. They work well if you get them REALLY wet; this means they also get all over your hands, but that washes off easily enough. My only caveat is that they break easily.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t even comb my hair with this stuff in, stiff and ugly</li>
    <li> These hair chalks are fun as they come in many colors and you can get the color on more precisely than say a spray can. The colors were housed in a nice casing and were intact. Although there are many shades some are brighter than others. I have dark hair so some of the darker shades don&#x27;t show up on me. I used white and magenta/fuschia colors on my hair with ease.&lt;br /&gt;Wetting the chalk slightly and rubbing on dry hair strands works best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dark and very fine, flyaway hair so the chalk did make the hair feel rough and dry. It&#x27;s best not to run a comb through the hair after you&#x27;ve applied the chalk as it lightens the color. I wore it all evening without problem and it took some shampooing to get it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a fun product to use every now and then but every day use may not be the best for the hair. I would also advise to use it on hair that has not been shampooed that day so that it can absorb more color.</li>
    <li> Such a fun product to use no matter what age you are! colours are really vibrant on dark long hair and really easy to apply and wash out and didnt damage my hair. Would recommend for kids and adults.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t make them work, perhaps they are too hard?  Several were broken when they arrived.  Need more instructions????</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other hair chalks before and found that they were too powdery-- made a big mess and came off quickly. This is different-- the sticks are solid and you have to wet your hair and the sticks to get the color to really come out. (The directions don&#x27;t mention wetting the sticks, but that&#x27;s what works.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it a bit of a pain trying to color my hair and my daughter&#x27;s. I&#x27;m very dark brown, she&#x27;s blonde. In both cases, I had to go over and over the hair to get it to color, and it did leave our hair tangled and impossible to comb through, so the second time, I made sure to style first so I wouldn&#x27;t have to brush afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nice part is that the color does stay all day. It doesn&#x27;t easily come off onto clothing and hands as long as you do a little heat setting. And it washes out easily... both from your hair and skin. My daughter&#x27;s currently in school with three-colored streaks in her hair and she couldn&#x27;t be happier about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for review.</li>
    <li> They come off better when you wet them completely, but your hair needs to be pretty light to show the color. It was fun for Halloween, though!</li>
    <li> Messy, messy, messy! Be sure to use a towel or a barber&#x27;s cape while putting the color in your hair. Some of the colors are difficult to wash off of surrounding items.</li>
    <li> I accepted this product for an honest review and I&#x27;m glad I did.  I am not a young girl, but I knew these would be great fun in my household.  I have half brown, half white hair on my head, yes that is the fun of getting old. I have many allergies and cannot use hair dye, so I have been suffering with two tone hair.  My Granddaughter, who has used Chalks before, suggested that I try them to blend the color of my hair. Hum! At first I laughed it off, but when I was asked to review this product, I thought why not give it a try. I took the dark chalk and followed the directions. To my amazement as I continued to put it on it blended in with the rest of my dark hair. Wow! Who would have ever guessed?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listen, I know this product is mainly for the youth, but who says we older people can&#x27;t use it as well. My granddaughter also used some, but she went with many different colors and looked lovely. We both looked lovely! The directions were simple, the product worked so I am pleased to recommend this product. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> My 10 year old daughter got these, and they are fun to play with, but they are suuuuper messy.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected!</li>
    <li> These a very vivid hair chalks. They apply easily when you wet the chalk and apply. Wear gloves! The only downfall is that they break easily.</li>
    <li> I have black hair and it&#x27;s very hard to be colored even if I used the brightest color. After I applied the stick, my hair got very rough.</li>
    <li> I was trying to use the light blonde on my medium brown hair and it worked okay. Not amazing, but I know light over dark is tough. Will try other colors to see if I get better results.</li>
    <li> These are so much fun!  I&#x27;m a 70 year old who wanted to step outside the box and having blue, pink or turquoise hair for a day does the trick. The compliments are guaranteed.  These are so easy to use and the color will completely wash out with shampoo.  I read other reviews so knew to wash my hair before going to bed so that the color didn&#x27;t come off on my linens.  Also discovered on my own that where you apply the color does tend to dry out so be prepared to use conditioner.  After taking a selfie with blue hair my 57 year old cousin and 84 year old aunt both ordered a box of these and love using them.</li>
    <li> Some colors were better than others, but the majority of them were very difficult to get enough onto my hair so the color could be seen. Disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> Actually works as promised both of my kids love it, you need to add hair wax or hair spray to prevent it from getting on clothing and DEFINATLY wear gloves, but works great on dark and light hair!! It&#x27;s been a saving grace for spirit week!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve very dark brown waist length hair so wasn&#x27;t sure how well these would show up. I found wetting the chalk and using it on dry hair worked best for me. Take the warning to wear gloves seriously too - i was in a hurry ( as ever!) and didn&#x27;t and my fingertips are now a lovley shade of pink :) though it soon wears off. The chalks are quick and easy to use and the colour is far more vivid that i thought it would be. Would be fabulous on blonde or grey hair, very intense, and great fuin for kids parties. You can see my photos in the product image gallery showing just how intense the colour is when dry.</li>
    <li> It gets everywhere. I wish I&#x27;d gotten the spray stuff instead. I was washing it out of my skin for a week after Halloween and it was all over my pillows when after washing multiple times with redkens deep cleansing shampoo, still can&#x27;t get the blue stains out..</li>
    <li> These are the best!  I color my hair each day according to my outfit.  The color washes out easily and goes on perfectly.  So much fun.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay hair chalk, nothing to really amaze me truthfully. I&#x27;m planning to use these with cosplay. I just wish there was a bit more of the chalk.</li>
    <li> This is an awful product. It does not work as advertised. It&#x27;s hard to use and the color does not transfer well onto the hair.  Will definitely not repurchase!</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my niece as part of her 11th Birthday gift. Huge hit, the colors are vivid, work well, wash off  skin and others surfaces. My niece and her friends really enjoyed the fun colors.</li>
    <li> Just cheap product . Makes hair feel gross and Is out in hours</li>
    <li> Even following directions, these hair chalks do not work. Very dry, hard chalk - not at all the type used in beauty shops.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift included in package of fun products for a teen.  She loved it. It came to me very well packaged.  Birthday success.</li>
