<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The mirror I received is sadly un-enchanted and fogs up horribly. I didn&#x27;t use any cleaning products on it. It mounts nicely on the shower wall, but the whole fogging up thing just blows.</li>
    <li> What can I say? This product is your average plastic composite oval shaving mirror. Worth the price but nothing special or super anti-fog. If you don&#x27;t want it to fog, run it under the shower water before you use it. No more complex than that. No &amp;#34;anti-fog technology.&amp;#34; The mounting hook is sticky and hasn&#x27;t come loose yet after 1.5 months. Ok product.</li>
    <li> This mirror was easy to install, and works really well. When humidity gets to a certain level, it can fog up. But, simply rinsing it quickly under the water refreshes the surface, and it provides a very clear reflection. I&#x27;m glad to finally have a mirror for shaving in the shower!</li>
    <li> I just got this last week and so far I love it. It really doesn&#x27;t fog up at all!</li>
    <li> Excellent customer service and great product!</li>
    <li> Generally, these things start to get cruddy over time so we&#x27;ll see, but so far I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Have had this shower mirror for 2 weeks and it fogs. Sorry, I had high hopes for this thing but like all other shower mirrors it just can&#x27;t resist the steam. That said, the price is relatively low and on point with other shower mirrors (who don&#x27;t necessarily tout the same promise of being fogless) so I can&#x27;t complain about that. I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it had it cost more. All in all, it&#x27;s fine for just a run-of-the-mill shower mirror. I will say that the hook it comes with is fairly permanent (comes with a sticker on the back of the hook), but the mirror just hangs on that without IT being affixed to the wall, so it&#x27;s quite easy for me to just pull off the mirror and run it under the water to clear it off again then hang back up again. Prior to purchasing this I had been looking at other more permanent mirrors, and I&#x27;m glad I actually bought this one instead for the simple reason that the fog is easily remedied!</li>
    <li> Stayed fogless through my first shower.  If I wipe bar soap on my fingers and wipe the mirror it stays fogless.</li>
    <li> My regular mirror has less fog than my fogless mirror</li>
    <li> Thank you for reading my review. I love this product! I was able to install it in a matter of a few minutes, following the easy to read instructions that are enclosed in the box. It is great for men and women to use. Men for shaving of course and women for checking to make sure we get all the residual makeup etc off as we shower. I personally find this very convenient to avoid the dreaded raccoon eye. It is definitely fog free, and I think it should remain like this as long as I follow the instructions. I would recommend this as a great addition to any bathroom.</li>
    <li> When I first used this mirror, I was experiencing problems similar to some of the poor reviews here. I got an email from the manufacturer, and told them of my problems. The mirror was fogging immediately, and the image was kind of poor, even with the shower off. I had followed all the instructions and was ready to return it. They immediately offered to replace it, but I declined.    Fortunately, my wife discovered that there was still a clear plastic film on the outside of the mirror. It was practically impossible to see it, but \\&quot;scratches\\&quot; showed up on the mirror with it still attached. If you are having problems, make sure you remove this film. There was a sticker on the front that said it should be removed, and the sticker came off easily, but apparently it was referring to the film. The film on the back had a paper backing, so it was obvious that it had to be removed.    With the film removed, the mirror stays fog free, even without heating it in the shower. I have it positioned on the side where it does get sprinkled with water, but even that does not cause it to fog.    I gave it 4 stars instead of five, because the instructions were unclear (I read them carefully), and it is kind of ugly looking with no frame. It is just a cut out piece of plastic. However, it does do the job well, and stays clear while I shave.</li>
    <li> Works Great.  The adhesive hook is a plus for tile showers!</li>
    <li> I was excited when I was given the chance to review this product! I recently tried the Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror, which claims that it can help you to achieve a perfect, flawless shave every time and will never fog up on you. Me being a girl and all I do NOT shave my face LOL, but the mirror is still handy to have. I’m the type of person that needs to see what I’m doing; when I’m washing my face I do it in front of the mirror to ensure myself that I&#x27;m getting everything off, including that pesky eyeliner that works wonderfully ^_^ Let me tell you that this mirror works!! Yes it does! It passed my steamy shower test because not once did it fog up. This mirror truly lives up to its name! AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: DO NOT clean the product with Windex or any other cleaning product because this wipes off the fogless technologyfrom the mirror!</li>
    <li> This definitely fogs in the shower..  I think there might be a way for it to not fog, but it is too much work.  If I really need to use it as a mirror, I could run it through the shower to warm it up.  It is still there because I don&#x27;t know how to removed the fixtures.  Maybe I should start taking cold showers.  Maybe not.</li>
    <li> First of all I do like this mirror more than others I have bought but I also agree with other reviewers that it is not fogless as advertised.  After I rinsed it with water for the first time, it fogs every time I use it and has to be rinsed several times during shaving.  I do not take a hot shower where it steams the shower up.</li>
    <li> Disappointing.  Didn&#x27;t last very long as far as the &amp;#34;Fogless&amp;#34; claim.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband to use. We both had high hopes for this. We read all the reviews and really felt the good outweighed the bad. Oops, our mistake. It did well the first time we used it. The second time it fogged up and no matter what we do it fogs up. We are going to have to buy an anti fogging product to coat it with. The mirror itself is ok, but worthless for inside the shower. DO NOT BUY. Waste of money and we are still going to have top pour more money into it!</li>
    <li> Did not work for me. I had to Rub some soap on it to make it work at all. I have a small shower so matbe its me. But did not work so well.</li>
    <li> Works great, easy to hang and was reasonably priced. Additionally, the company has a culture of strong customer service. This is the one to get.</li>
    <li> Works great, just shaved in the shower this morning. They also email detailed instructions to make sure you get the most out of your new mirror, great customer service</li>
    <li> Fogged up within a minute. Works if you keep your curtain open but then you have water all over the floor.</li>
    <li> Fogs up every shower. Followed the directions exactly but no luck. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> The hooks that came with the product are nicer than the product! The mirror is good sized and very accessible. It isn&#x27;t completely fog proof.</li>
    <li> It is hard to keep this mirror clean. It also does fog in the shower, but you can use it after you give it a wipe with your hand. I would not buy it again but I would not not recommend it to someone. Seems ok.</li>
    <li> This mirror was working great when we first bought it. However, I used a paper towel to wipe it thinking that would be soft enough for its &amp;#34;special coating&amp;#34;. Ended up totally scratching it and so it has these huge scratch marks across it. Also, after that it started fogging up in the shower. Fiance still uses it though for shaving; just has to wipe the steam away.</li>
    <li> Works great. No fog at all. Make sure you keep the cleaning products off of it and it will do exactly what it says. Best one I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> item delivered on time, and was as described</li>
    <li> Worked great at first. DO NOT use Windex or anything else on it. My wife cleaned it off and now it fogs up.</li>
    <li> it does fog up a little bit in the shower.  It is not what I expected.  A bit disappointed.</li>
    <li> After about three months it starts fogging up.  Try some WD-40 on yours when that happens.</li>
    <li> My husband is raving about this mirror after years of putting up with mirrors where he could hardly see his reflection.  Well worth a little higher price!</li>
    <li> I love the fog-less feature.  The magic coating really works.</li>
    <li> This is a miraculous product...as a man with a bad back, I no longer have to Lean over my bathroom sink with an aching back...I can stand up in the shower and have a crystal clear mirror with NO Fogging up! It is a perfect product for daily shaving...Jeff</li>
    <li> Good product, works great, love the size of the mirror</li>
    <li> I recieved this product on friday and promptly placed it in my bathroom. I love it, you can see perfectly, even in the steamiest showers. The men love it, now they can shave in the shower better. I love this. This is a great buy for a great price.</li>
    <li> It is very simple; it works exactly as advertised. I am pleased that I have it.</li>
    <li> Fogs just as much as my normal bathroom mirror.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Fogs up right away. I am so disappointed. I really was hoping for a mirror that didn&#x27;t fog.</li>
    <li> This item is being sold as a &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirror, which leads the customer to assume that the mirror will not fog in the shower. This, however, is not the case. The mirror gets foggy as quickly as any other mirror. The only reason I gave it two stars is that it is easy to hang, and the included razor hanger is a nice touch. I will be returning the mirror as soon as I find an adequate replacement.</li>
    <li> Very high quality right out of the box.  Easy to install.  Slick design, looks great, and so far, completely fog free!!!</li>
    <li> No fog is true and it is very clear and a good size. I would prefer it came with suction hangers instead of adhesive mounts.</li>
    <li> This is the third and the least expensive &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirror I have purchased. It actually works! No fog at all after 3 weeks of use. It still collects water droplets from being directly under the shower, and I wonder if a little Rain-X might help, but I could not be more pleased at this point.</li>
    <li> First, I wasn&#x27;t sure about the &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; part. The mirror is plastic like with a kind of gel like coating.  The gel coating keeps it from fogging and it really works.  I tend to rinse it with each use, but don&#x27;t really have to put it under the shower spray.  The gel really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, I wasn&#x27;t sure if a non-glass mirror would be sharp and clear.  This really works.  The gel coating or the shiny surface does really give a bright and sharp and crystal clear reflection... even in a hot shower.  The mirror really does the job.  I have shaved in the shower for years and this is the best solution I have seen.  I have had before, glass that cracked and shiny plastic that broke into shards that were dangerous.  This panel is not something that seems breakable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, doesn&#x27;t fog, has a really bright and clear image, plus I don&#x27;t see how it can break.  Perfect solution</li>
    <li> Lightweight, smart and practical.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the razor holder as well and recommend the same.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again...</li>
    <li> The mirror fogs up like all other mirrors, but it does stick well in the shower.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very please with the product.  Easy to install and exceptionally clear mirror.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Where has this little mirror been all my life??  This is without a doubt THE BEST shower mirror around!  It&#x27;s crystal clear even when taking a hot shower, and it will NOT fog up!  I did ask it one day, &amp;#34;mirror, mirror on the wall, who&#x27;s the fairest of them all?&amp;#34;  It said, &#x27;Michael&#x27;!!! Probably something the owner programmed in!!&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, try it, you&#x27;ll love it! Can&#x27;t beat the price and with Amazon Prime, two day shipping!! Thanks for this great product!!......Ron</li>
    <li> Edited, since it started fogging after two months.    I was initially impressed!  But the mirror began fogging routinely after two months.  I cleaned it with water only but that did not help.    I decided to try the ToiletTree fogless mirror (linked below) instead.  There&#x27;s a small tank behind the mirror that you fill with shower water, which keeps the mirror at roughly the same temperature as the shower.  This should prevent fogging.  I will review that separately after a month of use. [[ASIN:B003BQ6QXK Fogless Shower Mirror with Squeegee by ToiletTree Products. Guaranteed Not to Fog, Designed Not to Fall. #1 Selling and Ranked by Amazon Customers. (Silver)]]    Uninstalling this mirror was a bit of a task since it uses hooks intended to be permanent.  I took a Q-tip and liberally applied Goo Gone around all four corners of both hooks.  There was a slight gap between the razor hook and my shower wall, so I was able to really soak some Goo Gone into the adhesive sticker through that gap.  After about five minutes, I peeled it up from the bottom, using the razor hook itself for leverage.  It left very little residue and I used a bit more Goo Gone to finish it off.    The mirror hook was more difficult.  I installed it better originally, so there wasn&#x27;t any obvious gap between the adhesive sticker and the shower wall.  I still used Goo Gone, but then I had to wedge a putty knife under it and pry it up.  The hook itself pried off fairly easily, but it left almost the entire adhesive sticker behind on the wall.  With the hook gone, though, I was able to smear lots of Goo Gone on the adhesive, which helped.  I used my putty knife to scrape off much of the residue, and then I grabbed a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser to finish the job.    I cleaned the entire area with rubbing alcohol and installed my ToiletTree mirror in place of this foggy one.</li>
    <li> Workes as advertised. Love my new bath mirror.</li>
    <li> Amazing how clear the mirrow remains.</li>
    <li> Husband likes it and says works great.  I like it - no mess on sink!</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I shave my head so there is lots of shaving involved.&lt;br /&gt;It saves me getting out from the shower and getting messy again with foam etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not completely Fogless but quick splash of water from time to time clears the fog away.&lt;br /&gt;Happy enough to give it 5 stars :)</li>
    <li> I love the simple design and the functionality of this product. You have to be real careful with this product tho. You have to only rinse with water and never let any products settle on it. My son brushed his teeth in shower with a new spin brush and let tooth paste sprinkle on it. By the time I noticed the next morning the mirrors anti fog was damaged. it does not work properly now after a year but we still use it in the shower and wet it when it gets fogged up.</li>
    <li> This mirror does not work as advertised. The mirror fogs immediately and requires constant wiping. Even before I received the mirror, I received an email from the manufacturer that some of their units were defective. Unfortunately, I lost the email and realized that there is no direct way of contacting them to complain. If the supplier is aware of this problem then why does he ship them to customers ?</li>
    <li> it is the only one that really works</li>
    <li> as advertised.  easy to hang. easy to use.  wet hand swipe works well</li>
    <li> I have purchased this twice. The first mirror worked as advertised.  Virtually no fogging and no maintenance required. Unfortunately, cleaning supplies were used on it at some point and ruined it.  I ordered a replacement and was disappointed.  It fogged almost immediately.  A replacement was sent to me (although it took 2 weeks to arrive), and it too fogs.  Too bad because my first one worked so well.  Maybe they have changed how the mirrors are made?  I&#x27;m thinking or ordering another, but may not due to my most recent experience.</li>
    <li> Very easy to install and wash clean, stays fogless unless you have a long shower in small space, but just rinse it and as good as new.</li>
    <li> Occasionally fogs up, but easy to install and very useful.</li>
    <li> Looks really sleek and nice!</li>
    <li> Those that know me know I used to be horrible about shaving.  Seriously, it was bad.  So bad that when I finally did shave I would destroy a razor after one use.  Cutting through weeks of bristle is a task too tough for most razors.  One of the reasons for my slacking was the difficulty of shaving.  I had to get out of the shower, get in front of the steam covered mirror.  If I shave right away then the mirror is all fogged up and I’m getting cold while drip drying.  If I wait until I am the mirror are dry my face is also dry and painful to shave.  The trick was to shave in the shower, but that makes mirrors fog up that much quicker.&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing has been wonderful.  I look forward to shaving now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course the product lives up to its name.  Its so clear it actually startled me to use it.  Hey, who the hell is in the shower with me?  Oh, that is my face.  I’m not sued to seeing it while in the shower.  I used the product according to directions and my face has never been clearer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, attach this to the opposite wall than the shower head.  It doesn’t really make sense any other place but people are weird and might mess this up.  I would also recommend attaching the shaving razor holder right next to it.  The hooks attach easily and are stronger than anything else I’ve ever put up in there, including the shower rod.  Also, I’ve found that the razors pick up a bit of moisture while hanging there thus reducing friction while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to use the mirror as directed.  Take the covering off.  Hang up properly.  Do clean it every so often according to directions.  A little bit of film built up from the usual shower use and splashes.  A quick cleaning and my Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror was perfect once again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its not suggested on the packaging, but don’t be afraid to take the mirror down and hold it in your hand while shaving.  Thanks to the clear reflection I was able to get all parts of my face that I have a habit of missing.  No more embarrassing moments, finding out that I’ve missed a huge spot right by the ear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and plan on having a Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror as a permanent addition to all showers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(This product was provided free for review.)</li>
    <li> This mirror is not really fogless. What it is if you run it under hot water it will stay fogless for about 60 seconds. I shave my face and head in the shower so that means you have to rinse it off two times to get 2 minutes of fog free use.</li>
    <li> It works well but does fog up on occasion. I am not dissatisfied, but my expectations were a little high. Nothing else better from what I saw.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know that I would call it \\&quot;FOGLESS\\&quot;, it still fogs up but atleast now there&#x27;s a mirror in the shower and it keeps his hair from being all over the counter and sink.    UPDATE!: After my initial review, the thing continued to get foggier and foggier, now it seems that all the protective coating has come off and all it does is hang at the back end of the shower, not getting wet. When you touch it, it is almost sticky and you can&#x27;t see s*** out of it, $20 worthless décor.</li>
    <li> This product works great!  I prefer to shave in my shower and have never had a fog free mirror that worked worth a flip.  This stays absolutely clear, comes with a mounting hook, makes shaving in the shower clean and easy.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this mirror. I have had other shower mirrors that will not stay secured to the tile shower wall, this one will. When this mirror fogs slightly all one has to do is run hot water over the mirror and it turns out clean and fogless for the duration of the shower. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  Just follow the simple installation steps and the mirror will work as promised.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I have to agree with several of the negative reviews on this site. I bought this for my husband, and he was excited to use it initially due to the claim of being fogless. Things seemed to be working great, but after a week or so of use, the mirror started fogging up every time. We followed the cleaning instructions so I don&#x27;t know what happened, but it seems that the &amp;#34;nanotechnology&amp;#34; has some real issues.</li>
    <li> Does the job, Looks good. This should be marketed to other pregnant women,  finally was able to ensure all shaving got done ;)</li>
    <li> My husband loves this mirror in the shower.</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  This mirror stays fog free unless I&#x27;m taking an extended break from life (aka a long shower).  This mirror is far superior to the last mirror I bought.  While the last one was a bit more attractive--- at least I can shave without looking into a fun house mirror now!  No distortion or anything.  The razor holder is a nice touch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only suggestion as far as packaging-- the backside film that needed to be peeled off wasn&#x27;t very easy to peel off.  It was more like ripping paper off to the point where I thought I did something wrong.  However, I can&#x27;t subtract because of something stupid like that.</li>
    <li> Does not work at all.</li>
    <li> Okay, so it was GREAT while it lasted, it even comes with a little stand for your shaver and all.  Unfortunately the coating they put on it doesn&#x27;t last very long (a month maybe).    I am going to try an anti-fog product called \\&quot;spit\\&quot; on it.  Will update on the results.    If it DOES work, the product should state that the coating need to be refreshed, and you know...  Sell it with it.    UPDATE: Downgrading from 2 stars to 1 because of constant spam from company.    UPDATE #2:  I have gotten good at applying the \\&quot;spit\\&quot; product.  It last about a week for each application and seems to work well.  I listened to some of the reviewers of that product and apply it the night before, wipe it on evenly, then just splash some water on it when I take my shower.  This product should really ship with something like this.</li>
    <li> I ordered this mirror for my husband, he loves it. It is lite and looks pretty cool in the bathroom. Most of all it is not falling down, like my old one.</li>
    <li> 1, Reason why I chose :&lt;br /&gt;This is actually the third Fogless Mirror I’ve purchased this year.  I first bought higher price range model, around $25.  That only last less than two month.  So I decided to give a try on cheaper model, around $10.  According to other folks review and manufacture’s description, Mirror shouldn’t be foggy, but as soon as steam from hot shower comes near those mirror, it became foggy.  So, after the 2nd one, I thought it would be “you get what you paid for” and I stopped searching.  It was silly but I was putting foam soap on the mirror surface when I take a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper model came with gray paint on the back side of mirror (so mirror reflects image on front) and that paint started coming off due to hot shower was touching to the mirror sometimes.  So, eventually half of mirror became a clear plastic plate!  Then I was in need of fog less mirror again.  My search began then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve been using this for a little over 3 month now, and it’s still been fogless.  My wife and I are very happy.  In fact, since the first day, mirror never got fog.  As I was carefully watching its surface, hot water or steam gets on surface but just drops down without fog.  I’m sure there is a special chemical is used, but it really works well.&lt;br /&gt;You bring your shower head closer to mirror surface and give some steams.  No change.  Other mirrors I bought in the past became foggy then got cleared out.  This mirror doesn’t become foggy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another good thing which is a matter of product quality was, this mirror was composed by two elements mirror surface and back piece white plastic.  They are glued together.  It’s much better quality than cheaper models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2, like &amp; dislike :&lt;br /&gt;It’s very easy to install and Mirror size is fairly large.  It’s been 3 month and we haven’t found anything bad so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3, Recommend this product to :&lt;br /&gt;Folks who are looking for real fog less mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4, Price :&lt;br /&gt;I paid $15 and it’s worth the money.</li>
    <li> this did not work. the mirror started to fog within a couple of weeks of use</li>
    <li> The only time this mirror was fogless was when it arrived in the mail.  Get it near any steam, i.e. like the hot shower that it claims to be designed for, and it fogs right up.</li>
    <li> Worked for a few showers but now fogs up. I  wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This mirror works exactly as described. The mirror never fogs and I actually have a better looking beard because I have a much better view when I shave.</li>
    <li> Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror is a mirror (not glass) that you can hang in your shower.  It is great for shaving, washing, teeth brushing, and many other showering tasks.  Cassani  uses an  Anti-Fog Nanotechnology on the mirror to repel fog, and it really works!  The mirror does not fog, even in the hottest shower conditions, and the mirror is a good size for any shower. I was excited when I received this mirror, because I have never had a mirror in the shower before. My shower is surrounded by glass, with room for a bench, and this mirror looks very nice in there.  This oval mirror is very lightweight and is not made of glass, so it is safe.  It  comes with a  stainless steel hook for hanging and another for your razor.  The  hanging hook is very sturdy, yet the mirror is easily detached from the hook so you can take it with you for travel or just in the house.I have this mirror hanging in my shower and I just love it.  It is so easy now to wash my face in the shower and  now I can see what I am scrubbing! I can also now see to moisturize in the shower...and let the steam soak inThe Fogless Shower Mirror by the Cassani Company is a terrific addition to my shower and has become part of my regular routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;xx - Christine</li>
    <li> Works great. No fog at all. Very light and somewhat cheap looking but very functional.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  Great product and i would certainly recommend.</li>
    <li> The mirror is large and clear.  However, it fogs up rather quickly.  However, I&#x27;m not entirely sure it is the mirror itself or the environment it is in.  It is slightly close to the shower stream - maybe a foot away.  However, it is mounted on a tile wall.  In a bathroom above a garage.  On an exterior wall.  In the winter.  The wall is very cold, so I&#x27;m not sure how well any mirror will do sans that one that you fill with water.  My previous mirror was a smaller suction cup model that I always wiped down with soapy water and my fingers before using.  It had soap scum accumulated on it so this replacement was needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can take the mirror down and run it under hot water as directed.  This helps for a minute or so at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, there is a &amp;#34;remove this&amp;#34; sticker on the back of the mirror.  I don&#x27;t know if it means to remove the sticker or the paper backing.  The paper backing just won&#x27;t come off, so both the sticker and the backing is staying on for now.  I&#x27;m not sure if that is causing any issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sticky mounting solution does seem to work well.  I just wish it didn&#x27;t fog up on me.</li>
    <li> high quality, nice looking, and works like a charm.  How did I ever do without it?</li>
    <li> Just awful, purchased this a couple months ago but haven&#x27;t had the chance to review this mirror.  Fogs up insatiately and is completely useless - to the point were i even forgot i still had it in my shower.  The hook works great- to bad it can&#x27;t reflect my reflection on it.</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for a friend and they were very happy with it would purchases another one for someone</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not fogless, but it&#x27;s also not hard to wipe it off. The suction holds, which is a bigger win for me. It&#x27;ll do. I&#x27;m also pretty sure I can buy a cream to make it fogless if I cared that much. But I don&#x27;t. My husband can now shave in the shower and make sure he didn&#x27;t miss a spot, which was my primary objective. It&#x27;s worth what I paid.</li>
    <li> excellent product, works as advertised!</li>
    <li> Fogs up every time im in the shower. Doesn&#x27;t matter how steamy the room gets. Have to constantly splash hot water on it to clear the fog</li>
    <li> This thing fogged up within 30 seconds of turning on the shower the first time I used it (and every time since), so I wouldn&#x27;t describe it as &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s a light weight mirror that cleans up nicely if you just splash some water on it. The company&#x27;s recommendation is to never clean the mirror with cleaner sprays which leads me to believe it&#x27;s &amp;#34;fogless nanotechnology&amp;#34; is simply a spray-on protector that will easily wipe off if you use 409 or something similar.</li>
    <li> Amazing best mirror got 3 of these, better than the $50 one I have.... trust me buy this u won&#x27;t regret it at all..</li>
    <li> My only guess here is that there are numerous typos in the product description and packaging and this is actually a Frogless mirror. If that&#x27;s the case, 5 stars, because after a month of usage I&#x27;ve encountered exactly zero frogs in this mirror. A 100% frogless mirror that gets extremely foggy when exposed to warm moist air.</li>
    <li> Works well so far, very light and easy to take off the hanger and clean.</li>
    <li> I have to admit, the fogless shower mirror actually works.  It never fogged up during the entire shower.  I even tested it to its max by turning the shower up to its hottest setting and filled it up with steam.  The mirror never fogged even under these conditions.  My shave was much more comfortable and much easier because of this product.  I’m glad I have it now and I’m sure you will as well.  Find my review of the product on my blog here:  http://healthmoneygolf.com/2015/01/27/cassani-fogless-shower-mirror-a-perfect-shave-everytime/</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this product in the mail.  Hung it up last night waited overnight to hang the mirror and it fell right down after my first shower.  Also, the mirror was let&#x27;s say 50% fogless.  I wish I would of read more reviews prior to buying.  The quality of a $5 mirror...</li>
    <li> Great item.  Exactly as described&lt;br /&gt; Slow processing and shipping. But a great product. If they processed and shipped the order faster this would be 5 stars.</li>
    <li> As soon as the Fogless Shower Mirror came in, I took it and put it up in my shower. To test this product i turned on my shower, only using hot water, and i shut the door. I let plenty of time for steam to build up in the bathroom. 30 minutes after I turned the shower on, I went to check on the Fogless Shower Mirror. When I went into the bathroom, my regular mirror was fogged up and the door was wet from the steam. I had hung the Fogless Shower Mirror up inside the shower. I was pretty surprised when i pulled back the curtain and there was not even the slightest hint of fog on the Fogless Shower Mirror. Overall i will be giving the Fogless Shower Mirror a 5 star rating!!</li>
    <li> Fogless like they said, very impressed</li>
    <li> It works great and  it&#x27;s simple to hang and gets the job done</li>
    <li> Works great.  No issues with it after a week or two of use.  The company emailed out instructions and information addressing some of the complaints noted in previous reviews.  They obviously are not just out to sell a product but seem to truly care about the customer and their experience.  Would happily buy another product from them, and am very happy with this mirror overall.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; part is misleading. You have to warm up the mirror so that it&#x27;s the same temperature as the shower to make it fogless. The downside is that it has a &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; coating so you can&#x27;t clean the mirror with windex and paper towels. If you do, the coating will scratch and make the mirror unusable. Instead, you can only use a squeegee to &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; it or keep the water spots from forming. Once you get water spots on there, it&#x27;s hard to get them off.&lt;br /&gt;The mirror was cheap though...</li>
    <li> Great mirror. However, the hook sticks permanently and cannot be moved. Perhaps a good suction cup would be better suited?</li>
    <li> Works just fine.  Only way it could work better is if it actually shaved my face while I doze in the shower.  Doesn&#x27;t fog and droplets easily removed.</li>
    <li> Followed all directions, never worked at all. Foggiest fog foggin mirror I&#x27;ve ever tried to use! No good.</li>
    <li> First I will provide the company’s product description:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHEST RATED SHOWER MIRROR FOR SHAVING: Our design, stainless steel hooks, and advanced technology leads the way in customer satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;INCLUDES STAINLESS STEEL RAZOR HOOK – The perfect addition to your new shower mirror, keeping your razor wherever you want it and always ready for action.&lt;br /&gt;ANTI-FOG NANOTECHNOLOGY – Our patented technology is infused directly into the reflective surface of the mirror to repel fog, leaving you free to focus on getting the perfect shave… everytime.&lt;br /&gt;NEW MODERN DESIGN! – OPTIMAL VIEWING – Our improved modern design was voted on by thousands of customers.

Detachable Fogless Mirror is ideal for home or travel use – Hassle-Free 100% Money Back Guarantee if you are not fully satisfied.fogless mirror&lt;br /&gt;Now, I will give you my opinion.  I really like this mirror!  I mean really, really like this mirror!  I have tried using other mirrors in the shower but haven’t been able to because they fog up! My husband hasn’t been able to find one that enabled him to see while shaving.  This mirror honestly does not fog up.  I, personally, like my showers warm and comfortable.  My husband likes his scalding hot and comes out looking like a lobster!  The mirror did not fog up during either type of shower!  The reflection is also clear and not distorted.  I was surprised about that but I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little Extras&lt;br /&gt;The Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror comes with a hook for the mirror and a hook for a razor.  I know this may not seem like a big idea but I love convenience and this hooks make it easy to hang the shower and be able to easily grab your razor.  I don’t have to worry about bumping it with my elbow and falling to the floor.  If it’s in the floor, I willstep on it!  Maybe you can see why I like the fact the razor can hang from the wall.  I didn’t think the hooks would stick because you just unpeel the backing and put on the mirror wall.  So far, so good!  The hooks are staying up through multiple showers so far.  The mirror and hooks are not heavy so that may be part of it.  Regardless, they do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Sink Is Clean!!&lt;br /&gt;I cleaned my sink two days ago and it’s still clean!  There are no little hairs from my husband’s beard messing it up.  Ladies, you know it’s true.  You clean the sink, they shave.  With this mirror enabling my husband to shave while he showers, he no longer does it over the sink.  I’m a happy camper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I Mention The Price?&lt;br /&gt;Remember that this product has “nanotechnology” to keep the mirror from fogging.  Also, remember it works!  Are you ready?  $14.99!!!  Worth every penny in my opinion!  I’m really surprised they are selling this mirror for so cheap!  I’d pay that just for the clean sink!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Final Verdict&lt;br /&gt;I give this product 5 stars and I DEFINITELY recommend it!</li>
    <li> First, don&#x27;t expect magic from anything that claims to be fog proof. Like every other basic mirror, this one lasted two showers before fogging. Why 5 stars? For a basic mirror it works perfectly. Simply hold it in the shower for 15 seconds to warm up, and it lasts a full shave and more. It used a suction hook instead of the sticker one. I keep it turned backwards when not in use so that it doesn&#x27;t get soap stains.  It is very light and won&#x27;t break if dropped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned the ShowerTek several times. It is the only one that stays fog free because water runs through it to match the shower temperature. It lasts from one year to 3 years before the flex tube will crack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this one is a better value.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my son&#x27;s shower, they love it.  They like to shave in the shower so this was a great solution.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work after about 9 months</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve followed all of the instructions included with this product.  In my shower, this mirror&#x27;s hydrophobic properties were substantially reduced after about a week of use.</li>
    <li> The mirror has hung in the shower for five month and has never fallen down.  It promptly lost it&#x27;s ability to stay fog-free.</li>
    <li> Out of the box this product has a 5 star rating.  Instructions tell you to clean it like you would your glasses NO CHEMICALS!  As mirrors are wont to do it got smudged after about 3 weeks worth of showers so I took it of its hook and rinsed it off under the shower.... got rid of the smudges right along with the anti-fog nano technology.  The technology is absolutely NOT water proof so it&#x27;s absolutely worthless in a shower.</li>
    <li> The Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror is perfectly shaped to fit your face and even comes with a hook for your razor! It’s sleek design will compliment any shower. They have thought of everything! Not only is it great for shaving, but for tweezing and pore cleaning in the shower!! A big plus – it is sized perfectly and durable enough for travel! LOVE it!! I give the Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror two thumbs up. I definitely would recommend this to my friends and anyone looking for a unique holiday gift! For more come find my site Malibu Mama Loves! Xx</li>
    <li> Arrived with deep scratch under cut protective film. Too expensive for thin piece of coated plastic.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good enough. But does fog over time.</li>
    <li> First unit I purchased fogged up after 3 showers so I decided to purchase another thinking it was defective. Second mirror had the same issue. I&#x27;m not sure where this reviews came from and how the company stimulated this many positive reviews, but I would recommend trying another brand or mounting a mirror with adhesives for half the price.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Mirror and razor holder are easy to install and foolproof. The product works like a charm, was priced right, and comes with a box that the guy looks is super happy to be shaving. Dont waste time shaving after you get out of the shower. You will get a better shave and save time by buying this mirror and shaving in the shower. Cheers.</li>
    <li> Not fogless, but it&#x27;s still a good mirror.</li>
    <li> This does not do what it claims.  It fogs up instantly.  Picture that smiling dork in the ad but through a thick layer of fog... suddenly his grin is upside down.  That&#x27;s me.</li>
    <li> I bought this product with much excitement, and it was great for about 1 or 2 months, until it started to fog up! I followed all directions on placement and cleaning, and it still fogged. I kept it up, cause I could still sort of see my face in it, but at the 6 month mark the mirror holder fell off and the mirror is no more! :(</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually review things unless they&#x27;re very bad or very good.&lt;br /&gt;This product is the latter.  It&#x27;s a cinch to install, the adhesive mounts&lt;br /&gt;are sturdy as concrete, and the mirror size is much larger than I&lt;br /&gt;expected.  Oh...and the best part is...IT WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;Buy this mirror, you will not be sorry.</li>
    <li> Worked well for two days, but on the third (this morning) it was no longer fogless.  Like other reviewers, I followed the strict instructions from the manufacturer (no cleaners, etc.) but it still fogged up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still giving it 3 stars (2.5 is more realistic) because it is a good mirror (size/shape/clarity), even with the fog.  And it is not a big deal to shave one handed, holding the mirror in the other, and drenching it periodically to remove built up fog.  While I wish it had stayed fogless, and that it had cost less,  I&#x27;m not sorry I tried it since I can still make it work.</li>
    <li> works great. stays crystal clear in the shower. no warming it up like other mirrors I have had. been using it for over a month now and its still perfect.</li>
    <li> It stays fogless for the first 10 minutes of a shower or so (depends on how long you like to shower). If you get to close to it and breathe on it while you are shaving, it fogs up pretty fast. This can be remedied by just wiping it off with your hand. Even if your hand is wet, it seems to reactivate the anti-fog technology. I will keep using it because it keeps my sink clear of hair and shaving cream, but its not flawless as advertised. I just expected more.</li>
    <li> It is a very simple mirror and I was expecting something with a frame but it is just a very lightweight mirror. It works great in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;If it does fog up I put some soap lather and rinse and it&#x27;s good to go.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but I felt compelled to share my experience with this product. I use this in the shower to shave my head and I&#x27;m 6&#x27;4&amp;#34; so I naturally had to hang this mirror quite high. It is on the side of the shower stall about 6&#x27;2&amp;#34; above the bottom of the tub and 30&amp;#34; from the shower head. It worked great at first but after a while it started &#x27;peeling&#x27; and eventually the coating peeled off and it became just another reflective piece of plastic. I can only surmise that the reason it peeled was because when it got splashed with water, I used my finger to &#x27;squeegee&#x27; it and my finger still had traces of soap and/or conditioner (used for shaving) which reacted negatively with the coating. If this is actually the case, I suggest that the coating on this product is far too fragile. I will be searching for another solution besides this product.</li>
    <li> I was sent this mirror to test out. It works great as far as not fogging up, and I questioned whether the adhesive would hold true or not, but it&#x27;s been up for over a week now, and holding fast! It&#x27;s a great mirror, and I can use it to apply makeup and do my hair even when the big mirror is all fogged up from the hot water.</li>
    <li> The product does not work. I have been using it for two weeks and it fogs up every time I use it. I run it in the shower water ,I leave it alone, it doesn&#x27;t matter.&lt;br /&gt;The hooks are good and it looks nice but its not worth it to me.</li>
    <li> The mirror works pretty well. Once in a while when its really cold in the shower and the water is really hot, the mirror will fog up slightly but holding it under water for a second remedies it for the wholelength of the shower.</li>
    <li> I have tried four or five of these fogless shower mirrors.  This one is the best, in my opinion. The only reason I did not give it five stars is I find the product a bit utilitarian; my guess is they do this for weight saving, but a little &amp;#34;finish&amp;#34; could go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews before purchasing and most complaints were for the product not sticking to the wall. If you follow the directions, this product works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Recommend. Your mileage may vary.</li>
    <li> Works as described, perfect in the shower</li>
    <li> Great pic, every time I look at it.</li>
    <li> Mirror does not stay clear or clean.  Despite the manufacturers claims I am unsatisfied with the purchase of this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror. Works as described and cost much less than others listed.</li>
    <li> So I love having it in the shower, convenient to shave with but mine always fogs...is my face to close to the mirror? Anyhow...still love it:)</li>
    <li> I love the stainless steel wall-mounts, especially the razor hook as I place&lt;br /&gt;it higher up to keep away from my kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the size of the mirror, great width so I don&#x27;t miss anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the mirror itself:  very clear and portable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does what its supposed to. Thanks Cassani!</li>
    <li> Works pretty well so far!</li>
    <li> Seems a little &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; when you first look at it, but it really does a nice job.  Glad I got it.</li>
    <li> My husband would normally wait until our mirror clears up after shower then shave but now that we have this Fogless Shower Mirrors it&#x27;s the best. No more waiting, he can shave right after taking shower. The best mirror indeed. Love it and we highly recommend it to everyone out there :D</li>
    <li> So far this works great!</li>
    <li> I have had this mirror for 2 months and when I received it I was not excited about the look overall, but knew that going in, and bought it based on the reviews being so positive. I&#x27;m pretty easy to please, but this has not held up. Initially it worked just &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; because every few seconds I had to throw water on it to remover the fog. Then slowly, over the next month and a half, a weird square pattern appeared and it spread over the entire mirror - making it virtually useless.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. It fogs all the time even when taking a hot shower.</li>
    <li> This mirror works as advertised! Easy to use and great for shaving in the shower.</li>
    <li> Good for about 2 weeks it  sucks</li>
    <li> This is okay and hopefully when we get it hung up, it will stay on the wall. The mirror itself is so lightweight, I would think the price would be way lower.  Product acceptable. Priced too high.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work. Its a good mirror but it does fog. If you just run some water on it it will work for a while.</li>
    <li> the first couple of times it worked great.  since then mirror will fog up so I have to rinse with warm water and wipe with my fingers and it stays un-fogged just long enough to shave my beard.</li>
    <li> Uh oh.....seems to be clouding up more than expected. Probably will keep...threw box  away.  A little disconcerting.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Does what it says it will do. Trust that it will continue to do so. Best in-shower mirror I have had thus far.</li>
    <li> This mirror is disappointing, unfortunately. I got nervous when, before we even received the mirror, we received two separate emails from the seller with very specific instructions about how to care for it. Should it be hard to care for a mirror? I thought this indicated they must get lots of emails from folks for whom the mirror isn&#x27;t working. Now that we&#x27;ve used the mirror, that seems likely. If you take hot showers or longer showers (long enough to shave carefully, for example) the mirror isn&#x27;t fogless. Bummer.</li>
    <li> ****This item was sent to me for review****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror is the perfect fit for my shower.  I love the fact that it comes with a bonus holder for your razor.&lt;br /&gt;One of the main points that I love about it is that it hangs on a hook.  This means I can easily take it out of the shower and clean it.  You KNOW how things can get in the shower with soap and shampoo floating around.  It doesn&#x27;t fog up and is super helpful when I am washing my face to make sure I have all the make up streaks off my face!</li>
    <li> Works well enough for me so far.</li>
    <li> Works great. Our bathroom is very cold in the winter, so even though the mirror fogs up at the start of a hot shower,, all you have to do is swipe it off with the back a finger once in a while and it is instantly very clear again. Much better than all the other shower mirrirs I havee tried over the years.</li>
    <li> Awesome mirror. My hubby loves it!  Great Suze for our shower.</li>
    <li> seems to be well made.</li>
    <li> Had for a few days. Have to rinse in hot water every 30-45 seconds to keep from fogging. A simple piece of plastic for $15 bucks too. No nano technology about it.</li>
    <li> Good size, packed well, hasn&#x27;t fogged up after a couple of weeks.  The mount is adhesive, not a suction cup.  Be aware, the mirror itself simply hangs on the mount, it&#x27;s not fastened in any way.  It is secure, it won&#x27;t fall, it doesn&#x27;t twist, and it really doesn&#x27;t move; however, if you bump it, it will swing a little.</li>
    <li> Simple but functional</li>
    <li> This lil mirror is a good mirror. It will after some time in your shower start to fog. If u contact the manufacturer like I did they will offer u ideas to stop the inevitable but there ideas and instructions won&#x27;t work as well as mine. Just take ur hand held shower nozzle and run warm water over the mirror for a few seconds and shave your face.</li>
    <li> The size and easy placement in the shower is fine. The problem I have is that the mirror does fog up, and I constantly run water over it to clear the fog.... Not  Fogless as promised.</li>
    <li> Would just like to say that this should read, easily fogged mirror. Thought my product was defective, but they were not. The product just does not work. As a loyal amazon customer, I have advise my fellow amazonites, to stay as far away and to not be tempted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> The mirror started off to be a quality purchase but after about 2 weeks the mirror started to fog in the shower.  Now after about three months it is almost pointless to have in the shower.  Don&#x27;t think I would purchase this mirror again.</li>
    <li> It works great for me but beware if you take really hot showers... I often do and I find myself having to rinse it before using it!</li>
    <li> These reviews are getting less and less reliable. Came in all the right packaging and stuff. Used it and it stayed fogless for about two days, then it started fogging up. Worse, it doesn&#x27;t fog up like regular mirrors do. With regular mirrors you can just wipe off the condensation and it stays fairly clear for a few minutes. This one develops water break (the water clings to its surface in large pools) and it&#x27;s really hard to see. To be fair, I&#x27;ve experienced this with other &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirrors, so it may just be the chemical. My advice: just stick to a normal handheld mirror and run it under the water if it fogs up.</li>
    <li> I was really hopeful for this mirror in the shower. Mounting options are fine, but my 2nd shower it fogged up to the point of being unusable. Now it fogs up completely and immediately every shower. Not as advertised. Not sure if I can return it being mounted and all, just a bad product.</li>
    <li> So far it is great and works great.</li>
    <li> Cheap and functional. Purchased for wet shaving with safety razor. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I have purchased fogless mirrors like this before for the shower and they did not work at all. This mirror really does work however, I follow the instructions stating to hold it under the hot water for 5 seconds when you first get in and it stays fog free throughout my entire shower. This mirror is also slightly larger than the ones I have purchased in the past and I love that it is round (since that is the shape of your face). The hook for the razor is another added bonus because everything is right there where you need it.</li>
    <li> This works 100% as advertised. At first I thought it was small, but once in the shower, you stand so close to it that its plenty big and anything larger would be obnoxious (regardless of how large your shower is). That adhesive hook is the most substantial thing you could have to hold it on the wall, it ain&#x27;t going anywhere. I was also pleasantly surprised that It came with a razor holder mount that adheres to the wall as well. I have always shaved at the sink, and my wife has gooten on to me for years about the mess it leaves... switching tot he shower makes a world of difference... almost ashamed I didn&#x27;t switch earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is 100% fog free... I&#x27;ve seen other brands that people say its not fog free... this was my first choice, and does exactly as advertised. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Purchased in November and the mirror is already showing small/fine cracks all throughout and it fogs up as bad as any other mirror. Nothing special!</li>
    <li> Nice size and shape.  No fog after 1 week of usage.</li>
    <li> Fogged up immediately</li>
    <li> Worked for two weeks great, now just fogs up like any other mirror.</li>
    <li> Not very fogless.  I have to wipe it down constantly.</li>
    <li> Nice mirror.  Very stylish looking in my shower.  Holder seems strong - no issues after a week of having the mirror hung up.  Stays fogless or just a splash of water clears it off of shower mist.  Love that it&#x27;s frameless.  This is the clearest shower mirror that I&#x27;ve ever had.  I&#x27;m hopeful that it will stand up to the test of time - and the test of my cleaning ladies.</li>
    <li> Really like it. Does what it says!</li>
    <li> Works exactly as advertised. Great price. Totally satisfied.</li>
    <li> Works great, exactly as advertised.  The instructions indicate that it may be a little delicate, needs TLC, and may not last for the long term, but even if that is the way things work out it is worth it.  The image is very clear, it is easy to install, could not be more impressed even on such short acquaintance.</li>
    <li> Well,  the 1st 2 weeks were fine but now fogs up w/in 2mins of turning on the shower 😥😁</li>
    <li> Great product!!  Just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> Mirror is great looking with included hook, BUT, it&#x27;s anything but fogless..  Immediately fogs up..  instructions say to run under water for 20 seconds...  do that...  mirror stays clear for a few minutes...  fogs up again.  rinse and repeat....&lt;br /&gt;it is a very clear mirror when not foggy...  installation was easy..  but it still fogs up..</li>
    <li> Began to fog up after a month or two. Cleaned it with just water like they said, still happens. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> The mirror fogged up with the first shower. Hard to look into</li>
    <li> Easy to install. Much better than suction cup version s that fall and break</li>
    <li> This mirror is NOT fogless. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Total bust. I used a cheap (less than $10) shower mirror for years and only got rid of it after it literally fell apart. I bought this one because of the high ratings, but it just doesn&#x27;t work. I have tried multiple locations in the shower to no avail - it fogs up within minutes. I would much rather fill up a cheap mirror with hot water if it stays fogless.</li>
    <li> This product works exactly as advertised and looks great hanging in the shower. I think the key was the simple design and the strong adhesive that holds a free hanging mirror. I have tried similar products in the past that used a suction cup and I can honestly say that this adhesive method seems much more effective. The razor hook is also simple and effective and uses the same adhesive to hang from the shower&#x27;s interior. The stainless steel finish really looks great with the border-less mirror in any bathroom. Now all I can do is wait to see if it stands the test of time. UPDATE: 04/09/2015 Unfortunately, this product did not retain its value. It is still &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; but the mirror fills with condensation to the point where I can&#x27;t shave anymore.</li>
    <li> Fogs up despite following care instructions. Very disappointed in this thing. I went with the mirror that you fill up with the warm shower water. Takes 2.5 extra seconds but the mirror is 100% fog free.</li>
    <li> Works just as it should and without the high price of other fancy shower mirrors that can never deliver on their fogless promise.</li>
    <li> They promised they would send me a new one. It never worked out the box.  Garbage.  Don&#x27;t believe the fake reviews here.</li>
    <li> This mirror is great. You just run it under the water to get it warm and it&#x27;ll stay fog free for my whole shower. might need to run it under the water again after a half hour or so but its still great and clears up perfect every time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s plastic,and supposedly fogs less!! Not true. I&#x27;m very disappointed. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Save your money and the hassle of returning - it does not work.  It fogged up the second day of use and unfortunately hasn&#x27;t worked since.</li>
    <li> This replaced another &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirror I had that fogged up too much. What a difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The adhesive it uses to stick to the shower wall is very strong, unlike others that use a suction cup, so there&#x27;s no risk of the mirror falling down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Includes a razor holder, which is super convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Actually doesn&#x27;t fog up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Once you place it, it&#x27;s a big deal to move it again. This is not a major concern, and having a mirror that stays firmly in place is more important to me than being able to move it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very happy with this mirror and despite the very slight inconvenience of not being able to move it easily after you&#x27;ve placed it, it still deserves a five star rating.</li>
    <li> Works well and is great for the shower.  Saves me time getting ready for work.</li>
    <li> We had heard such great things about this mirror but when we installed it we did not have that experience.  My husband was able to use it to shave once and everytime after that the mirror has been completely fogged up.  We might has well put a normal mirror in there because I cannot see anything. We carefully read the directions and installed it as directed but sadly no success.</li>
    <li> Best shower mirror to be found. Looks nice, hangs on a hook so it can be easily taken down for use. Supplier shipped quickly and emailed instructions on care of the mirror. Really doesn&#x27;t fog up . Good product would buy again and from the seller again</li>
    <li> Perfect size. Works exactly as advertised. Love that it has the hole for attaching a rope hanger.</li>
    <li> Pretty solid item for the price and works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Here is a tip for people purchasing this mirror and finding that it&#x27;s a bit hazy and fogs up immediately (I&#x27;ve seen a few reviews stating this). Remove the protective reflective coating that covers the actual mirror surface. It took me about a week to figure this out. It&#x27;s applied smoothly with no wrinkling or air bubbles, fits the mirror surface perfectly evenly and has a reflective surface, so it&#x27;s not nearly as obvious as you&#x27;d think. There was a sticker that stated &amp;#34;Please remove&amp;#34;. That&#x27;s good thinking. However, placing it on the *back* of the mirror that goes against the shower wall instead of on the front on top of the actual protective coating that needs to be removed was not the best in package engineering. Now that the mirror is protective coating free it works great. And a good value for the price.</li>
    <li> What a joke. The mirror (No matter how clean it is per the company&#x27;s instructions) fogs up within two minutes of being in the shower. Do not buy this unless you need the razor holder that accompanies the mirror.</li>
    <li> Have had this product since late October 2014, it fogs up EVERY TIME I take a shower now. Save your money. The item is on the other side of my shower head, it doesn&#x27;t get hit at all by water.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. Water accumulates on the mirror (not necessarily fog, but droplets. I have to wipe it down occasionally while in the shower to get a good view.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Shaving in the shower &#x3D; life changer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, their customer service is top notch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people don&#x27;t seem to understand how to use the product.  Simply get it wet while you&#x27;re showering (as per the instructions) and it won&#x27;t fog up.</li>
    <li> My husband shaves in the shower, this was a great replacement for the ancient one he had been using. He&#x27;s been using it for about a month, no problems.</li>
    <li> Mirror is not fogless.  It works exactly like a normal mirror placed in the shower would.  I&#x27;m sending it back for a refund.</li>
    <li> Fogged up on very first use</li>
    <li> Works great so far! No complaints.</li>
    <li> Works great -- never fogs and cleans easy with a rinse of water in the shower. Comes with a nice hook for the razor too.</li>
    <li> Nice little mirror, but the stick tape on the holders is very poor. Cleaned the shower wall as directed, but the next day the mirror and razor holder were on the floor.</li>
    <li> I recieved this mirror as a product test, hung it up in my shower, and after further review I can honestly say, it does what it is supposed to. I like my showers HOT, and this mirror does NOT fog up. It aslo works great for shaving, and making sure all the shampoo is out of your hair... I like to use it to remove my eye makeup in the shower. This mirror would certainly be a good buy for males looking for a shaving mirror. The hanger works great, and sticks really well. Withstands the test of time- and HOT showers! Thank you Cassani Company!!</li>
    <li> It works as advertised and I have never had it fog up when using. I prefer to hold it when shaving using the circle opening. Suggestion - for people who normally wear glasses - older customers - , a unit that has a magnification would be helpful.</li>
    <li> Nice mirror. Works well in the shower.</li>
    <li> Perfect for shaving in the shower. Easy to install. Just run it under some water and you are ready to go.</li>
    <li> So far so good, have not had it fog up at all! Its nice to have it clear and ready to go when i start shaving!</li>
    <li> Great addition to my luxury shower suite!  Crisp clear fogless mirror to shave by. Lightweight and easy to install. Negative reviews appear to be from those who lack basic common sense, just saying...</li>
    <li> Works as advertised and a lot better than the one I got from Macy&#x27;s. Easy hookup. Can recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror.  The first one I owned lasted for many months.  As the directions say, rinse with your hand only.  But after a long while the calcium from the water will build up and it needs to be replaced.  However this one is well worth it.  I bought another brand that was $4 cheaper just to see and it lasted for 2 weeks.  I immediately bought this mirror again.  They really do last the amount of time in the shower.  Thank you for an amazing product!</li>
    <li> Just as product describes. Make sure to only rinse with water if &amp;#34;cleaning&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 year update: chemical applied doesn&#x27;t last. we have to buy a new mirror because it fogs up now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. It would be great if had a couple of extra glue pads for the eventuality of moving to another house. It just happened to me and I haven&#x27;t been able to use it since then. Other than that, great product.</li>
    <li> Not having high hopes for this. All plastic, right away got an eMail with &#x27;care&#x27; instructions. Will see how this think will hold up. However, this unit will be put to good use, as backer for next mirror. My next shower mirror is a real mirror, off an truck in the junk yard. All this plastic BS got me sick, can&#x27;t use a real cleaner on them nor scrub a little. lol</li>
    <li> This mirror has an extremely clever physical design. Unfortunately, it isn&#x27;t fogless. Let me amend that: it was fogless on the first day, mostly fogless on the second day, a quarter fogless on the third day (pictured), and soon it wasn&#x27;t fogless at all.</li>
    <li> Excellent applies to my experience! Arrived sooner then expected, received a email from Cassani prior to it&#x27;s arrival with mounting and care instructions ( also included with mirror). Mounting the mirror and razor holder was easy. I love it!</li>
    <li> It fogs up just as quickly as a normal mirror. Not really worth it other than to have a mirror that hangs easily in your shower</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very functional, does just what I need; it works as advertised. Only drawback is that I bought it for travel and it doesn&#x27;t come with a suction cup hook.</li>
    <li> Working great so far after about a month and some change. Much cheaper than in some of the stores also. I like it.</li>
    <li> Started out great. I was relieved. Within a month, it had become unusable. I have to constantly spray it down to get the fog off, several times throughout the shower. Looking for a replacement. I have adhered to all of the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions.</li>
    <li> Fogs up when showering... Thought it was supposed to be &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34;...</li>
    <li> The mirror itself is great but I am having trouble with the hook staying attached to the wall. It keeps coming unstuck :( I wish they&#x27;d send extra replacement sticky parts for cases like this... and I wish it didn&#x27;t keep falling in the middle of the night and scare the crap out of me  @_@&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: The last redeeming part of this purchase was lost when this thing stopped being &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; after a few months, really disappointing, especially after I&#x27;d purchased a new suction hook to replace the crappy sticky hook they included. Considering my last shower mirror lasted me almost a decade and for the same price, this has been a complete waste of money. I don&#x27;t know where the 5-star reviews are coming from, seems insane that this is working for anyone?!</li>
    <li> I love this little mirror. The installation is so simple. The mirror attaches to a little metal hook by simply placing the hole in the mirror onto the hook. Now the hook itself has an adhesive so you press firmly onto the tile. I place the mirror at eye level so I have a better view of washing my hair no longer missing those soapy spots and conditioner sitting on my scalp. As for the fogging up..IT DOESN&#x27;T. I am the steam shower queen and this mirror has never fogged up on me. There is another piece of this product that you can use to hold razors. It also is self adhesive and sticks on to tile.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was well done and I am very happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was sent to be for an honest view.</li>
    <li> Awesome little mirror.  Very light, doesn&#x27;t fog and inexpensive.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My fourth mirror in a few months and finally one that is perfect. Others, more expensive, had problems. One kept wiggling in the shower. draft. Others kept getting fogged up another had a case that made use difficult. This one has absolutely no fog and is just the right size and shape.</li>
    <li> Initially we thought this fogless mirror was disappointing as it fogged up from the first use... however after two weeks in the shower, I discovered that my boyfriend had failed to take the plastic cover off of it. Embarrassing but true and now the mirror truly is fogless! Better yet my boyfriend now shaves in the shower so our bathroom counter isn&#x27;t covered in little just shaved off hairs three times a week anymore!!!</li>
    <li> it fogs easily when in the shower, but can be cleared by washing off the mirror before use.</li>
    <li> THESE ARE THE BEST - BOUGHT 3 SO FAR!</li>
    <li> The first mirror I got started to fog almost immediately, but it was only in small patches. I requested a replacement, which I received without a problem, but it also had similar effects (again, it wasn&#x27;t the whole mirror); I figured that perhaps this was normal, since it had happened to both my mirrors, and I could still see the central part. However, about a week later, the entire mirror began fogging up within couple minutes of turning the shower on, rendering the mirror useless unless I rinsed it with water every 10 seconds or so.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome shower mirror.  I was not expecting the mirror to be as large as it is.  It was a happy surprise.  Even better, no fog!</li>
    <li> It started fogging over on the second use. You can wipe it off but within seconds it&#x27;s fogged back over. Only solution that I recently found was to wipe some soap on it and it will keep most fog off for about 30-45 seconds.</li>
    <li> Excellent!  No fog. You can&#x27;t go wrong with a product that does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to!  Stop looking and buy it now!</li>
    <li> Junk...Fogs up in shower....</li>
    <li> The mirror is great. he problem is that is only stayed attached to the tile 3 months. Would be better if made with suction cups. Now i have a useless mirror because there is no way to attach it to the shower wall. Not sure why this got so many 5 stars. Junk after 3 months...too late for a refund.</li>
    <li> This is a great shower mirror! Easy bracket mounting, and it is actually fog-less! It&#x27;s surprising how clear ones reflection is when using it.</li>
    <li> This works good. Easy to use and to keep clean. It&#x27;s very light in weight, so if it does falls, it can&#x27;t hurt you. Inexpensive to buy also.</li>
    <li> It does, indeed, resist fogging to my satisfaction. It&#x27;s quite shiny and mirrory; I have no problems using it to shave in the shower effectively.</li>
    <li> Surface was scratched and mirror has to wiped repeatedly while shaving.</li>
    <li> This is the worst mirror! I bought this for my husband for his birthday. He really loved it and it was easy to hang in the shower. They tell you to hold the mirror under the warm shower water for a minute then to hang it back up. And it will not fog. Not the case at all. It should be called the foggy mirror. It&#x27;s useless. I plan on sending it back.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and he really seems to like it! It&#x27;s held up very well so far! We stuck it to porcelain tile and it has stayed stuck in place without any problems.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving in the shower for over 40 years (the only way to go IMO), thus having owned dozens of shaving mirrors.  None had the features that this one does. It is perfect, leaving nothing wanting.  Here is why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;excellent size for seeing your face&lt;br /&gt;excellent brilliance to the mirror itself&lt;br /&gt;hanging hole is perfect for using a Command Hook or the hook furnished, allowing easy placement and removal&lt;br /&gt;un-fogs quicker, better than any mirror in have tried in 40 years!&lt;br /&gt;so light and thin that you can travel with it -- just bring a tiny suction cup&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None, other than I wish it had been invented 40 years ago!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hints:&lt;br /&gt;1.  do not listen to anyone who complains about fogging.  Simply take the mirror and run it under the shower water for a few second, especially on the back side, and it will quickly normalize the temperature and prevent fogging.  If your shower wall is cold and it fogs again, it takes 5 seconds to spray the mirror again and re-hang it.  No bit deal, I promise, since the hanging hole at the top of the mirror makes removal a 1-second thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I was pleasantly surprised by the strength of the hanger furnished and the razor hanger too.  These are both big-time, excellent-sticking items.  Please, just use rubbing alcohol to wipe the area  to which you will be sticking them -- this is universally true for all sticky items, but nobody seems to follow directions.  Just do it, and it you will be able to hang an engine block off of these hooks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. I used a Command Strip to hang my mirror, just because I wanted the white hook rather than silver that comes with this mirror -- they both work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will note that I did not mention price in the review.  Don&#x27;t care.  The product is great at any price.</li>
    <li> Excellent mirror, my wife likes it.</li>
    <li> This is a very great product! It tells you where to place to get the best fog free shave. A+++ I love it</li>
    <li> Awesome item. My last shower mirror was poor quality and I had to constantly wipe it off to get a clear image.&lt;br /&gt;This fogless shower mirror works great and is always clear. Thanks for making a great item.</li>
    <li> Just as described. Thank you. Great shipping A++++</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what kind of water we have but this thing fogged up instantly. I so wanted this to be a great but for the hubby but sadly I can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great so far.  Just installed it yesterday.  Easy.  Just cleaned the tiles for the adhesive for the hook, let it dry, pressed the hooks on, and waited a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shower mirror works well and &amp;#34;hanging in there&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Works well, easy to install</li>
    <li> Mirror started fogging a week later</li>
    <li> This set essentially contains what you want (fogless mirror, nice hooks for razor and the mirror) and leaves out what you dont want (space-taking razor holders). I have used it a couple of times now, and can say with confidence that he mirror is absolutely fogless! I also like the elegant design that features hooks instead of suction cups. They are also very responsive to inquiries.</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price, but as soon as I received it and used it, fooged up immediately.  Its been a month now and still fogs up and would have to spray water in the mirror to reduce fog, which ain&#x27;t the end of the world.</li>
    <li> I did every thing as per several instructional emails I received and the enclosed instructions. But after just few days its fogless feature is not working. It gets foggy and I have to rinse it with water several times during my shave. I never used any kind of cleaner or cloth/towel to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea why its like that.</li>
    <li> This Mirror is a fabulous product. The installation was simple, and even someone like me, who tends to hand things crooked, was able to hang the mirror with ease. Because of the mounting hook the mirror hangs straight even though I mounted the hook wrong. The mirror itself actually does what it says it will do, I tested the product on a very cold morning and found that it really didn&#x27;t fog up even when the steam from a very HOT shower began filling the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;My husband is very pleased with this product. He can now shave in the shower, and save time getting ready for work. The mirror is light weight and has a sleek and attractive appearance. I am very pleased I was given the opportunity to review this product.</li>
    <li> Fell off the wall after day 3 and fogs up all the time.</li>
    <li> Great mirror for the value! Love using this in my shower and would recommend to anyone in search for a durable and great shower mirror. Even when the shower is nice and steamy, I still have a nice fog free reflection.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant about the fogless part, but it really does work great.  If there is any fog you can hold it under the shower water for a short moment and you are good for the rest of the time.  Adhesive that comes with it has held up fine for over two weeks so far.</li>
    <li> Fantastic mirror! Looks sleek and does the job.</li>
    <li> Mounted easily, not in the slightest fog-free however.</li>
    <li> It fogs up worst thing I&#x27;ve bought</li>
    <li> Gets foggy but wiped with warm water and clean fingers gives my husband enough time to shave his face. Aggravating it gets foggy but my husband still prefers this to shaving after showering.</li>
    <li> This mirror is not fog proof at all. It is a nice mirror and the hook that I put on the tile in my shower seems very sturdy. However, the mirror fogs up very quickly and I end up needing to wipe the mirror several times while trying to shave.</li>
    <li> Requires wiping the fog off every few minutes for me, so it depends how &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; you are looking for, but it is otherwise a solid product.</li>
    <li> Easy to use just run it under the hot water for a couple of seconds and it will stay fog free while you shave,</li>
    <li> Arrived as promised (2 days) came complete and works great. The razor holder is a great addition.</li>
    <li> started to lose its fogless function after 3 months</li>
    <li> sucks i have water stains on it after a week it is not fogless no more..</li>
    <li> Great product. Splattered water tends to stick to the mirror, but rinses away, leaving a perfect reflection.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as described.  A bit thinner/smaller than I expected - guess I&#x27;m used to the bulkier ones with frames - but it is very clear and apparently not that fragile.  I tried hanging it from a removable suction cup hook (my wife may object to the adhesive hooks it comes with, and I wanted to experiment w/ where to hang it) - the suctioncup of course let loose when I had my back turned, causing the mirror to crash to the tile floor of the shower, but with no damage at all.  Based on that, I&#x27;ve ordered a 2nd one to put in my gym bag as I find that I much prefer shaving in the shower.</li>
    <li> worked fine for about a week. now it fogs over with luke warm water running.</li>
    <li> Not too impressed. Well its a mirror not a miracle worker. It&#x27;s safe as far as not breaking in the shower but it does fog up. If you follow  the instructions you do get a window of opportunity without fog.</li>
    <li> fogs up after two weeks I have to throw water on it to shave</li>
    <li> Awesome! No fog!! Easy to clean!</li>
    <li> BEST BEST BEST fogless mirror ive ever owned. I tried and tried for years but none really were fogless. I have had this one for going on 3 years. I just bought another for vacations and the gym shower. portable, and REALLY WORKS!. Love it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a mirror. The mount has a foam tape backing instead of a suction cup.  It scratches very easily.  I use it as a camping mirror and it got scratched in my bag of clothes.</li>
    <li> I guess you get what you pay for with this product.  Mirror fogs up very easily and early on in showers.</li>
    <li> It was fogless for the first 3 days and then kept fogging up after that (within minutes of turning on the shower).  Good customer service from this company insofar as they sent me another and the same thing happened.  This is NOT a fogless mirror.</li>
    <li> Kinda cheap looking and small. Cant get the brown backing off and didn&#x27;t come with anything to attach to the shower walls.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I&#x27;ve been following the suggestion to never wipe the mirror with anything other than my wet fingers, and it still looks and works great. The provided hooks are staying in place as well. Liking it!</li>
    <li> Worked well for a week... now it fogs. Also there was a small bubble in it that distorted part of it... Wish I could find a mirror that actually doesn&#x27;t fog!!!</li>
    <li> Great mirror, works as advertised. I am in and out of shower much quicker now.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it, fog-free is what we are all looking for.  This product, thus far, is working like a dream.</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t fogged up yet. works as advertised. And the razor hook was a bonus!</li>
    <li> This thing started fogging up with my first shower have to keep throwing water on it to defog it for no more then 10 seconds at a time As bad as all the rest of the fogless scams</li>
    <li> Works great. No fog. The package arrived quickly. It was easy to install, just use rubbing alcohol to clean a spot, the adhesion sticks well....The mirror size is really nice, decent for hanging overall I am satisfied with this product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> Very happy with product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks now, so far so good.  I hope it lasts...</li>
    <li> Not very impressed. Yes it stays fogless for a little bit, but water doesn&#x27;t bead off of it to keep it clear. Water seems to stick to it to make it blurry. It&#x27;s a bit hard to explain, but ultimately I think you can get a cheaper mirror at Target and have it be just as \\&quot;fogless.\\&quot;    It comes with a hook to hang and a hook for your razor, but both are permanent. I had to go out and buy one of those suction cup hooks instead.     Note: some other reviewers said there&#x27;s a thin layer of hard-to-see plastic you have to remove before using-- the company must have changed how you remove this because they made it more easy to see and put a note that blatantly says you have to remove the layer of plastic. At first when reading the positive reviews they mentioned that some people missed the step of removing this- now it&#x27;s virtually possible to miss that step. The mirror it isn&#x27;t THAT \\&quot;magical.\\&quot;    Also, the company will harass you via email to write a 5-star review, so if you do purchase be prepared for a few hounding emails.</li>
    <li> It fogs up every few minuets but at least it&#x27;s quickly remove able. Run it under the water for a few seconds and continue shaving</li>
    <li> Great mirror. Doesn&#x27;t fog or fall off of the wall.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my husband and he loved it. He uses it everyday so that tells me he finds it very useful :D so I would recommend it to every guy :)</li>
    <li> Basic, portable, compact. Use as a travel mirror.</li>
    <li> It was very simple to setup and use, and it also came with an extra feature my husband really loved. It holds my husband’s razor perfectly for when he shaves in the shower. This is one of those items no one thinks they need but once you have it, it changes everything and you will always want one of these in every shower. Overall I highly recommend this for everyone, especially for men who shave in the shower.</li>
    <li> This mirror is indeed fogless--unless you decide to turn on the water and take a shower. Then you&#x27;ll be forced to try to cup your hands and throw warm water over it every 30 seconds to clear it up. This is a blatant rip off. Even the directions make a reference to running warm water over it if fog builds up. That should have been the signal for me to return it immediately. The guy on the cover of the box is probably smiling because he hasn&#x27;t turned the water on yet. Or maybe he&#x27;s just thinking about all of the money he&#x27;s going to rake in duping people that this cheap mirror is fogless.</li>
    <li> Had it for about a month and has never fogged up. I clean it with just soap and water.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product.  It is simple, very effective, and easy to use.  In fact, there is one additional advantage:  I travel a lot in my business and this mirror can be used easily in hotels.  I just had to get a small suction cup hook from Walmart to take with me.  Then I can hang it in the shower.  And it really is fog free.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product it a total scam. I&#x27;m surprised it&#x27;s still for sale on Amazon.  I followed all the instructions and it fogged up THE FIRST TIME I USED IT. Should have just sent $15 to a Nigerian prince.</li>
    <li> Pathetic . After using it one time it was never fogless again. This is completely usless.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this shower mirror for a long time.  At least one that wasn&#x27;t held up by suction cups.  And I can actually see myself now when I shave.  Get this mirror and you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I really liked the fog less mirror.  The pretty oval shape and the nice hook to go with it.  I accidentally ordered 2 instead of 1.  Since I like it so much I kept the 2nd one and put it in the guest bathroom.</li>
    <li> Opened the box and the only word that came to mind was disappointed.  I don&#x27;t like the way it mounts, I don&#x27;t like the razor holder.  I bought this based on other reviews, this time Amazon buyers let me down.</li>
    <li> Great shaving mirror for the shower. I&#x27;ve only used it a week or so, but pleased so far.  Easy to mount and produces a nice clear image--No fogging, just like they advertise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this item to those who &amp;#34;shower shave&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> So far so good with this one. We do wipe it off after we shower because we have very hard water. But it stays crystal clear while we are showering!</li>
    <li> My mirror hasn&#x27;t required per instructions to run under shower water, I guess my shower stall is larger than average (48x42x114H) and my mirror is 16&amp;#34; from the shower stream.  Mirror has not fogged once.</li>
    <li> The mirror works as promised - no fog.  Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Love having this mirror in my shower and it actually works!  Never fogs up and is very clear.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Anti fog does not last. Ive had 2 now and both started to fog up within 6 months.</li>
    <li> Super useful and can cut a nice chunk of time from you morning routine. This one was everything I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Best shaving mirror ever.</li>
    <li> Was fogless for about a day now I constantly have to wipe the fog off when shaving. I only bought it a week or so ago.</li>
    <li> Do not buy. Did not make it a week before it started  fogging up.</li>
    <li> This thing worked for one shower. It fogs up in under a minute of turning on the shower now. Luckily if you hold it under the showers hot water for a few seconds it will clear up then you have a short window in which you can shave before you have to hold it under the hot water again. While I never thought that I would take up the sport of speed shaving I have and let me tell you I love it. I wish I could time myself so that I could brag to all my hideously scared friends who also purchased the Speed Shaving System but the Cassani Stop Watch with Fogless Face that I purchased fogs up too quickly.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t stay fog-less for us</li>
    <li> I think the other reviewers have said it all. It&#x27;s a mirror that hangs in your shower, and it won&#x27;t fog up for the first couple weeks (pretty cool). But after that it just takes a splash of warm water on the mirror and it stays pretty clear.</li>
    <li> This product was Easy to mount and works perfectly. I have no problem shaving in the shower now! No fog in my reflection, just my beautiful self!</li>
    <li> I love the extra hook for the razor. Totally fog free! It hangs on a hook so you can actually take it down and get a better angle etc. We&#x27;re so happy with this product!! We&#x27;ve tried others in the past and this one is BY FAR the best!</li>
    <li> Have tried many over the years; often the mirrors are much more complicated and fussy than they need to be, but they have lots of parts that get yucky and scummy from the water.  This mirror is simple, very reflective, and stays clean and is easy to view.  It is such a simple product that you wonder why someone didn&#x27;t think of this sooner--hurry for great products, delivered quickly at a great price thaty work!  Do not hesitate to order, and throw out everything else you&#x27;ve tried, all of which have surely cost more!</li>
    <li> This mirror is fog less only for the first two months. Afterwards you do not see anything in it. Too expensive for just 2 months of use.</li>
    <li> Look at the picture in my review!!!!  The mirror fogs up and fast.  Took it all of 1 minute.  I&#x27;ve been suckered by this purchase.  I tried it for a week...not once did it work.  They may sell swamp land in Florida too...don&#x27;t by this mirror expecting fog free&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update when/if they send a replacement</li>
    <li> Definitely not fogless.</li>
    <li> Mirror only remains fogless for 7 days or so. After that it begins fogging up in every shower.</li>
    <li> irstly, Cassani&#x27;s Fogless Shower Mirror does the job and its dummy proof to install (so said my wife after I installed it). The mirror is wider than other simple shower mirrors on Amazon and I like the additional width for better viewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a big fan of the razor wall-mount they included. The main reasons I hadn&#x27;t purchased shower mirrors in the past is because they were either too large and bulky, too small, or there was no razor hook (plus I might be a little stubborn to stop sink shaving).  When my wife saw this mirror we (see: she) bought it right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate that the mirror is plastic so I don&#x27;t stress about it falling, and at under $20 with a guarantee it was a no-brainer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only minor issue I had: the packaging was a little crushed upon arrival and the contents spilled out of the box a bit, but the product was still in great condition.  After contacting customer support I was contacted by Amazon who took responsibility for this, as did Cassani.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for an affordable solution to your shower shave, this mirror will do the job.</li>
    <li> Hello All. when I first got this item, I was real excited. What a novel idea, shave in the shower!&lt;br /&gt;It worked great, as advertised for about a month or two. Then, it just gets worse and worse. I cleaned it as per their instructions and nothing helped. Now, I have to spray it or wipe it with my hand to shave in a foggy mirror. Maybe I got a bad one, who knows. If yours is like mine, the glory fades fast, my friend.</li>
    <li> This is the best mirror that I have ever owned and it works as they say it does. Ihave always shaved in the shower and I live in Dubai where the summer heat and humidity make mirrors ineffective. The supplied hook and razor holder is a great touch!</li>
    <li> shaving in shower...sweet!</li>
    <li> Hubby was asking for this. I haven&#x27;t heard any complaints.</li>
    <li> This is my second one of these I&#x27;ve bought.  My wife washed the first one with a cleaning agent and ruined it.  Don&#x27;t do that!  Works pretty well.</li>
    <li> Light weight and looks like a real glass mirror and works so far.</li>
    <li> Good product. Nice people. Great service.</li>
    <li> Not sure how to rate.  Bought as a Christmas present.</li>
    <li> Works great! I have noticed a bit of fog during a long shower or if I stand close to it for a long period of time while shaving, but I simply rinsed it under the water and the issue went away. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great mirror, works as described.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best shower mirror I have ever purchased. It actually works! Some claim to be fogless but, run the hot water a little too long and you can&#x27;t see a thing in them. This one stays fog free each and every time. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Working great! Its not the highest quality, but does the job.</li>
    <li> husband is sooo happy</li>
    <li> Second review. Bought this mirror several months ago. It worked as advertised then it didn&#x27;t&#x27; after a couple months. It was discouraging. The hanger then started falling off. After a while I took caulking rubbed in on the back and stuck it to the tile. It worked again. Not like it was new but close.</li>
    <li> Not fogless, bought for husband, he has to continually splash water on the mirror in order to see.</li>
    <li> This is a great product with great customer support.  They contacted via email two or three times after purchase.  I had some questions and they were extremely fast and helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read some of the negative comments and they basically stem around the mirror steaming up and getting scratched up,  I am fairly certain those are the result of not paying attention to the instructions they provide.  There is a clear plastic on the reflective part that has to come off and brown contact paper on the back that has to come off (this is a bit harder but can be done easily).  You clean this type of product with a soft cloth and soap.  If you use anything else you will scratch the surface.  So don&#x27;t do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product and the service as well.</li>
    <li> Really works. What else is there to say?</li>
    <li> Nice size mirror for shower and design is great. However, fogs every single time I am in the shower. Try to rinse under water and fogs instantly when I hang back on wall.</li>
    <li> Decent mirror.  I like the fact that it is plastic so it wont shatter in my floor if it falls.  On claim that it makes is fogless which is definitely not true.  The mirror fogs up at least 3 times during one shave.</li>
    <li> Great price and quality product</li>
    <li> Looks great and works like a charm. Love it! I have bronze shower fixtures but the hook is so small it take nothing away from the whole presentation. I just placed the shaver holder inside of my inset nooks and it tucks the shaver away nicely. Great product!</li>
    <li> 1.  Air bubbles or wrinkles started to form right away.  I rubbed them out and applied warm water  2.  Fogged up the mirror every time I showered  3.  Adhesive from the mirror fell off on the third day  ***4.  Customer service has contacted me and sent me a replacement.  Fantastic Customer Rep/service  Overall--Based on all the other great reviews, think I might have received a lemon.  My rating however still stand until they can fix my experience</li>
    <li> It just works as advertized.  I have used it for almost 6 months.  It’s still as good as the day I got it.&lt;br /&gt;No cons; but I do follow the instructions carefully.</li>
    <li> So far, so good!  Great little mirror.</li>
    <li> Works great - great company to interact with!  Has yet to fog up, and care is a breeze.</li>
    <li> Worked just as advertised.</li>
    <li> Mirror is very light weight. I wasnt sure if there was anything in the box.  Install is pretty straight forward.&lt;br /&gt;During the first shower with it, it instantly fogged up. It took a decent rinse with water for it to &amp;quot;warm up&amp;quot;. After that it seemed ok.&lt;br /&gt;The hook for the razor is separate, I thought it was attatched to the mirror. I use a mail order razor program, and the handle seems a hair too wide for the hook, but still works ok.&lt;br /&gt;**Update&lt;br /&gt;No matter if it gets a rinse to warm up, the water beads off and then it begins to fog. Curtain open or closed it doesn&#x27;t matter. Also, Cassani continues to send emails asking for 5 * reviews and to email them with concerns.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand -- this is not a fog free mirror at all. It instantly fogged up in the shower… I complained to the company and they sent me a replacement which also instantly fogged up when placed in the shower.  Useless.</li>
    <li> Fogged up my mirror in less than a month. I am real disappointed and will try a different brand.</li>
    <li> arrived soon and did add some convenience</li>
    <li> My husband loved the Fogless Shower Mirror just as much as I did. He thinks it&#x27;s a great idea because it saves him time and he can shave whiles he&#x27;s in the shower. The razor holder is a plus. The size is just perfect for shaving in the shower or applying makeup in the bathroom.  Ayay, no more mess to clean up on the sink! - See more at: [...]</li>
    <li> This mirror works perfectly. After a long, hot shower, the mirror was perfectly clear. The hooks are easy to install (do make sure the surface is clean and dry). You could also use a command hook or a nail. It has a nice hole in the top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products I like and use personally.</li>
    <li> This mirror is awesome. I have gone through so many shower mirrors. when I opened this one I thought it was a flimsy scam. But, it is so easy to use and stays crystal clear. Very pleased with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Have been using for about 2 weeks.  Occasionally fogs but simple splash of water returns mirror to normal. No complaints.</li>
    <li> this fogless mirror works as advertised, does not fog, comes with handy razor hanger, water beads off so you can see</li>
    <li> It really does not fog up. I usually shave without a mirror in the shower while the hot water and vapor soften my beard.&lt;br /&gt;Since I pretty much know my face, I don&#x27;t really need the mirror, but it&#x27;s good once in awhile</li>
    <li> The mirror works as expected, it is fog free. However, when I purchased the item I did not realize that the mounting clips use permanent adhesive. I rent and do not want to worry about the adhesive leaving a mark / ruining the shower when I leave so I have been holding the mirror with my hand.</li>
    <li> Works well. Changed my morning routine.  It really is fog-free (for a month now!).  I would recommend this to anyone who would rather shave in the shower than in front of the sink!</li>
    <li> This thing works great.  I&#x27;ve used for about 2 weeks now.  I have a fairly large shower and this hangs on the back wall away from the door and out of the water stream.  It doesn&#x27;t fog at all and I don&#x27;t even need to warm it under water before shaving.  Such a pleasure compared to my old mirror -- I can now actually see what I am doing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for less than a week and it&#x27;s already starting to fog up more and more, so I have to just keep wiping it. It gets the job done, though. It would also be nice if the attachment mechanism was connected to the mirror (a suction cup) so I could move it around if I needed to. As it is now, it&#x27;s just a mirror by itself and an adhesive hook you have to attach to the wall.</li>
    <li> Good mirror for the price. Gradually looses anti-fog effectiveness, but running it under the water for a bit keeps it fog free again for awhile.</li>
    <li> Since being married we have always wrote messages on the mirror in the morning. It was always a little something we liked to do together. After the years pasted though our mirror started to become grungy even after I cleaned it. I purchased this at a promotional price to try and out and test in the bathroom. Sure enough it does not fog up anymore and leave a water residue! Even though I will miss the morning messages I would rather have a nice clean mirror especially when guess come to stay with us!</li>
    <li> Already started fogging.</li>
    <li> Unless you have a thousand candle power light in your shower, forget it.  Most showers have overhead lighting, and the minute you try to start shaving, you&#x27;ll find the tricky spots, (your upper lip, throat etc) in SHADOW.  Had to leave the shower and go back to the sink.  Probably OK if you can get closer to it with added light.  I have a deep counter that keeps me from getting &amp;#34;up close and personal&amp;#34;, so I gave it a shot. I&#x27;m better off with a womans lighted make up mirror with magnification on one side....sounded like a good idea and then I tried to use it...in all fairness, I just might not have a decent place for it....but think about overhead lights and shadows in the shower....plus the water beaded up so bad, forget the steam....</li>
    <li> Right after placing the order and having paid I received a mail from the company telling me that some of the mirrors could come with certain failures - like the anti fog will not work - and they offer the inmediate replacement if that happens. I answered that I will not have time to try it so asked to them to ensure they will send me the good I have paid for at once.  Now I am back in my country with a mirror that fully fogs, does not work, and do not have the chance to return it. I would have expected this advice at the moment of placing the order so I can make the decision of taking the rusk or not. If you are planning to buy this I recommend to ask Cassani in advance if they have fuxed the problems or if there are failed mirrors distributed.</li>
    <li> This mirror is absolutely perfect for the purpose it is intended.  It came quickly and was easy to install.  I usually run hot water over it just once right before shaving and it remains fog free during the shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not even sure what I was doing with that crappy &amp;#34;mirror&amp;#34; I was using before I got this one. It was like going from a tiny handheld TV to a giant HD jumbotron. There is just no comparison. This mirror stays fog-free for the entire shower for the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. The razor holder is handy, too.</li>
    <li> The packaging makes it look cheap, but it works great and is a bargain! Definitely the best bang for your buck.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as it should. Don&#x27;t like the stainless steel hook though. It&#x27;s a hazard in the bathroom if you slip and fall, and can&#x27;t be re-positioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit should ship with a suction cup, which would be cheaper for the manufacturer and better for the user.</li>
    <li> work great for 1 mounth.... DONT BUY!!!</li>
    <li> This is an unbreakable, lightweight and very useful mirror for keeping in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;If it starts to fog, just wipe it with a little shampoo and rinse.&lt;br /&gt;It works great!</li>
    <li> The best of all the shower mirrors that I have owned.</li>
    <li> Its fog resistant but not fog proof. You&#x27;ll have to rinse it in the shower stream once or twice during your shave. FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS OR YOU WILL DAMAGE IT.</li>
    <li> Fogged up instantly on first use.  Worthless don&#x27;t make the same mistake.  Avoid this product.</li>
    <li> Continually fogs up in the shower, especially when I&#x27;m trying to look into it while shaving....I have to remove it from the provided hook and run it under hot water which will give me about 60-90 seconds of fogless mirroring before it begins to fog up again.  I was under the assumption that it would be fogless 100% of the time.  Other than that, provided hooks are nice and provide great adhesion.  Mirror is made of some type of plastic and seems durable enough.  It has survived two drops onto my tile floor and is no worse for wear.</li>
    <li> Could have easly been five stars except for the paper backing on the reverse of the mirror.  It does not come off but it does get moldy where the mirror touches the wall.  Likely stays damp longer in this area.  Easy fix.  I just put a stick-on rubber bumper/foot to hold ot away from the wall.  Problem solved.  No more mold.  It helps the mirror stay fogless longer as well.  I like the oval shape.  Fits your face better than a square reflection.</li>
    <li> I received an email from Cassani stating there was a manufacturing defect in this mirror. They promised to send a replacement free of charge that corrected the problem. They sent a replacement but unfortunately the replacement also had issues with fogging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could give the company five stars I would; their customer service was excellent. However, this product has fallen short. If you&#x27;re in the market for a fog less shower mirror you may want to skip this item.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for my husband and he loves it.  Fog free as promised and the hook for the mirror has worked fine in our shower.</li>
    <li> After years of shaving at the sink after showering, I finally decided to get one of these fogless shaving mirrors. What a difference! I find that I&#x27;m getting less shaving bumps and less irritation. Run hot water over the mirror for a few seconds and it stays fog-free for the duration of the shower. The company has been very good about communicating as well and seem genuinely interested in my opinion of their product. If I had one suggestion, it would be to put extra wall mounts in. I&#x27;m moving to a different house soon and will have to order a new mirror to get a mount. Otherwise, great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had shower mirrors in the past, ranging from suction cups, to ones attached to the actual shower head and using hot water behind the mirror. This works better than either. This has a larger surface than most and manages to stay fogless longer. That said, there is clearly a nice &#x27;magical&#x27; coating on this. If you were to have this mirror sprayed with shower water all of the time, instead of off to the side, I can see this mirror loosing it&#x27;s fogless properties quickly. I suspect this will need to be replaced every few years, since few coatings like that last a super long time. I&#x27;m okay with that, it&#x27;s the right price and the usability is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little hesitant of the super strong stickers used to place this shower up at first, but I&#x27;ve found it to be sturdy and the humidity hasn&#x27;t gotten to it. Hopefully that stays the case.</li>
    <li> Was afraid it might be too small, but it&#x27;s perfect and works as described. LOVE IT!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but will end up fogging after a few months. Only fix I have found is to run it under the warm water after you start showering for 10-15 seconds it it will stay clear for almost the rest of the shower duration.</li>
    <li> One of the best faster deliveres! Have this in not time at my home door! Thanks also like to mention that it full my expectations that I was looking for this product. Thanks</li>
    <li> This works good but it&#x27;s not a true mirror.  However, you can still see well and it works.</li>
    <li> The size is good, but it&#x27;s not fogless!</li>
    <li> Like how it&#x27;s flush to wall, good quality</li>
    <li> Easy to install, fogless mirror that my Hubby loves. Better yet the pre-delivery instructions and the follow up from the company explaining installation, cleaning and urges you to contact them with any problem.</li>
    <li> Mirror fogs within 30-seconds of turning on the shower.  Not as advertised.</li>
    <li> I did follow the instructions,  it did work only for 5 days, very bad quality</li>
    <li> Great product for the price.  I just rinse it off in the shower prior to lathering up and it works just fine.  The holder for the shaver also works as described.  No more suction cups or silicone adhesive!  Happy, Happy, Happy!</li>
    <li> Could&#x27;ve just bought a dollar store mirror instead of wasting money on this. The supposedly fogless mirror only worked the first use. Now it fogs right away and is pointless ...I even followed the instructions to not clean it or rub it, the only thing that touched it was water!</li>
    <li> The Fogless Shower Mirror works like a charm, was easy to install, doesn&#x27;t fog up and looks great too! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This mirror looks really chic and is easy to put up. The anti-fog technology seems to work really well. I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Good product, and although clearly much more expensive for the little piece of plastic that it is, I am happy to have paid the price because a) it does what it promises to, and b) the service is amazing. After two days of use, the hook came off and the mirror fell and got chipped on the sides. I was worried about putting it up again because the adhesive on the hook was no longer pristine in terms of stickiness. I contacted customer service and they not only sent another hook, they even sent another mirror since the first one was chipped and somewhat unsightly. Put up the new hook and mirror three months ago and no problem since then. No fogging at all even though my bathroom is very tiny and fogs up heavily during a shower. I also like the size of the mirror, not too small or too big and does not look tacky.</li>
    <li> It steams up pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Better than other shower mirrors I&#x27;ve used in the past&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice that you can take it out of the shower without having to remove/replace the mounting piece.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> Worthless. The first two showers had some fog but usable. Offer the next half dozen showers the mirror become so opaque I couldn&#x27;t see anything. I only ever cleaned it with water and my hand but it did nothing but wipe the droplets off momentarily. After a month I decided might as well try some cleaner since it&#x27;s already going in the trash anyway. Used some 409 and my Palm but it barely did anything to clean it. I fact I now use a regular mirror that&#x27;s not even meant for the show and it is way clearer. And it comes totally clean with normal water. Very disappointed with this piece of crap.</li>
    <li> After about a week, it fogs up instantly. Never used any sort of chemicals or cleansers on it. Water from the shower is the only thing that ever gets on it. Probably the worst product I&#x27;ve ever purchased through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Sticks well, not at all fogless</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t how some of the people made the bad comments about attaching it to wall because it went on very easily and has not shown any sign of failing. I did allow the hook to hang over night with a load. the mirror has stayed pretty clear and if it collects some drops of water, just splash some water on it enough to sheet over the mirror and it is clear again. No condensation at all. For the price this is a true winner. Also if you ever do need to clean it you can easily take it off the hook and take anywhere you want to work on it.</li>
    <li> This item is not a glass mirror. Instead it&#x27;s a oval of stainless metal. However I&#x27;ve found it excellent to use. There&#x27;s nearly no distortion, no waterspouts and cleans up with a 1/2 second swish of the shower spray.&lt;br /&gt;I have it hanging on my shower wall. I try to hold it by the edges only without leaving any fingerprints. Hangs alongside the razor holder (included) which fits my Gillette Mach3 razor pretty well. The water here isn&#x27;t softened but it&#x27;s not a particularly hard water to start with, the water tastes bad due to high chlorine issues.&lt;br /&gt;I had a real mirror in the shower for 15 years. Couldn&#x27;t see my reflection but for a 2x2 patch. Kept moving the mirror to defog it.  This mirror if it starts to fog up just quickly run it through the shower to change the temperature of the metal to prevent fogging, really easy.  I&#x27;ve used it for about 2-3 months and it&#x27;s all smiles for me. Just like new.</li>
    <li> I love the mirror it works well.  My only issue is the holder they provided to hold the razor fell off within 12 hours.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my hubby after buying a few shower mirrors that promised not to fog.  We were surprised to find that this mirror really does not  fog! Needless to say, hubby is happy and it was one of his fav Christmas gifts!</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for! It is nice to shave in the shower and this mirror makes it possible. I have used it for a couple weeks now and it works great! The razor holder is the perfect size for my razor and the size of the mirror is perfect for shaving without taking up too much space in the shower.</li>
    <li> The product is simple in design. The mirror itself is as pictured, an oval piece of reflective material. The hanging brackets are stamped aluminum with sticky pads, that actually hold very well.  The problem with the product is that it lasted less than two weeks of daily use. At first it was great, water would run right off it, much as if you sprayed it with an aqua-phobic product like Rain-O or some such. I just chalked it up to my own fault at buying a cheap product off the internet, with higher expectations that I should have had.  But then the company began emailing me, requesting a five star review. That they are a small company and if I had any issues they&#x27;d be happy to send me a replacement product. This WOULD be great customer service IF I wanted another product that was going to only last two weeks. The fact that Cassani Company is reaching out to customers begging for a five star review and pandering by offering free products actually undermine the whole effort. The fact that they are offering a replacement to a product that didn&#x27;t even last until they sent me an email OFFERING a replacement is just pathetic.  If I could have rated the product less than one star, I would have.</li>
    <li> Worked for a few weeks. Now it fogs pretty much every time I am in the shower. Kinda annoying to have to wipe it down like 5-7 times every time I shave.</li>
    <li> Terrible! Started to fog up within minutes. Mirror is crystalizing around the edges and spreading across the entirety of the mirror during first use.</li>
    <li> The description of this product is fake. Its is NOT fog-less. It is just like other regular mirror that you put in your shower over priced. As soon as you start taking a shower with warm water it became foggy. The seller used the fancy marketing work of fog-less but it that does not work. I am disappointed with this product because of all the reviews on this product and its description tell you the great it is but is not real and is misleading. I attached a picture that can talk more than 1000 words.</li>
    <li> The company is great to work with. My mirror fogged up in a week and they replaced it. It works for a short time and then I have to wipe it off with my hand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with my mirror.  It gives a very clear reflection and makes for easy shaving.  It is not one of those cheap mirrors that distorts your face when you are looking into it.  While it does occasionally fog up, it is typically after a long time in the shower, and once it does, I just slip it off its hook on the wall, run it under the shower water, and then it is clear and fine for the rest of my shave.  It is very lightweight and easily slips on and off, so I have not found this to be an inconvenience at all.  Much better than previous bulky, battery-operated ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.  For shower shavers, I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great product so far.  Must have for anyone that shaves in the shower.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wanted one of these for years, and it works flawlessly. Easy to install and use. It hasn&#x27;t even fogged up once yet. Great buy.</li>
    <li> For the first couple months it was great. Fogs up now for some reason? Never put a cleaner on it or anything?</li>
    <li> Worked for 2 days.. Waste of money</li>
    <li> Works like any other type of shower mirror. Consistently fogs up...</li>
    <li> I will keep this short and sweet.... This product is awesome and I should have bought it a long time ago.  Fellas, do yourself a favor, if you don&#x27;t have a mirror for the shower, this is the one to get.  It is made of a plastic material, but if you do what the box says and warm it up under the running warm water, it works great! No complaints here, also made in the USA!!!!</li>
    <li> Took 2 to get one that works as advertised but the 2nd is GREAT! Not sure what the issue with the 1st was right out of the box, but the seller replaced it ASAP and the replacement is fine.</li>
    <li> Followed directions. Still fogs up in a matter of minutes. Not user error. Going to order the style I had previously - where you fill the back up with hot water to prevent the mirror from fogging.</li>
    <li> I have always hated having to wait for the bathroom mirror to de-fog after taking a shower, now I don&#x27;t have to!  I simply love this mirror.  It works great both in the shower and on the bathroom counter right after a shower.</li>
    <li> Simple steel hook and razor holder are modern and adhere perfectly. Best fog less mirror I&#x27;ve owned and I&#x27;ve owned a few  Good size too.</li>
    <li> I Got this to try out and we loved it Shaving in the shower for my hubby has also helped a lot with his razor burn.  He used to do it over the sink with a electric razor not only did it make a huge mess but he would get the worse razor burn.  Now that he can shave in the shower the steam helps keep his face nice and moist and not nearly as much razor burn as before.</li>
    <li> If you still don&#x27;t show in the shower, you should definitely try it, especially if you have sensitive skin and ingrown hair issues. This mirror does the job really well and for this price it&#x27;s one of the best options out there</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several mirrors, this is the best by far, stays clear, easy to hang and has a large surface area making it easy to shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about 2 weeks now and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  It&#x27;s lightweight but it&#x27;s crystal clear - just like looking in a regular mirror.  It was easy to mount.  The razor hook is a nice bonus.  Mirror hasn&#x27;t fogged up at all.  It&#x27;s a great size - I can easily see my whole face when shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve shaved every day since I&#x27;ve had this so my wife has been happy (I used to shave every 4-5 days).  My only regret is I didn&#x27;t buy it sooner.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this!</li>
    <li> I have used many different mirrors in the shower for shaving. This is by far the best. Easy to put up, fog free and makes shaving so easy. I will buy a second one soon</li>
    <li> The mirror fogs everytime.</li>
    <li> It is not fog free.  Can&#x27;t figure out why.  I need to constantly wipe off to see myself.  Maybe i am doing something wrong.  Whatever, very frustrating.</li>
    <li> Mirror has fogged from the first usage. Tried all of the &amp;#34;tricks&amp;#34; to no avail. Keep your money and look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Not fogless. Fogged up the second time I used it. The mounts hold well. Install was easy. Product is relatively inexpensive. I like it other than the fact that I bought a &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirror and it&#x27;s far from that.</li>
    <li> Not real fancy, but it does actually work.</li>
    <li> Great mirror. It does not fog up and works really well for shaving.  Their customer service is really great as well. The respond and act very quickly.</li>
    <li> Started fogging up within 2 days. Just splash water on it and it&#x27;s fine. I&#x27;m just going to assume this is how they all work...</li>
    <li> &amp;#60;a href&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;TOPdb5728fd838d2032da26cfb3cb450b17&amp;#34; rel&#x3D;&amp;#34;nofollow&amp;#34;&amp;#62;&amp;#60;img style&#x3D;&amp;#34;display: none&amp;#34; src&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/images/front/pixel.png&amp;#34; &amp;#62;&lt;/a&gt; I got this discounted for an honest opinion, and I really love it. It comes with a hook to mount it right in the shower and even a hook to hang your razor on i use it to wash my face and shave my under arms :p and the hubby uses it to shave his face! Saves time and saves us from the mess of whiskers all over the sink too. It really is fogless. Awesome product and amazing customer service! &amp;#60;a href&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;BOTTOMdb5728fd838d2032da26cfb3cb450b17&amp;#34; rel&#x3D;&amp;#34;nofollow&amp;#34;&amp;#62;&amp;#60;img style&#x3D;&amp;#34;display: none&amp;#34; src&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/images/front/pixel.png&amp;#34; &amp;#62;&lt;/a&gt;</li>
    <li> Great mirror for the shower. Perfect size, works great. Packaged well and looks very clear. Nice handers included, simple to use.</li>
    <li> Even though it says fogless, it still gets fogged up initially, but once you run it in the water as directed it lasts through out my shave. I like the contemporary styling.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I received an original. After it didn&#x27;t really work, Cassani was gracious enough to send me a replacement. Unfortunately, it still didn&#x27;t work well. Maybe it&#x27;s just too hot and humid in Nashville in the summer, but it fogs up just like any other mirror for me. I&#x27;ve taken it out of direct path of cooler air, not used cleaning products, handled with care - doesn&#x27;t matter. It fogs up just as bad as a regular mirror, though it takes a few seconds longer on this one (which I guess is a plus).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor clip is nice though, so that&#x27;s why it gets 2 stars. Otherwise, it just simply doesn&#x27;t work in Nashville. If you live in Vegas or Arizona, it may be great. Not in the South!</li>
    <li> Not entirely fogless, but it does stay fogless enough between rinses to get some of my shaving done.  I have to rinse it off a couple of times each shower shave session.  Annoying but not as annoying as having to shave in the sink.</li>
    <li> Works great, easy to install. Be suer to remove the almost invisble plastic film that covers (and protects) the mirror surface. I can now shave in the shower, which makes shaving easier and smoother.</li>
    <li> Just received it - so far so good.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and a very proactive and motivated staff. Great product, works as advertised. Simple directions to install and maintain. Five stars!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if any mirror is truly fogless... but this one is ok.  However, I got some body wash on it the other day, and it seemed to mess up the finish.  Now it always fogs when I start showering, but can be cleared if I splash water on it.  Very affordable though, and it looks nice.</li>
    <li> Maybe slightly fog resistant, but still fogged up completely in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> I have a number of shower mirrors that you filled with hot water to keep to fog off. I purchased this and for the first few days was very thrilled with the performance. Then, it started to fog like any mirror and there was little I could do to see in it to shave. Very disappointed! The seller also bombards you with emails asking you to contact them before rating gives no way to do so. Returned for refund. SAD!</li>
    <li> I am giving this a 3 star because the hook only lasted about a week before it fell of the wall, and the mirror does actually fog up. To me the only saving grace is the hole on the mirror makes it easy to remove and rinse off when it does fog up. I had to purchase a plastic 3M command hook for wet application to hang this mirror. Never had a mirror in the shower so having this is super nice to shave with.</li>
    <li> Works like advertised. Easy to install, easy to use, easy to clean. Awesome!!</li>
    <li> Mirror works better than old one but started fogging up after few weeks</li>
    <li> Awesome product, great company and customer service.  Finally a product and company that works like it is supposed to, and a company that stands behind its product.</li>
    <li> I have used the mirror for several weeks and it really is fog free. Lightweight and easy to put up. One word of caution when you attach the holding clips to the tile MAKE sure that you have them in the correct position as they are IMPOSSIBLE to move. Good value for money. This probably the fourth mirror I have owned and this is by far the best. Thank goodness it doesn&#x27;t have those stupid suction cups.</li>
    <li> The first one I got I returned, because it came with a note saying some of these were defective, and, well mine was about as fogless as Frankenstein&#x27;s Castle.&lt;br /&gt;After answering all kinds of questions that helped them ascertain that I was using it correctly. They sent me another one.&lt;br /&gt;Now this is the weird part. The replacement was also not fogless, but because I had been through the return process once I really wanted it to work, it hangs on a hook so it is annoying at first but after a while I have gotten used to rinsing off, because there are a few seconds when it is wet and fog has not condensed. So I just rinse it off, continually.&lt;br /&gt;Is this a fog less mirror?&lt;br /&gt;Well that depends on if you have just washed off the fog.&lt;br /&gt;If the word &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; has a legal definition that is not what I understood it to mean, because I thought that this mirror would be fog free, or unfoggable, or fog proof, but I am disappointed to say that it does nothing to resist fogging.</li>
    <li> My husband takes VERY hot showers but he said it never once fogged up!  He also said that it was very easy to see any spots he may have missed, which is a definite plus because before he would always find several after he got finished...you know.....shaving blind and all .  When I went into the bathroom after his shower everything was covered in steam....everything except the shaving mirror that is.  It was completely fog free.  I was shocked since the bathroom mirror was dripping with steam.  So if you are looking for a good mirror that you can use in the shower this is the one for you.</li>
    <li> the fogless mirror works perfectly for Shaving In The Shower. Sorry About The Caps. my Phone Would BeGetting A One Star rating.</li>
    <li> Fogs up during shower!!!</li>
    <li> Mirror is simple and great! Have used it almost daily for 2 weeks now and it hasn&#x27;t fogged or fallen from the wall yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought and thrown away countless &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirrors.  This is the best one ever, stays fogless, clearest vision ever for a plastic mirror.  Simple and easy installation, simple design.</li>
    <li> big easy to use and completely fog less,  Even after 30 minutes showers, it was much better than the last mirror I had</li>
    <li> Of all the products I&#x27;ve ordered on Amazon this is the worst. I followed the instructions to the letter, including the small sticker on the back that&lt;br /&gt;instructed me to peel off the back cover. The result ,on the 2nd day and every day thereafter the mirror fogged  up in less then 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;I find this strange because I owned this mirror before and it worked great for almost 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;Barry Sullivan</li>
    <li> This mirror works great. It doesn&#x27;t fog up even in a hot shower. Easy to hang and easy to care for.</li>
    <li> As advertised. Works perfectly and looks very sleek. The stainless hook and mirror have a very low profile unlike other mirrors I&#x27;ve had. Plus the no suction cups so it stays where it&#x27;s supposed to be: on my shower wall.</li>
    <li> I got fed up with taking time to shave in front of a mirror in a cold bathroom and was looking to enjoy a hot and efficient shave in the shower. Only problem was that i couldn&#x27;t see what I was doing. I found out fogless mirrors exist, so I set out to buy one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit fits my needs perfectly. It mounts with double-sided tape, so I can remove it later when I move out of this rental apartment. The razor holder is a nice plus. The star of the show - the mirror - stays fog free in a steamy shower when rinsed as directed. Even without rinsing I can see myself pretty well for the most part. The whole kit is cheap to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only nit picky critical views of the product are that 1. I had to wrestle with the packaging for a few seconds to get everything out (but who cares, it goes to trash) and 2. I wish it came with extra adhesive pads (but I can see that the product may have been intended to be installed once, and I can buy more pads once I move).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> The mirror is fog-free as stated--just follow the simple directions. The hooks are very easy to install. (Time will tell how durable the adhesive is.) It is very nice to be able shave where cleanup is taken care of by the shower spray. I contacted Cassani by e-mail and received a quick reply from &amp;#34;Michael&amp;#34;. He is a very helpful and polite representative of the company. I think this product is an excellent Christmas gift. And it would be easy to gift-wrap or stuff into a stocking.</li>
    <li> nice design, easy to set up/install but it does fog up..... after a few minutes in the shower you do need to throw some water on it....</li>
    <li> I have had my mirror now for about 3 weeks.  It remains fogless and i am very pleased with this purchase.  Great value!&lt;br /&gt;...my only regret is that i installed it too close to the shower-head and the spray bounces off me and gets on the mirror before I shave.  Other users should consider this when installing to avoid this.  I would like it if the company would sell additional hooks and shaver holders.  I would buy them because I could move the hook further from the shower and install another holder get my wife&#x27;s shaver off the ledge.</li>
    <li> An excellent shower mirror.  Good size.  Makes it easy to see your face for shaving.  No problem attaching to tile wall.  Stays in place.  Mirror stays fog free and cleans easily.</li>
    <li> Make sure you take care where you hang it! Great mirror, works as specified, shaving in the shower is great.</li>
    <li> This Mirror is Amazing it&#x27;s better than the mirrors I have in my home!!!! When I used this Fogless Mirror It did not steam up no matter how hot it was in the shower. I love it!! This is my honest opinion. I would like to purchase some of these for my family members because their mirrors tend to fog up especially when they are in a rush for work or a date of some sort. Thank you Cassani #Tomoson</li>
    <li> It was wonderful for the first month or so... and then it started fogging up and I have to wipe it off every 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Very poor !!!  That no work with the fog I can&#x27;t see my face.</li>
    <li> This seller gets five starts -- fifty stars -- for customer service and responsiveness. Unfortunately I have to give the product one star because it does not work. After one or two showers, following all directions perfectly, it started to fog up. I received a free replacement from the company, again followed all the instructions, and had the same effect. I bought a little suction-cup hook to try out the mirror in different parts of the shower. Nope, always fogs. I can rinse it off in the shower, re-hang it, and get halfway through a shave before repeating, but that is the same as a regular mirror.</li>
    <li> Easy to hang.  Does still fog a little but we only use it in the shower when we actually need it and store it in the drawer otherwise.  That helps.  Would buy again!</li>
    <li> I have had 2 of these both bought from Amazon and after a few months the anti fog properties wear away. I love having a mirror in the shower and continue to use it but now I have to hold it and frequently rinse it with warm water to clear the surface.  If I am doing something wrong or if someone knows how to refresh the surface please share.</li>
    <li> This is the second fogless shower mirror I have owned.  I was happy with the first, but only because I didn&#x27;t know better.  When it broke after the suction cup failed and it fell to the floor, I bought this one.  The first required a rinse or two while shaving to remove fog (condensation).  Instructions on this one say to warm front and back by running hot water over it, but at least in the shower I have (fairly large) this isn&#x27;t necessary.  It stays fog-free throughout a long hot shower.  It really works well!!!</li>
    <li> We just remodeled our bathroom and shower and were  looking for an alternative to a suction cup mirror for the shower.  This is perfect due to its slim design, razor holder, and adhesive back.  It is mounted flush on the shower tile and is very discreet.  No fog issues either !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m becoming increasingly disappointed with this mirror because it is so hard to clean. I&#x27;m on my second unit because I had to keep trying something more abrasive to get the water spots off. Hand scrubbing under warm water only worked for the first month and then I switched to rags and what not, eventually resulting in scratches on the mirror. I&#x27;m starting to have the same problem with my second mirror and do not plan on buying a third. I&#x27;ll try another brand after this one is scratched up.</li>
    <li> Waste of money.  Didn&#x27;t work from day one.  My sink mirror was clearer after my shower.</li>
    <li> I could not understand why the company who sold this kept on sending me emails asking for a 5 star rating and after 2 or 3 I ignored, I wrote back explaining that the item was for a shower in an RV and I would not be using the item until about 2 months after purchase so I could not rate an itemized have not yet used.  Now I think I understand why they wanted their item rated right away.  After approximately 30 showers the mirror fogs as least as badly as the one it replaced.  I was careful to follow the instructions.  I gave the item 2 stars only cause it did function perfectly for about a month and the hooks adhere well to the smooth shower enclosure and it was rather inexpensive.  I expect to replace this with something from bed bath and beyond and really don&#x27;t care if it is 3 or more times price since I want a shower mirror that performs without fogging and that retailer (bb&amp;b) seems to have a return/replace/refund policy that has no limits.  I need to add I was very happy with this &amp;#34;fog less&amp;#34; mirror for about a month so had I reviewed it shortly after receiving it, the rating would have been 5 stars</li>
    <li> it still gets foggy after awhile</li>
    <li> I have always enjoyed shaving in the shower, mainly because of the efficiency, but also because I feel that I get a better shave with the steam and all. The downside to shaving in the shower for me has always been the difficulty in getting my sideburns straight and making sure I didn’t miss anything, so for the last year or two I have been bringing a cheapo (dollar store) hand held plastic mirror in the shower with me which has helped, but, of course it gets all fogged up and needs to be held. I have found the solution to this to simply rinse the mirror under the shower for a second, which not only cleans the surface but also heats the mirror, which eliminates the fog (which is created by significant temp differences between the surface and the shower)... Anyways, I recently came across this highly rated &#x27;fogless&#x27; mirror on amazon which claims to be fogless and hangs on the wall. I did a bit of research, read some reviews, and while I still wasn’t entirely clear on how it works, I figured for $15 I would give it a try. Awesome, problems solved. Or so I thought... It arrived yesterday and I was excited to put it to use. The adhesive sticks to just about any surface well, and I like that it comes with an additional razor hanger. The mirror itself is basically just a super basic oval plastic mirror about 2mm thick with a hole in it for hanging. Now how well did it work you might ask? Well, not very well at all... First of all it fogged up almost immediately, and stayed foggy until I took it off the hook and held it under the shower a bit (just like I had always done with the dollar store regular mirror), it then stayed fogless for a few minutes (until it started to cool) and then fogged up again (just like my $1 mirror)... Basically in the end I realized that there isn’t anything special or magic about this mirror. It simply uses the basic science of condensation where it will form when a surface is cooler than the outside environment (your shower), so by simplyheating up the mirror you are eliminating the condensation... That being said, I would probably recommend to a friend to save a few bucks by buying a cheap thin plastic mirror (glass takes longer to heat and has the risk of breaking). Then if they wanted it to hang (a nice feature that I like) they could simply buy a 3m hook (sold everywhere) to stick in their shower, which would provide the same benefits of this mirror... All in all though, at $15 the price isn’t terrible (and not worth returning), but if your expecting more than a basic mirror that hangs in your shower then save your money. On a very positive note though, the seller Cassani Company has excellent customer service and I have already received several emails from them, notifying me the item has shipped, on proper use etc. So kudos to them on that front.</li>
    <li> Is it fogless...no.  First use mirror fogged up completely.  Good part - it&#x27;s easily un-hookable from the included hook so you can rinse the fog off and keep shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice that it comes with a razor hook...but...I would have preferred that the product was Fogless...as their box and marketing material states.</li>
    <li> Bought 2 of them.  First one lasted a few months but died young as i tried cleaning solution.  Bought another and it only lasted a few weeks.  Was very careful not to put product on it and only cleaned it with my hands and water.  No luck.  I reached out to their customer service via their website and never received a response.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s simple... of all the fogless shower mirrors we&#x27;ve tried over the years, this has so far been the best.  The others we&#x27;ve purchased from local retailers are either not fogless, fall too much, or leave gross residue around the suction cups after awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grab this one, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> For the first week this worked 100% great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the instructions, no cleaners, etc. I mounted it away from the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first week it was simply unusable in the shower. Moving it closer to the hot water seemed to help though. I suspect my overly powerful shower vent is creating a cold draft and the temperature difference is overpowering whatever coating they put on this thing. Making sure to keep it&#x27;s temperature stable ensures no condensation (fog) which is simple physics although it makes me wonder just how much work the &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; feature is actually doing.</li>
    <li> Perfect item for the price - have to follow instructions - do not rub the mirror</li>
    <li> Simple design and very easy to install, and most important it works.  It is the first fog-less shower mirror that I have bought that actually works.  I have spent more money on other products and not a one of them really worked.  If you are interested in buying a fog less mirror, look no further,  this by far is the best and it is a great bargain,  just buy it already.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband as a Christmas present, and he can&#x27;t complain. It hasn&#x27;t fogged once, and the small holder for your razor is pretty convenient. I actually use the holder for my razor, and I like that the mirror is quite sleek so it doesn&#x27;t take up a huge amount of space in the shower. If you&#x27;re thinking about buying this...do!</li>
    <li> Stays fogless as promised, unlike other brands I&#x27;ve tried. And the sticky pads on this one turn out to be a lot more reliable than those ridiculous suction cups.</li>
    <li> I love how it mounts and it didn&#x27;t fog until a month passed. it should only get two stars but i have yet to find a mirror that doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> it is simple to put up ( I did not use the enclosed hook but a suction cup with a little nub on it that I had) The mirror is light, simple and does not fog up. Works great and exactly what I wanted and needed. Well done to this great little mirror.</li>
    <li> My husband is a avid shower shaver so I jumped at the chance to be able to try the Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror. His job requires that he have a clean shaven face daily. My husband has really been impressed with this mirror so far. It was very easy to set up in the shower and the mirror is very clear and fog  free. This is a great product that would make a great gift. Ships quickly and works like a charm! Even comes with a razor wall mount for your razor.</li>
    <li> I received one of the the Cassani Fogless Shower Mirrors for review purposes and was very delighted with the it! True to it&#x27;s name, it doesn&#x27;t fog up! We have tried other mirrors in the past and they didn&#x27;t live up to their claims and we ended up using them outside the shower because they just didn&#x27;t work. This one works wonderfully! I LOVE the included razor holder too! It keeps the razor handy, yet out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;The mirror features a rounded design that makes it easy to see your face. It&#x27;s modern design and stainless steel mounts match almost any decor. It is super easy to use and hang. Simply place the stainless steel wall mounts where they are most convenient in your shower, affix your shower mirror and personal razor. And you are ready to shave!&lt;br /&gt;~~ Anti-Fog Nanotechnology repels fog and allows you to focus on getting your best shave possible&lt;br /&gt;~~ Shaving in the shower softens skin and open pores for a closer shave&lt;br /&gt;~~ Helps eliminate razor burn&lt;br /&gt;~~ Eliminates the mess around the sink!!&lt;br /&gt;~~ Useful for women as well as men.&lt;br /&gt;After our showers, the large mirror over the sink is completely fogged over, but the Cassani Fogless Mirror is fog-free! I anticipate this mirror being useful to us for a long time to come!</li>
    <li> I have been using my fogless mirror for a couple of months now, and it has worked 100% in my shower. It is light weight, doesn&#x27;t fog up.  I am 100% pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Great mirror for the shower. Fog free as described and very sleek looking.</li>
    <li> My husband enjoys this new little toy very much and agrees to everything the mirror promises above! The mirror really stays fog free in our hot steamy bathroom! The installation could not be any easier as the mirror comes with a wall mount you simply stick to the wall- no screws or drill needed! Super easy and it looks nice and sleek. It even comes with a little wall mount just for the razor.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what he wanted.  Does not fog and was infinitely less expensive than those with articulating arms.  No more worrying about dropping a fragile glass mirror.</li>
    <li> Works great! Stays clear even with very hot showers.</li>
    <li> This is a great shower mirror and razor hook.  Just a quick rub of the wall with alcohol, attach the hanger for the mirrow and razor hook wait a bit and you are ready to go.  The mirror has a clear reflection and stays clear.  It is the best I have found in the last 30 years for an in shower mirror.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror and think that it is a great addition to my shower! It also helps keep my hubbies whiskers off my sink! LOL I think that this is a great product that does exactly what it says it does. No false claims that I can see here! I love the sleek design and sturdy hook, and I think the fact that it comes with a mount for your razor is great. Many companies would have that as a separate purchase but it comes with every Cassani Shower Mirror!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband so he can shave in the shower.  It does fog up quickly which appears to be different from the product description.  Maybe I got a &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; one.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my boyfriend because he avoids beard trimming due to the inconvenience and ends up looking like a vagrant. He loves it, and uses it regularly. So many levels of win with this: price, convenience, product quality and and a fresh bearded fellow on my arm.</li>
    <li> The mirror worked great for about two weeks and then up and quit working.  Now it&#x27;s fogging up as soon as the water gets hot.</li>
    <li> Fogless Shower Mirror - EASY INSTALL - SHATTER PROOF - Includes Razor Hook - Modern - Anti-Fog Nanotechnology - Exclusive To Amazon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cassani Fogless Shower mirror is oval and measures 7.5 x 5.7 x 0.1 inches, it comes with two different hooks, mirror, and instructions. Please read the instructions before you begin to unpack your mirror as it contains pertinent information on installation.&lt;br /&gt;Decide where you want your mirror, it is preferable to have it out of running water range so it does not obstruct your view by water splashing on it, although keep it nearer to the shower head. This may require you to stand in your tub to find the perfect height. Once you do clean the area well wipe dry and use rubbing alcohol to clean the surface and apply the first hook, it is the one with only one hook on it. Remove backing and apply the hook to the wall for at least 45 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not remove the covering from the mirror yet, but set it on the hook and find a place to put the second hook which will hold your razor that is why there are two hooks on it. We have found you can put your razor on it across or hang the head through it leaving the metal blades inward or outward whichever you prefer. Again follow the above instructions on how to hand the second hook same as the first. Allow both to adhere for a couple hours, then remove the covering from the mirror and hang it on the first hook, and the razor in the second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now you are ready for your shaving experience with your new Fogless Shower Mirror. Cleaning the mirror is not difficult, but do not using cleaning supplies. You can rinse it with water and use your hand to wipe of excess water, or use water and vinegar 50/50 doing the same process by wiping it off with your hand. Cleaning supplies and rubbing it with a towel or cloth will scratch your mirror. These do not last forever and will need to be replaced, but if you take care and follow the instructions you will get your moneys worth out of your product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with this purchase, it also gave use some family time installing the mirror as everyone wanted to try it out. *This review is my 100% honest opinion, I have received this product for testing purposes at a reduced rate or free.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for everyone that shaves in the shower and tired of fogged up mirrors, or hair in the sink.ut of your product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with this purchase, it also gave use some family time installing the mirror as everyone wanted to try it out. *This review is my 100% honest opinion, I have received this product for testing purposes at a reduced rate or free.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for everyone that shaves in the shower and tired of fogged up mirrors, or hair in the sink.</li>
    <li> I love using this to make sure that I apply mask and face exfoliator to my entire face in the shower. My fiance also loves using it while he shaves in the shower. He definitely prefers shaving in the shower and it has made it more of his daily routine, rather than a chore, where he has to take all of his stuff out and assemble it, etc. Now, he just quickly does it in the shower. We&#x27;ve been using this for about two months now and have had no problems at all. It hasn&#x27;t slipped off the wall or had any problems or anything like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be good for basically any shower, any bathroom. It is nice enough for more upscale showers, but doesn&#x27;t have any unnecessary gadgets, so it could work in any bathroom (even dorms). The razor wall mount is the perfect size for any razor and I love the mirror. In the rare event that the fog free shower mirror does fog up or gets something on it, I just take it off the wall mount, run it under the water, and voila, it&#x27;s perfect again!</li>
    <li> This mirror is perfect for my needs.  It stayed very well on the wall and at perfect height for me to shave while I am showering.  It is so easy to use, good quality and versatile that I bought 3 more as presents for family members.  The order got to my house in record time 1-2 days and in perfect packaging to make sure it did not break.</li>
    <li> It fogs up all the time,( defeats the purpose) the razor hook is great though</li>
    <li> This really is the best shower mirror. We tried a few different brands, and while this one is a bit more on the expensive side it&#x27;s worth the extra money. It will last a long time. Just don&#x27;t use cleaning products on it or anything abrasive!</li>
    <li> it performs just as advertised.  good size, easily mountable, and stays plenty clear for a good shave (and due to my fairly non-standard facial hair, i would say that i have a much-more-technical-than-average challenge when it comes to shaving)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one thing that isn&#x27;t stressed too much in the promotion of the product is this:  simply run the mirror under the shower spray for a few seconds, to help bring it to the ambient temperature.  that will ensure that it won&#x27;t fog up, even after letting it sit for a fair amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i haven&#x27;t felt like that was super necessary... it&#x27;s just kind of an overkill measure that ensures a worry-free shave, at the cost of literally seconds.  otherwise, just run it under the spray for one second, just to clear off streaks/splatters that happened as you were first getting in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(as a point of reference-- i mounted my mirror more or less half way on my shower wall, lengthwise.  not way down at the less-foggy end.  i wanted to be able to shave while still nicely ensconced in the shower spray, and doing so hasn&#x27;t caused any fog or spray problems)</li>
    <li> The first time was fantastic, but by the third shower/using it it starts to steam up and u have to throw water on it</li>
    <li> This is the first fogless mirror I&#x27;ve ever owned that actually worked.  The only complaint I have is that the razor hook wouldn&#x27;t stay mounted on the tile, but who cares?  The mirror actually works in a small bathroom with little ventilation.  I&#x27;m impressed and a little amazed.</li>
    <li> stays clear when running hot shower and so much easier to shave or brush teeth in bathtub under hot water.</li>
    <li> This mirror is so AMAZING. It does not fog up at all. I love how it hangs on a hook so I can take it out of the shower and use it. It&#x27;s nice to be able to do my makeup and stuff in a mirror that is not covered in fog from the shower ;) I gave it a 5 star because it really TRULY is a GREAT item!!!! I did receive this for a review, but it is 100% my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Best fogless mirror I have ever owned. I have tried every one on the market and even tried to make my own and this is the winner. Extremely happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I just installed the mirror about a week ago and I&#x27;m impressed by how well it actually works.  I&#x27;ve had &#x27;fogless&#x27; mirrors before that required constant wiping or rinsing, but this stayed incredibly clear.  It is also very thin, so it doesn&#x27;t stand out, which looks nice.  Update:  Well eventually this mirror fogs.  It seems as if you never have to wipe the mirror clean for any reason, it will remain fogless.  I found that once I cleaned the mirror it began to no longer work.  So if you can manage to never touch this mirror, it&#x27;s well worth the money. Three Stars now...</li>
    <li> I LOVED this mirror. I am always having a hard time getting my make up off all the way or seeing hard to shave areas. I actually bought two of these because i shave the back of my neckline in the shower! I loved this mirror because it really did not fog. it was SO EASY to clean and looked Great! I was super excited it came with a matching hook to hold my razor too!</li>
    <li> So far this mirror works the best out of any fog free mirror I&#x27;ve used. Really clear, unlike some. Would be quick to purchase another.</li>
    <li> I was going to give it three stars because of the poor optics. Yes, looking in it looked like loooking in the funhouse mirrors at the county fair. Then I tried to clean it, using a very soft cloth, one that I have used for my glasses. The mirrored surface is now completely useless. The plastic is so soft that the soft cloth was too much for it and now it has a permanent foggy look. A complete waste.</li>
    <li> Great product. Light weight and works well.</li>
    <li> This is the first shower mirror I&#x27;ve owned actually works.  Fog doesn&#x27;t build up on it.  It lays flat against the side of the shower on a hook so you can take it down to clean.</li>
    <li> Not much to say except that the product works.  In fact, my mirror has remained fog free out of the box without even running the mirror under warm water. Simple installation and the included razor hook is great.</li>
    <li> Easy to install and never fogs. I have ZERO complaints about this item, works perfectly and makes shaving in the shower a breeze.</li>
    <li> If you have ever shaved in the shower, then you know why fogless mirrors are so great- I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different shower mirrors, some more than $100.  The simple flat on-the-wall are the best and this is the best of those that i have found.  What makes it great is that it hangs on a stainless hook, you can lift it off to clean it, heat it up in the shower water, and i always add a touch of soap for better clarity.  The size is good.  And the stainless razor hanger was a pleasant suprise; a big improvement over the suction hanger i had which fell off the wall every few months(always late at night).  Both the mirror and razor hangers stick on very well; I expect no problems there.  I like the concept so much that i purchased a smaller version with a removable suction cup for traveling - I just returned from a 7 night cruise; it was like shaving at home...  UPDATE: 2016-08-15 Three years of use and this mirror is still my favorite; i am purchasing a replacement because of minor calcium spots.  I exepct that the new oval shape will prove to be an improvement over the previous square</li>
    <li> I know my husband will like this as he is always looking to save some time in the mornings.  All the reviews I read on the product have been great, so I&#x27;m going to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The box was smashed on one side, along with other boxes in my order, due to the poor packaging of Amazon, with multiple things being shipped together.  It is a gift so that is disappointing that the packaging now looks terrible.  I rated the packaging on the &#x27;Packaging Rating&#x27; system, informing Amazon of this with no response.</li>
    <li> It fogs up, and has fogged up since day one. I&#x27;m not sure if I got a defective unit or not, but I am surprised that this could be advertised and sold as fogless. There is literally no difference in for level between this and the bathroom mirror.</li>
    <li> This mirror is a complete flop and does not in anyway perform as promised. It fogs quickly and easily making it totally worthless for it&#x27;s stated purpose of providing a fogless way to shave in the shower. Save Your Money! Do not purchase this item.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product.  Always clean and clear!</li>
    <li> Seems to function as described. Although not the dimensions I expected, seems to be manufactured well. It&#x27;s still new, so no issues with the &amp;#34;mirror&amp;#34;, I can&#x27;t really tell if it is a foil material between clear plexi-glass-like material with the fog-free film overtop or if it is an actual piece of glass. Really lightweight, so I&#x27;m guessing its not glass of any kind and I&#x27;m concerned the steam will cause the bonding material to loosen and that will be the end of it. Kind of a flimsy item. But very simply designed so it looks really nice. And, like I said, functioning well. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d pay more than what I paid for it though ($15). If I get a year out of it I&#x27;ll be happy! (last fog-free mirror was $29 and lasted more than 5 years.</li>
    <li> Seemed very cheaply made even for the $15 I paid.  Fogless feature worked great for ~2-3 months.  Now it requires rinsing every 15seconds or so to get it clear enough for useage.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why they call it &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34;.  The first thing it does is fog up and I usually have to rinse it twice to finish my shave.  Other than that, I like it.</li>
    <li> Not a good product. Does not stick to tile. Totally useless.</li>
    <li> I have had this product for about a month now and so far it works perfectly.  The hook installation was very easy and I can definitely see this thing lasting longer than my suction cup mirror that kept falling.  The mirror has been perfectly fog-free so far without even having to warm it up with the shower water to get it to ambient temperatures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> This mirror works great. I&#x27;m very happy with it. I like the added razor hanger too.. a nice added touch. I&#x27;d buy from this company any time. The quality is good and delivery was on time. Thanks!</li>
    <li> The first time I used this product the mirror surface started to have this very strange wrinkle effect working from the outside of the mirror into the center. You could easily wipe this off but the problem is that this was some sort of protective substance put on top of the mirror. You can clearly see the line of where the wrinkle started and stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty low quality product.</li>
    <li> I think this a great item to have. It makes ease of washing my face and getting off all make up in the shower. It&#x27;s easy to clean. The company sent the product quickly. The assembly was easy and quick. And I appreciated the razor holder. What a neat accessory and invention. Update: It actually dogs up now. After having it over 2 months so I guess the anti/fog protection is only temporary. How sad. I was actually getting use to it. Now I have to wipe it more than any other Mirror.</li>
    <li> Works great so far.  Is fog free as advertised, and allows me to shave in the shower now, which I couldn&#x27;t do before.</li>
    <li> It is so easy to affix the hooks and place the mirror on. The antifog properties are so cool. My husband gets the best shave now that he can shave in the shower and not have to wait until the bathroom airs out. Since using the mirror his skin is smoother and he doesn&#x27;t get any razor burns. I highly recommend this. Would make a perfect Father&#x27;s Day present!</li>
    <li> Works better than any other  fog less mirror.  For some reason I received two of them.  Otherwise a great buy.</li>
    <li> So was fogless for the first time I showered but second time I showered it fogged up but I just spray it with my shower head when it starts fogging up then keep on shaving.</li>
    <li> Thought it was very cheaply made</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had three of these now.  The first didn&#x27;t work at all, and the company sent me another free of charge.  It worked great for a couple months and then slowly stopped working.  Since the second one worked well for a while, I decided to get a third and it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the second one did.  Overall, mediocre.  The only truly fog-free mirror I&#x27;ve had was the shower-tek version that funnels water behind the mirror.</li>
    <li> I received mine free to test and review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you shave, use face cleansers/masks, feel like tweezing your eyebrows, etc. I recommend using this. It actually works. I placed mine opposite my shower head away from the draft and water stream as required. I didn&#x27;t think in the one week I&#x27;ve had it that I would actually use it. I figured my husband would be the only one to find it useful. Honestly, the only reason I wanted to try this was to see if it would keep my husband from ruining my bathroom sink with tiny hairs after he shaves, since he already \\&quot;ruined\\&quot; his side (Too cheap to call a plumber and Drano doesn&#x27;t help :D). It;s easy to install, doesn&#x27;t fog up and easy to wipe clean. There&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you care to read the rest of my review and view additional photos, visit: [...]</li>
    <li> Quick shipping. Great product. No more shaving after shower. No fog.</li>
    <li> best Mirror Ive used. No fog, simply hangs with the adhesive metal clip on my shower caddy.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend as a joke gift to thank him for staying at his place&lt;br /&gt;one weekend as he got a little bothered when I left his guest sink a touch messy&lt;br /&gt;after I shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally I don&#x27;t leave reviews but my friend just sent me an email telling me&lt;br /&gt;how awesome I am, but now he needs another one for the guest shower since he is now using the&lt;br /&gt;Cassani fogless shower mirror in his main bathroom. haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who knew a shower mirror could bring two friends closer together?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this shower mirror because it was highly rated and the main draw was that it was fogless.    So I removed my favorite TinTin pajamas, put on some nice music, set the shower temp to a nice pleasant one while some nice music serenaded in the background. This was my moment in happiness as I happily spun up the shaving cream mixture and applied it liberally and carefree while in the bath.  Oh, whats that? I feel some splotches hit my nose and my hand and ears. Haha. No worries. In just a minute I can see where they are in all the showers high def glory and dispatch them with impunity. The hairs on my face shudder with fear as they know they can no longer hide.    So I step into full view of this shower and voila! .... foggy mirror.    That was it. At this point, I think the quest for a true fogless mirror continues. Sure, I doused some water on the mirror and hastily finished my morning shave and ablutions but the fun had evaporated like how Richard Sherman&#x27;s excitement turned to dismay mid-play as Seahawks bumbled their last play throwing an interception in Superbowl XLIX while I laughed giddily and jumped in joy for New England.    Recommendation - it&#x27;s ok. It does stave off the fog for a while but it does eventually get foggy. Splash some water on it again and you&#x27;ve bought a minute or two.</li>
    <li> Only had this mirror for a week, but love it.  Works as it should and stays fog-free.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas this year as he had really been wanting a mirror to shave in the shower. For the first week after we hung it up, it was awesome! But then it started fogging over immediately every time we turned the shower on. I exchanged it, thinking we just had a defective one- then the exact same thing happened with the replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks nice, though, so I gave it two stars. My husband doesn&#x27;t mind the fact that he has to wipe it off to use it (and keep wiping it off as he uses it), but it irks me that I spent money on something that&#x27;s supposed to be fogless and isn&#x27;t. If you&#x27;re looking for a truly fogless mirror, spend a few more bucks and get one that actually works.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this! Thank you!</li>
    <li> It was fogless for one shower and that&#x27;s it. It fogs in the first 5 minutes of a shower now. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> This mirror fogs up very quickly and repeatedly.</li>
    <li> I have had this for a two or three months and it does what it is supposed to.  I splash it with water before I shave and it stays clear.</li>
    <li> I put this in the shower so I could shave.  It fogs up to unusability in less than 30 seconds in proximity to steam.  Seriously, I spend probably 25% of my shaving time constantly wiping off the mirror with my hand so I can see in it.  Realistically you&#x27;ll have to wipe down the mirror 4-5 times during a shave cycle.  It only worked marginally better when I first got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what it&#x27;s worth the mounting kit and form factor are great.  I just really wish it would stop fogging up!</li>
    <li> The mirror catches spots a lot, but can be cleaned easily.  Easy mounting and used daily.  Not bad for the money.</li>
    <li> We had bought another mirror from a different location and it was not nearly as nice as this one!  It is great product so far!</li>
    <li> I have bought many shower mirrors in the past. This is by go far the best one. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great mirror! I just wish it was a little bit bigger. My husband uses it to shave and it works great!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, it&#x27;s a little hazey. Not a real mirror, gets the job done, cheap and effective. All shower mirrors are so so</li>
    <li> This mirror is just what my husband needed. Very lightweight and just the right size. Works great even in a hot steamy shower with a quick finger wipe. Well worth the money, should have bought an extra one for the guest bath.</li>
    <li> not only works pretty much as advertised...fogless, but Cassani Company went to the extra trouble of emailing instructions for the stick-on hooks and mirror cleaning. nice touch.</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these.  Put one in each shower in my house.  These mirrors are definitely not fogless.  Both mirrors get foggy within a minute of turning on the water in the shower.  Definitely would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Meh.  I have had much better shower mirrors than this flimsy unit.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS MIRROR! It is very light-weight, meaning you do not have to use the included hanger for which you have to pick a permanent spot. You can use a plastic suction cup with the standard hook it has(found at any $ Store or Wal-Mart), which means you can move it to any position at any time you want, a great plus! On top of that, I have dropped this several times in the shower (at least a dozen times), proving it&#x27;s stability and long life to come. The back is made of some light-weight wood composite and the front is obviously a mirror. It does a great job at not fogging up, and if it does, all you have to do is give it a swipe with a wet hand. My boyfriend suggests rubbing a bar of soap across it, and that does a great job as well. Overall, I am very pleased, as it my boyfriend. I whole heartedly recommend it as a shower mirror, for it&#x27;s anti-fogging abilities and it&#x27;s safety for the very low chance that it will ever break while in the tub!</li>
    <li> Yup, shaving in the shower is pretty nice. So great for my face, I might start shaving my legs too. OK, maybe not.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really fantastic mirror. For sure I recommend it.</li>
    <li> While I admit it is merely hearsay from my  hubster (I will have to take HIS word on it), this Fogless mirror is nifty and nice. As much as I love to look at myself in the mirror while shaving my legs, I decided he needed it more in his shower for a smooth and seamless shave. No more nicks and cuts for that guy!! He hung the mirror up, attached his razor to the hook and went on his merry way, clean shaven and well showered. A happy man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Who says a happy wife&#x3D;a happy life. More like A happy man&#x3D; yes, dear you CAN!  I definitely won some brownie points on this order. And I get to reap the benefits of a smooth shave, smooth cheeks and a kissable face. We will be paying great attention to  the cleaning cycle, and taking care of our shower mirror. We want it to have a long, happy existence in the Mr&#x27;s shower and as part of his routine. A quality product for a quality man.  Easy to use, and no fog allowed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my son and husband to use while in the shower.  It&#x27;s been a week and both say they love it.  It was very easy to hang up and it hasn&#x27;t fogged, as promised.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it has a hanger for your razor to keep next to the mirror.</li>
    <li> My favorite feature of this mirror is its simplicity. It has no plastic frame, which makes it super lightweight (hence, less likely to eventually crash and break like all my previous mirrors).</li>
    <li> Only mirror I have ever bought that works without any problems. This does what the company claims and is the best mirror I have ever bought. Excellent product at a very fair price.</li>
    <li> Mirror works as advertised; high-quality reflection, no sharp edges, and doesn&#x27;t fog up. I haven&#x27;t tested the hook yet, but it looks reasonable and will probably be mounted sometime in the future.</li>
    <li> This is such a great little mirror for the shower. I love that it is removable because my husband does not like a mirror in the shower unless it is while he is shaving, so he can easily flip it around. My toddler likes to look at herself in the tub, so I can take it down and hand it to her. And it&#x27;s nice for me to have when I&#x27;m styling my curly hair in the shower. I like my shower HOT though, so it isn&#x27;t entirely fogless. But very easy to wipe with a towel and remove the fog.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. Just as advertised. I had this product for a couple of weeks now and it never fog up; even when i shower with very hot water.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it does!  My husband was using a children&#x27;s mirror that I bought for our toddler to play with in the bathtub.  He appreciated that this one is more dignified than the one with the smiling fruit dancing around the edge.</li>
    <li> &amp;#60;a href&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;TOP58e067f51724bee745ede55192054eee&amp;#34; rel&#x3D;&amp;#34;nofollow&amp;#34;&amp;#62;&amp;#60;img style&#x3D;&amp;#34;display: none&amp;#34; src&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/images/front/pixel.png&amp;#34; &amp;#62;&amp;lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the chance to try this mirror out and at first I thought it was pretty bad, I was expecting a mirror with a suction cup mount, something ready to hang, then this mirror arrived and it uses an adhesive hook (see picture) to mount it to the wall. I actually found I preferred this method, I&#x27;ve used suction cups before and they tend to not stick well in some cases, and they stick out a bit which could make the mirror rock. With the hook method they use it&#x27;s pretty secure and doesn&#x27;t move at all. You do have to peel off some paper from the back of the mirror and a plastic sheet from the front, not a big deal. It also comes with an adhesive hook perfect for holding your razor. I use the Dollar Shave club 4 blade razor and you can see in the pic it holds it perfectly. The mirror actually worked really well. Water just falls off of it and it did not fog at all even when taking a very hot shower. After using this I would definitely recommend it. Do make sure you mount it where you want it though because you can&#x27;t adjust it once the initial hook is hung.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------------&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I received one or more of the products or services mentioned above for free in the hope that I would write a review about it.

    <li> This thing fogs repeatedly, almost right away, even if you run it under the shower. I like the design but it is practically useless.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s all.  It&#x27;s supposed to work and it does work.  And at a good price.  Who could ask for anything more?</li>
    <li> Works great! Easy to install!</li>
    <li> Really upset with this product. It was fogless for the first use, but now fogs up constantly! It&#x27;s awful.</li>
    <li> Easy to hang, lightweight and safer that glass mirrors in a shower.</li>
    <li> This definitely fogs up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty excited about using it. However, I quickly discovered that it wasn&#x27;t fogless. I got in touch with the company, they&#x27;re sending me a replacement. Hopefully the second one works better than the first one.</li>
    <li> not what I expected thin</li>
    <li> The Cassani mirror is incredibly easy to hang. You simply decide where you want the mirror to go, remove the backing from the included hanger and press firmly. The mirror sits straight and stays put for a fast and easy shave. There is even an included hanger for your razor, keeping it right there within reach when needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have used this mirror several times, not only to shave but to dye my hair as well. It can be removed from the hanger and put back in seconds, allowing you the freedom of using it for other things if desired. I hung this under the shower head so it is out of the direct spray as suggested, but still in a perfect place for shaving needs. It has held up as claimed and remained fog free every time. The instructions do tell you that for extra long showers, you may need to lightly rinse to remove any cloudiness, but this has not been an issue at all for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this can be easily removed if we no longer want it there, yet it stays put nicely for as long as we do. I am enjoying a hair free sink and he loves being able to shave and shower all at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample product to review on my blog. This has in no way influenced my opinions of this product.</li>
    <li> Love the idea and works great until the antifog coating comes off after a month or two. Now it doesn&#x27;t stay fog free. :-(</li>
    <li> We gave the Cassini Fogless Shower Mirror along with a lot of other things that Newlyweds don&#x27;t think of at our nephew&#x27;s wedding about 2 weeks ago and I waited to do my review until he could tell me how he liked it. I already knew how it worked because we have a similar one already but I wanted his opinion, not mine on the actual way it worked for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They both loved the convenience of the product and that the extra hook was there to keep track of his razor since he is about as forgetful as my husband, both can lose anything at any time. Plus it sure does save looking at all that mess in the sink!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nanotechnology that they use to keep the mirror from fogging up will also be an added bonus and you will appreciate that fact while you get an awesome shave in the shower without having to constantly wipe down the mirror to see where to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very simple procedure to hang it up (about 2 minutes) and if I can do it, anyone can. It&#x27;s very lightweight and not hard at all to hang up.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I never had a fogless mirror before and I don&#x27;t know if I could ever live without one now.&lt;br /&gt;Easily one of the greatest accessories to have in your bathroom. you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Out of the box, it will seem cheap. However, in the shower, it works better than any shower mirror I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve used the $10 or $30 shower mirrors from Bed, Bath, and Beyond. The more expensive ones last longer, but over time either the mirror fogs constantly or the suction loses its oomph. This one is nice because the adhesive is really strong, and if the mirror fogs, simply unhook it and rinse it. Beautiful design! When I saw it, I thought, &amp;#34;Why didn&#x27;t I think of that?&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror for my 7 year old.  She was learning how to take showers by herself and was only putting shampoo on the parts of her hair that she could see.  This mirror has helped her a lot.  I did not use the providing mounting hook because I&#x27;m not ready for that kind of commitment.  Instead I use one of those hooks on a suction cup and it works well.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband so he&#x27;d stop leaving hair all over the bathroom sink. It&#x27;s working great so far, it doesn&#x27;t fog up in the shower and the hair goes down the shower drain.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have purchased this product.  We moved and rather than try to rehang the mirror, I just bought a new one.  It&#x27;s inexpensive and easy to install and the previous one worked great.</li>
    <li> This mirror looks great because it is simple and modern.  You don&#x27;t have to worry about suction cups failing to work.  It sticks to the wall with adhesive glue.  It does not fog and it hasn&#x27;t fallen.  We love it!!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Works very well you just need to spray some warm water on the mirror and it stays fog free for the entire shave.</li>
    <li> The first and only thing that this mirror has done, is fog up. Fail.</li>
    <li> Well after using this for 3-4 months. Its still reflecting a image. But water does not slide off as it once did. still no fog though. The directions say not to use anything but your hand to get the water off. I found that a wash rag works really well. I also use a squeegee to get water off of it after a shower. Helps with water spots.  The permanent hanging hook means that the shaving mirror is not moveable...you have to either leave it home or buy a separate suction hook to hold it in a motel bathroom. no big deal I guess? I would more than likely buy another if this broke or something.. But please change the mounting to a suction cup, or at least provide the option of either a permanent mount or suction cup hook.</li>
    <li> The installation of the mirror in the shower was very easy and left lots of room for other bathroom toiletries and necessities! To prevent fogging up of the mirror, it was suggested that the mirror be placed at the back of the shower, but my father preferred for it to be installed at the side of the shower.  So far, the mirror is holding up well and there are no signs of wear, tear, or rust. I was worried about the latter because the mirror is exposed to moisture daily, but it hasn&#x27;t been a problem and I don&#x27;t expect it to be in the future. This shower mirror is currently the highest rated on Amazon and it is for a good reason!  This product was provided to me at no cost. All thoughts are unbiased and of my own opinion.</li>
    <li> I really like this and the razor holder. Adhesive hold well on my new ceramic tiled shower. It does fog up some if you have hot water going but takes a little longer to do so than a regular mirror. I have a small squeegee in my shower and a quick wipe of the mirror clears it up long enough for me to finish a shave even in if it&#x27;s a hot shower. You can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> This works great but it is not REALLY fogless, but that is not a problem.  When it fogs up splashing some water on it clears it right off long enough to shave. It is thin and big enough for easy shaving, but not so big as to take up much room.  I mounted mine on a glass shower door with the vanity light beyond, so lighting is good.  A watch out: make certain it is stuck where you will be happy.  The adhesive is VERY strong.  I wish I had stuck it on the other shower door, but it will not come off without ruining the adhesive.  It stays where you out it.  Overall much better than the suction cup designs.  It will not come off and break like they always seem to.</li>
    <li> Great mirror and fantastic service from the vendor. My husband loves this mirror for shaving.</li>
    <li> Purchased about 6 months ago and after about 1 month it started to get foggy (completely useless after 2 months). It&#x27;s to the point now where it fogs up after less than 5 minutes in the shower. As directed I&#x27;ve never used any cleaning agents other than just water to clean it.</li>
    <li> The Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror thus far has been exactly as advertised.  No complaints.  The price is better than most \\&quot;claimed\\&quot; fogless and it really really works.  Now, I&#x27;ve only had it about a month so we&#x27;ll see over time.  Quick spray with the show head and it&#x27;s clear and remains so right through the shave.  Easy to install, safe to use (not glass) and light weight.  The mount for the hook and for your shaver work great and easy to install.    FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS!!!  DO NOT USE ANY CHEMICALS TO CLEAN THE MIRROR!    You&#x27;ll get a ton of emails from Cassani telling you this while waiting for it to show up and likely because they&#x27;ve had people NOT follow the instructions.    Works, easy to install, no brainer, good price, better than anything else I&#x27;ve used over the years including an expensive Brookstone model that crapped out in the first month.    November 14th 2014 Update:  I&#x27;ve downgraded my rating on the Cassini from 5 stars to 2.  I&#x27;ve not used any cleaner on this mirror and it started fogging up about three months ago.  The mirror has water spots that won&#x27;t come off.  I had a lot of hope for this mirror but time to look for something else...</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband and he&#x27;s happy with it. We followed the instructions and placed it towards the back of the shower so it doesn&#x27;t get wet.  Works great.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror as a gift for my husband and he loves it. He&#x27;s so impressed with the fact that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;still&amp;#34; fogless. It&#x27;s super easy to hang and great to use. Thanks so much for a great product.</li>
    <li> Only had a few days, but so far so good. We&#x27;ll see how long the tape sticks!</li>
    <li> Simple, easy, affordable, and it works. I gave up looking for the reasonably priced &amp;#34;radio/shower mirror&amp;#34; after a few mediocre products in a row. Not only did they still fog up, but the radio reception was usually god-awful. Then I saw this straight forward stand alone shower mirror that I can just hang on the shower head pipe with some string. I had heavier &amp;#34;dual purpose&amp;#34; units come loose (suction cups), only to bruise my foot and/or chip the shower floor. This thing is so light and handy, there&#x27;s no chance of that now. It stays fog free once I quickly rub a little soapy water on it. And it stays out of the way otherwise. I wonder whether the backer will last over time, and when subjected to so much moisture, but so far, so good after a few weeks. If you are so addicted to radio noise; just turn up the volume on a regular one elsewhere in the bathroom before jumping in the shower.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if the hook that comes with it is meant to be permanent or removable.  When I posted my question on Amazon the company got back to be in less than a day and explained that it&#x27;s permanent and they recommend using something like the 3M removable ones for people that rent. My boyfriend loves the mirror.  It is definitely fogless and is light enough weight to use with the removable hook we bought.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s better than mirrors that aren&#x27;t fogless but I find it does still fog up.  Usually when this happens I take it off the wall, or splash some water on it to heat it up again and it stops fogging.  It&#x27;s very important that I see myself...hold on, let me take a selfie...all the time so this product was a MUST for me!</li>
    <li> Works great tried other brands!!!! Good price would highly recommend thank you!!!!!</li>
    <li> The mirror is clear and doesn&#x27;t fog up. Easy to put together, and it has a lot of surface area.  The appearance is pleasing.</li>
    <li> great mirror, great customer service, fast shipping!  i would definitely recommend this product to anyone else who asked me if they needed a mirror for their shower.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly and super easy to install. Comes with very strong adhesives so make sure you are hanging it up in the correct spot the first time. I would definitely recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> The mirror still gets fogged and isn&#x27;t any higher quality than any of the fog less mirrors that I&#x27;ve sued in the past.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.  It would make more sense to splurge a little more with money and get a product that actually works.</li>
    <li> After a month with this shower mirror it works as well as the first day.  No fog, stays clean, and even with the small size you get a good field of vision.  My old mirror with suction cups consistently fell off of the tile, while this application system seems secure, and allows for easy removal of the mirror if it needs cleaning.</li>
    <li> Article is working very well, I am very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I like a hot shower and this mirror still gets foggy&lt;br /&gt;I placed it on the opposite side of the shower so it wouldn&#x27;t get wet, good but gets foggy</li>
    <li> I wear false eyelashes and for the longest time I&#x27;ve needed to wash my face in the shower without messing up my lashes. now I can with my mirror. I&#x27;ve had no problems and if the mirror fogs up run water over Then hang it back on the wall.  I put my mirror to the back of me face height.</li>
    <li> Foged up after 3 weeks from water film</li>
    <li> Previously my husband has gone through at least a dozen different shower mirrors from other manufacturers.  Alas, they either don&#x27;t stay up or they fog up badly.&lt;br /&gt;But he feels like he has finally found the one and only mirror he&#x27;ll ever need.  He&#x27;s been using this one for over a month now and it is excellent!!!!!  Thanks to all of the previous Amazon positive reviewers for recommending it.  We might not have bothered trying it, if not for the large numbers of 5 star reviews.</li>
    <li> This mirror works great, it&#x27;s exactly as described fogless fogless even with the hottest water level and the bathroom close. I would definitely recommend this specially for men who like to shave in the shower, cause it&#x27;s better for skin no more bumps or cuts. Love it.</li>
    <li> it was fogless for 1 day. The rest, just like any other mirror.</li>
    <li> working perfectly so far</li>
    <li> The reflection was great and is truely a fogless mirror. It was easy to install in the shower by just attaching the hook to the wall in the shower and hanging the mirror on the hook. My husband uses it all the time to shave and loves it. I highly recommend this product. You can find the Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror Here. I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.[[ASIN:B00CNOUZE2 Fogless Shower Mirror - Guaranteed Fog Free - Exclusive to Amazon - No Suction Cups - Designed Not to Fall - Ultra-easy Set up - Includes Additional Razor Wall Mount]]</li>
    <li> I was so happy to get a fogless shower mirror that actually works! I take very hot showers and my bathroom is always filled with fog. This mirror stayed completely clear. Also the mirror isn&#x27;t at all distorted. So many shower mirror are like carnival mirrors. This shower mirror&#x27;s reflection is perfect. Excellent for men to shave in the shower and perfect for women to remove their makeup or wash their face.</li>
    <li> Love this mirror! It will get a bit foggy if you like taking burning hot showers like I do, but works great!</li>
    <li> Its ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First unit I got always fogged up. The manufacturer were awesome about sending me a second unit replacement at no charge right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second unit worked fog free for a few days and now fogs up pretty much instantly. Holding it under water will allow it to defog for maybe 30-1 min so I have to do it a couple of times to get through a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So net, not fog free...but maybe &#x27;fog resistant&#x27;,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror itself is just a think piece of plastic, so nothing to write home about. Pretty modern looking but doesn&#x27;t stick out aesthetically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I followed all the instructions and didn&#x27;t clean the unit or anything that could impact the finish.</li>
    <li> I have had many shave mirrors in my life but I would have to say this one is the best. It&#x27;s a minimalist design with a very small footprint but highly effective. It&#x27;s exactly what you want in your shower functional and quiet.</li>
    <li> It fogs all the time...</li>
    <li> I received a replacement mirror within a week when the first one was not working well. I had received a email that they had a batch of mirros that were not upto standards.</li>
    <li> Mirror attracts fog so the claim of fogless is smitten with fraud.  I must throw water on the mirror to see my face.  It was easy to install, but beyond that it is not what Cassani claimed, a fogless mirror.</li>
    <li> Now, when I read that it was an &amp;#34;anti-fog&amp;#34; mirror, I was beyond curious to see how that would work. I mean, the huge mirror on the wall in the bathroom fogs up in a matter of minutes after turning on a warm or hot shower. This mirror actually goes inside of the shower, even closer to the water source.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was very easy to install. The metal hook attaches to your wall with a strong adhesive backing. It&#x27;s a good idea to make sure to clean the area that you are trying to adhere it to. The mirror has a thin plastic film that you remove from the front and a brown paper to remove from the backside before hanging from the metal hook. An additional hook does come with, to hang your razor from. I actually hang my konjac face sponge from it, since I use this mirror every morning and evening to thoroughly wash my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size of the mirror is just big enough to see my entire face. I really like that it&#x27;s not too big and not too small either.&lt;br /&gt;This mirror is really nice in the shower because I can clearly see my face while washing. It has made my showering routine just a bit easier, and I love that.&lt;br /&gt;Does it ever fog up?&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, it only fogs up if the water is too hot, or if I don&#x27;t clean the glass occasionally. I make sure to clean it with water any my hand, as instructed, and voila, fog-free again for days.&lt;br /&gt;It DOES NOT fog up the way the big mirror in the bathroom does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received a Cassini Fogless Shower Mirror for reviewing purposes. All opinions stated here are solely my own and in no way influenced. No other compensation was received.</li>
    <li> We love this! My husband uses it more then I do, but I love it to! We have tried a couple different ones and have never really liked them.  But this one...... Heck yes!! It works  great and is easy to put up.</li>
    <li> This mirror worked great for about a week, then it started fogging up everytime i used it. I have not wiped it with anything. I just rinse it off and use before it fogs again. I could do the same thing with a two dollar mirror rather than paying fifteen for yours. Any suggestions?</li>
    <li> Extremely disappointed with this product. I have never felt so deceived into buying such a worthless product for 10 times what it probably cost to make. I followed all instructions for cleaning this mirror and it still constantly fogs up every 10 seconds. Water droplets stick like glue to the mirror which make seeing yourself clearly while shaving impossible. False advertising to the max. DO NOT BUY THIS MIRROR.</li>
    <li> Product Pictures always looks nice on the box but do the products work. I can tell you with certainty that Cassani&#x27;s Fogless Mirror works to perfection. We have one hanging in our shower right now and my husband  gave it a big thumb up. Cassani has improved their fogless mirror and it has a nice modern oval design. The new oval design gives the mirror added width and height to match the shape of your face including your  neckline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fogless mirror has a hole punch on the top and we have ours hanging on the hook at the bottom of our shower caddy.  It&#x27;s the perfect spot because all of our shaving supplies are stored there and you can check yourself out at a glance anytime you are in the shower. You can also lift the mirror right off the hook and change the location of the mirror at any time. The Cassani Fogless Mirror allows you to shave and you can actually see yourself. Cassani&#x27;s Fogless mirror also includes two stainless steel adhesive wall mounts which will give you other hanging options. You can attach the mirror and razor on the wall mounts. If you are not completely satisfied, there is a  &amp;#34;Hassle-Free 100% MoneyBack Guarantee if you are not fully satisfied.&amp;#34; Cassani Fogless Mirror is definitely a &amp;#34;must-have&amp;#34; in the shower.</li>
    <li> Great size, easy installation, hasn&#x27;t fogged yet. I plan to be very careful not to use soap or a washcloth, as I don&#x27;t want to mess this one up!</li>
    <li> Product works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus the company sends great follow up emails if you have any problems.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks and it works as advertised.  It is also easy to put up.  It doesn&#x27;t fog.  I splash a little water on it right before I start to shave to get the water spray off of it.  So far so good.</li>
    <li> This mirror fogged up after a couple months of use.</li>
    <li> Like others have said, this is a great mirror. Fogless and with quick rinse of water, it&#x27;s like... a mirror! &#x3D;p  I bought this packet because I wanted the hook too.  Had to bend that a bit to make it work with the Gillette Sensor.  Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> My husband and I love this shower mirror.  It is so nice to be able to have a mirror in the shower, especially one that is actually usable and doesn&#x27;t fog up.  You do have to remember to run the back under warm water first or it can fog up but even then the fog is easily wiped away and then stays gone.  This is a most have for any shower.  Male or female this mirror is awesome to have!</li>
    <li> Love it! Hubby can shave in shower, my sink is no longer covered in hair. Plus I use it to ensure I remove my make up when showering. The razor hook is convient as well. Great purchase. Company follows up to ensure satisfaction.</li>
    <li> Great mirror!  Easy to put up, stays clear in the shower, stays put.  Great value for a product that works great.  Razor holder is a nice bonus.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of the mirror because I can do my facial cleansing in the shower! That alleviates the mess at the sink and hassle of taking longer in the bathroom on a busy day! I can see my face and neck clearly in the mirror!</li>
    <li> I purchased the mirror for my husband so that he could shave while showering.  He is very pleased with the mirror which has since been faultless.  It has never fogged over and the special mount has been solid even in the moist environment.</li>
    <li> REMEMBER TO TELL YOUR WIFE NOT TO CLEAN IT! This is my second Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror and they are the absolute best on the market. I had my first one for over a year and I believe it would have gone on working perfectly forever. Unfortunately my wife decided that its spotless surface needed a cleaning with Windex. OOPS! No longer fogless (they tell you that right in the instructions but I guess I never mentioned it to her). Anyway, The un-Windxed mirror works perfectly. When it does get little water droplets on it a quick spritz with the hot shower clears it and it stays clear. It&#x27;s attractive in appearance and the perfect size for shaving and the brushed stainless steel brackets for the mirror and a razor also fit with my brushed nickel fixtures and I think would work equally well with stainless and chrome finished bathroom fixtures. Finally, the adhesive mounting strips for the brackets work perfectly and show no signs or loosening. Since the originals were still perfect, I didn&#x27;t bother to replace them.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve had this mirror up for a little bit now. I wanted to see how it would hold up to our mineral filled water. We live on well water and I was afraid that it make the mirror not stick properly or the mirror itself would get covered in the mineral deposits from being in the shower all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I can tell you. One, I&#x27;ve never seen it fog up! EVER! Two, it sticks great even with the minerals in our water. Three, repeals not just the fog but also the mineral deposits on the mirror itself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those three things alone make this a great buy, but it also is great if you need a mirror in the shower. We&#x27;ve all had those moments where a stray lash goes into your eye and you have to suffer through it until you can get out of the shower or if you ever need to get a spot you can&#x27;t see with your razor- perfect little mirror for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it also comes with a razor holder!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, two thumbs up. This is a great shower mirror that does everything it says it does and more. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Mirror works as expected.  It may get fogged, but if you run it under the shower it maintains its &amp;#34;foglessness&amp;#34;.  Stuck it on the shower wall a month ago, there it has stayed.  Great price, actually the best price I could find for a fogless shower mirror.  Very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> The mirrors is made with Anti-Fog Nanotechnology which keeps your reflection clear in the warmest of showers. Believe me, I put this mirror to the test. I take some ridiculously hot showers and the Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror never fogged!!! To add to the amazement of the mirror is it&#x27;s shatterproof!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I have to admit the most amazing part was my husband was able to hang the mirror all by himself!&lt;br /&gt; I didn&#x27;t even get the change to take it out of the box. He came home and set it up while I was sleeping. I guess he likes it too! lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty easy to set up. If my husband can do it without me reading the directions to him than anyone can do it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror comes with 2 Stainless steel mounts. One for the mirror and one to hold your razor. My husband LOVES that! It keeps his razor where he can find it and out of reach of our little girls. To set the hooks up just wipe the sport where you want it with rubbing alcohol and let it dry completely. Then remove the backing from the stainless steel hook, apply where you want it, and hold pressure for 45 seconds. Then don&#x27;t get it wet for at least 24 hours. And they are ready to go! My husband already rants and raves about how much better his skin feels when he shave in the shower. He suffers from horrible razor burn. His skin becomes inflamed, red, and irritated. Since he&#x27;s been using the Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror and shaving in the shower, his irritation has been cut by more than half.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;ll tell you the absolute best part of having the Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror. NO MORE STUBBLE ALL OVER MY BATHROOM SINK!!! IT&#x27;S A MIRACLE!!! I can&#x27;t sing the praises high enough!! I HATED having to wash and rinse off everything after my husband shaved. It&#x27;s disgusting and annoying. Those little hairs stick everywhere. But now, all those nasty hairs just go down the drain or simple rinse with the shower head and everything looks clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Do not use window cleaner on the fogless mirror!! It can affect the Anti-Fog Nanotechnology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the quality of the Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror!!Do not use window cleaner on the fogless mirror!! It can affect the Anti-Fog Nanotechnology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the quality of the Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror!!</li>
    <li> this device does everything that i wanted in a shower mirror .  perfect for shaving in the shower .  it would be nice to have included two razor holders ( one for my wife )</li>
    <li> Works exactly as promised and looks great in the shower. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a shower mirror.</li>
    <li> The mirror doesn&#x27;t fog up, but I did have an issue with the bottom piece that holds the razor fall off my shower wall once after just a day or two. After just putting it back on with the original adhesive, it&#x27;s been on for a couple weeks and have had no issues.</li>
    <li> Great mirror, doesn&#x27;t fog and the water is always smooth on it so when it gets wet you don&#x27;t have water spots in the way of your vision. Very clear.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this mirror to be able to shave in the shower.  It&#x27;s super convenient and eliminates the mess he used to leave around the sink.  Just wish there was a way to make it so it didn&#x27;t have water spots all over it after you shower.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using this for over a month now, and it&#x27;s perfect in so many ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Totally FOGLESS... take it off the hook, run it under the shower stream for a couple of seconds, and you&#x27;re in fogless nirvana! Just like they say!&lt;br /&gt;2. Perfect size for shaving face.&lt;br /&gt;3. Frameless, minimalist look. No ugly plastic, or rim that gets icky over time!&lt;br /&gt;4. Lovely stainless steel wall mount. No yucky suction cups!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very satisfied!</li>
    <li> this is exactly what I wanted. I had another one for 3 years but was smaller.  This one is bigger and came with very clear instructions on  how to clean.</li>
    <li> This mirror does everything that was claimed. It hangs on the wall, it stays fogless after holding it under the warm shower, it&#x27;s easy to install and everything I needed was included. I would prefer a larger mirror, but the size is adequate (and it&#x27;s significantly larger than the &amp;#34;attach to the shower head&amp;#34; mirror which I formerly used.</li>
    <li> I have looked for a while for a shower mirror that works and this one does. It will fog up if you take really hot showers like I do, but a quick rinse under the water and it stays fog free for the rest of the shower (which is exactly what the instructions say that come with it, it will fog, but get it wet and it&#x27;s good to go). It also has a very clear image unlike some of the others that tend to turn into funny circus mirrors after a few showers due to warping. I&#x27;ve had this one for a few weeks now and it has been awesome!</li>
    <li> Arrived fast and works just as described.  The wife is happy that the whiskers aren&#x27;t all over the bathroom sink anymore.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband and he loves it.  Makes shaving easy in the shower and cuts down on his getting ready time.</li>
    <li> Very nice sized mirror - surprisingly big compared to others I have used. I like hot showers, and this stays fog-free the entire time. It also stays clean; I had problems with water spots and soap spots on past mirrors. For whatever reason, this mirror really stays clean. Everything just seems to run off it. And, love the hanging hooks, for both the mirror and razor. Great product, great value.</li>
    <li> This mirror worked as advertised for a month or so, but now it seems to have lost most of it&#x27;s antifog properties. It doesn&#x27;t fog up as much as a conventional mirror would, but there is a very noticable difference between when I bought it and now.</li>
    <li> GREAT buy!!  This was exactly what we wanted.  It&#x27;s larger than I thought it would be and easy to see everything clearly.  It IS fogless!  I am so glad we purchased this mirror.  I just wish we would&#x27;ve sooner.</li>
    <li> Easily mounted to shower wall and great to use for women too! I can use use it to wash my face and my partner can use it to shave while in the shower! Good product.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. This is not fogless at all. It fogs just as bad as your regular medicine cabinet mirror.</li>
    <li> like to trim my hair in the shower and avoid a mess all over the bathroom...this mirror is the answer!</li>
    <li> Mirror works as expected- got for my husband to use for shaving in the shower. The shape looks nice, and it hangs firmly and securely. Overall, a good product and my husband has no complaints!</li>
    <li> Perfect..So easy to install in seconds and never fogs!!! We both love this. My husband now loves shaving in the shower and I love his closer shaves!</li>
    <li> Fogless feature lasted for a few showers, then it began to fog.  It now is aggravating to the point of having to shave after my shower instead of during.  It has been three weeks and I have to rinse the shower free of fog two or three times per shower to see myself clearly, this after following installation instructions to the word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package came with a warm and fuzzy welcome message that made me feel good about my purchase, which is all well and good, but if the product does not work, it means nothing.  I have given it a chance and will give it another few showers before I get tired of regularly rinsing it clear, then I will look for a different brand.</li>
    <li> Worked good but after a few months began to get soap scum all over it ruining the mirror.</li>
    <li> Yes it gets 80% foggy after a few uses but i dont mount mine and just give it a quick hand wipe to clear it</li>
    <li> I have a shower wand that I can spray the shower and the Fogless Shower Mirror with.  I just spray it once and I can put on my shaving cream and complete the shave.  I would purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work. It fogs quicky when shower gets hot. Must keep putting under shower to defog.</li>
    <li> As described and promised. Functions very well.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised that it came with shaving razor wall mount. It&#x27;s just the perfect bonus accessory! Of course, I am too excited for Hubby to try it so I installed it in our shower immediately. The mirror is just the perfect size to clearly see the whole face and neck area for a cleaner, closer and easier shave. And the fact that it is shatterproof is just fantastic! I also love the stainless steel mirror wall mount and the stainless steel razor wall mount. I think they are very modern and sleekly-designed. Plus, they are very easy to install. But most of all, I just love that it is really FOGLESS!</li>
    <li> The mirror fogs every single time I am in the shower. They said it was a defective product and that they would send me a new one but nothing ever came.. Would not recommend this mirror to anyone.</li>
    <li> The Cassani Fogless Shower mirror is just what you need for shaving in the shower, or for us ladies, washing away the day&#x27;s makeup. Not only is it fogless, but it is also completely shatterproof. I don&#x27;t think you will have to worry about it hitting the bottom of the shower though. It hangs on a super sturdy stainless steel hook, not a flimsy suction cup. All you have to do is find a clean, dry surface to hang your mirror, peel the back off the sticky pad on the mount, and press to apply. I gave it a few tugs to make sure it was secure, but it didn&#x27;t budge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also included with the mirror is a matching stainless steel razor mount. This mount works great for keeping your razor right where you want it. I tried a few different razors and they all fit perfectly. I love that I can put it up high to keep it out of reach of my kids. It attaches to your shower wall the same as the mirror mount, with a really tough sticky pad.&lt;br /&gt;So does it work? Absolutely! The Cassani Fogless Shower mirror is truly fog-proof! Even in the hottest shower, I can still see to wash my makeup off. No more creepy raccoon eyes when I emerge from the shower and wipe off the (non fogless!) bathroom mirror. Instead, I get out of the shower looking like I actually washed my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband is currently bearded, so he cannot attest to how well it works for shaving. I&#x27;m sure once it warms up outside he will be shaving it off, though. A huge plus is that there won&#x27;t be hair on the sink when he is finished. No clean up required!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what these people are talking about- must be friends of the manufacturer or something.  It fogs up within about ten minutes, and my shower doesn&#x27;t even get that steamy!  I&#x27;m not expecting a flawless mirror, but I have to wipe it multiple times during a shave, it&#x27;s not doing it&#x27;s job. Would not recommend. And I would be very suspicious of anyone who would.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. doesn&#x27;t fog. I don&#x27;t even clean it.</li>
    <li> The good:&lt;br /&gt;the optics are super high quality. If it does fog up you rinse it once and it&#x27;ll stay defogged for a solid 10 - 15min. Super lightweight. Super strong mounts for mirror and razor hook. Sharp looking. I love it. I mean i absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The so so: when I first used it, it stayed fog free for a whole long shower.The second time I used it, it fogged up quickly, but as I stated above, if you rinse it it stays defogged for a long time. And my routine accommodates this, because I always shave towards the end of the shower when my facial hair is all warm and soft. So I let it fog up, I do everything else I have to do, and just before im about to shave, i run it under the water for a split second and I&#x27;m good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technically, this means it&#x27;s not 100% fog free; but it is a beautiful mirror and super sharp and crystal-clear, and is indescribably better then any non-fog free mirror I&#x27;ve ever jerryrigged my shower before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  although I didn&#x27;t notice this at first because you can&#x27;t see it when looking at the mirror from shaving distances, from far away on the top left side there is a defect in the mirror; a concavity almost as if a golf ball was pressed on the mirror when was formed. A super shallow concavity about that size.  Again, from shaving distances this defect is absolutely invisible; imperceptible.  so once again, for the price, and considering the overall quality, it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for these reasons, I gave it four stars; but I like it so much I am actually fighting back giving itfive stars.</li>
    <li> In about 2 days, it wasn&#x27;t fog less anymore. I haven&#x27;t used any cleaning products except for just water, which is also filtered. Pretty disappointed because it looks nice.</li>
    <li> This is a very affordable solution for the purpose of having a shower mirror. It works well as long as instructions are observed.</li>
    <li> I should have bought one of these years ago.  It&#x27;s so great!!!  It recommends to run the mirror under water before each use, but I haven&#x27;t, and it still works great!  My husband can now shave in the shower, and it&#x27;s nice to see myself when I&#x27;m scrubbing my face.</li>
    <li> It worked flawlessly when I got it...however, after some time when I had to rinse it, it began fogging up immediately. The seller was kind enough to send me a replacement one at no cost but the same problem began occurring after rinsing it too. Based on the cleaning directions, I didn&#x27;t use any household cleaners on it to preserve the fogless layering. The mirror is useless when showering.</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money. Fogs up after shower gets warm</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror to replace a mirror I purchased at Brookstone years ago. I like the simplicity of it. Easy to mount and actually stays fogless. Seems a little warped in some spots but not really an issue. I&#x27;m pretty happy with this mirror.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t believe how great it works especially for this price! we  have gone through all of the Sharper Image $45 fogless mirrors and they fog up. This is awesome!</li>
    <li> It is a solid plastic mirror. It has a good reflection and came with two hooks that hold it firmly in place.</li>
    <li> I’m a BuView.com participant &amp; receive sample products from various companies to try, share and then give my honest and own opinion about the product(s) I received. #ReviewsThatBuzz  1) What did you most like/dislike about the product?  Like: Lightweight, easy to handle/hold/hang, good shape and size for utilization in the shower for shaving or face cleansing.  Dislike: Very thin, backing material appears to be wafer thin adhesive like paper. Mirror reflective surface is delicate. It scratches very easy during normal cleaning (remove water-spots/soap). I even used a soft, non-bristle, cloth, yet it still left visible non removable marks on the reflective surface.  2) What do you think about the overall quality &amp; usefulness of the product?  Quality: Fair overall; Even though it is shatter proof the thickness is quite thin that if its accidentally stepped upon at an angle its possible it will break in half.  Usefulness: Good: For the intended purpose of this product it is nice and handy in the shower. We&#x27;re able to preform the necessary personal grooming within half the time it would take if needing to preform these at the bathroom sink. As well on the plus side, when better half shaves in the shower now, my bathroom surfaces have a significant reduction of left behind little stubble/whisker hairs on all my porcelain surfaces.  NOTE: I found for this mirror to be at its fullest effectiveness,the front reflective surface (&amp; back) of the mirror must be completely saturated with water in order for the mirror to stay 90% Fog-free.  3) Could you suggest possible improvements to the product?  a) Making it a little thicker. I understand it&#x27;s thin to help eliminate the fog on the surface of the mirror. But those of us with children, would more than likely agree, to prevent little ones from the temptation of &amp;#34;trying to break it&amp;#34; the thickness could be increased a little more.  b) Include a glass cleaning cloth to help prevent scratches on the mirrors surface.  4) Would you buy the product?  YES  5) Would you recommend it to others?  YES  6) Please score it between 1 and 10.  7.5</li>
    <li> Super quick delivery  great product big and yessss it works great</li>
    <li> Good solution. It works well.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it. I had ones with light and batteries, etc..they dont last long in the shower. this is good enough.</li>
    <li> This mirror is simply awful. Fogged up within 10 seconds. I contacted their customer service and they sent me another one. They said my first one must have been defective. Put the new one up...same thing fogs up almost immediately. I wanted to like this mirror. The price was right and installation was a breeze. Just does not work!</li>
    <li> Most of the reviews on this product are good.  My product was defective out of the box.  Everything was in tact when I recieved it, and it wall mounted perfectly, just as advertised.  I even received a personal email from the company giving me instructions on how to set it up and use it correctly.  The first time I turned on my shower, and every time since then, it fogged up immediately.  I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.  I even threw the box away (which I never do) so I don&#x27;t even think I&#x27;ll be able to send it back.  And to be clear, it&#x27;s not like the mirror &amp;#34;kind of fogged up,&amp;#34; it&#x27;s like it was missing the fog protection chemicals all together.  Like they somehow missed this particular mirror when manufacturing them.  Maybe others had better luck but not me.</li>
    <li> So far this product has been working wonderfully. I had no problems getting it put up in my shower and there has been no fogging whatsoever! Cassani Company has been wonderful and has kept in touch to ensure that I am happy with their product. Great buying experience!</li>
    <li> Got mine a few months ago. Worked great until the cleaning lady used an abrasive sponge to clean it. But it worked great prior to that. Going to order another and hide it from the cleaning lady</li>
    <li> this is a wonderful mirror fore the shower--easy to install, simple and elegant.  Just be sure to take the brown covering off the back,</li>
    <li> Fantastic mirror!!! Performs just as advertised.  Easy to install and does not fog up. Enjoy your nicely shaved face people.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s almost perfect but you need to rinse it off, then use it. It starts to fog after 5 minutes or so. Not bad - just in spots. Its too bad its not perfect because it hangs nice int he shower, I like the separate razor hanger. Would I get another - maybe.....</li>
    <li> Great mirror! Works flawlessly, and you don&#x27;t have to use the hooks if you don&#x27;t want to, i&#x27;m hanging it from one of the hooks on my shower shelf.</li>
    <li> So, it works as advertised, for about a month. Then, the film on it starts bubbling off and you lose the &amp;#34;fogproof&amp;#34; in that area. Eventually, it fails on the whole surface.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly until the film washes off even after following the instructions of care. Unless you are ok with buying it every couple of months, don&#x27;t buy it</li>
    <li> There is just no miracle shower mirror on the market. This one gets foggy too. A splash of the hot water clears it up, though. You might need a couple of those splashes during your shaving session.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: the mirror is very lightweight and a hook is very handy. I think, because of the weight, adhesive hook will stay in place forever (at least it should). No wall drilling is definitely a benefit.&lt;br /&gt;This product is good what it was made for. Just don&#x27;t fall into &#x27;no-foggy&#x27; advertising for this item (or any shower mirror).</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. Has hook to hang it on so it can be put at any level. I&#x27;ve had it for a month now and it stays clear all the time. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product, love shaving in the shower, and this product makes it much easier and more enjoyable.</li>
    <li> This is the one tI get folks!</li>
    <li> I received a discount coupon to purchase this mirror, a mirror that doesn’t get foggy when you shower? I liked that!&lt;br /&gt;I have little kids and work full time so every minute in the morning counts.&lt;br /&gt;Every morning after I shower I have 2 minutes that I could use putting lotion on my face, make up, etc..but if I have to start cleaning the mirror because it is foggy, I don’t do it..every minute counts in the morning!!&lt;br /&gt;So I installed the mirror (very easy) and… who said this is only for men??&lt;br /&gt;I loved it!! A fog-less mirror in a foggy bathroom, how awesome is that? Out of the shower, lotion and concealer on my face, the rest of the make up at my little ones school parking..&lt;br /&gt;The mirror design is classic so it matches every style, and it does what it promises. Loved it!</li>
    <li> Started to fog up after one week of use. I figured this would happen with the price point it&#x27;s at but just one week. Next time I will spend a little more money for a better product.</li>
    <li> it works for the first shower and then it&#x27;s like every other mirror where you need to splash water on it every 5 seconds.</li>
    <li> It appears many use this mirror to shave but I actually use it when cutting my hair in the bathtub.  I suppose if one were to shave with it one would place the mirror towards one end of the bathtub, but cutting one&#x27;s own hair requires some room so the mirror is placed in the center of the tub.  This placement was problematic with other mirrors I&#x27;ve tried because I&#x27;d occasionally knock them out of place while taking a shower, eventually breaking the mirror and damaging the tub.  But this mirror is super low profile - it is frameless and sits maybe 1mm away from the wall, just enough to allow the air to circulate and dry the tile after a shower.  It&#x27;s ingenious!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clarity of the mirror itself is also impressive.  While it does not appear to be a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; mirror made of glass (so it&#x27;s neither heavy nor does it feel like it will break easy), it maintains a clarity better than any other bath mirror I&#x27;ve tried - there is no warpage of the reflection nor any distortion.  It does appear to have a slightly magnifying effect, and on the first usage (before any water touched it) it appeared to have a slight honeycomb-like distortion pattern that eventually went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The backing of the mirror appears to be a brown paper-like material so I was a bit concerned of soakage or a mildew build-up.  It hasn&#x27;t had any problems so far, and each time I check during the day it&#x27;s completely dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one concern I have, like many others have also expressed here, is that I live in a rental apartment and that removing the mirror upon my moving out of the apartment may damage the tile upon which the mirror hook is glued.  The vendor assures us the adhesive can be removed without damaging the surface so I&#x27;ll take their word for it for now.  Or I may just decide to leave the mirror for the next tenant - I&#x27;m sure they won&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> i bought some of the other ones on here but this one is the best one i have found, comes with a hook for the mirror which is peel and bond thus very easy to install. and also had a razor hook!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;unit takes very little space in my shower and offers a good amount of mirror space, i can see my whole face on it while shaving. i bought one for both bathrooms in my home!</li>
    <li> First impression: The product came in a simple little box. My first thought was “Is this really going to work?” I took it out of the box and seen that it comes with two hooks. One hook is to hang the mirror on and the other hook is to hang your razor on, since this is meant for men that are shaving. I personally use it to apply my face masks and to take off my makeup since I usually do this in the shower. It looks as if there is cardboard on the back of the mirror, which immediately concerned me. I figured that the moisture in the bathroom would eventually ruin the mirror. The hooks come with adhesive on the back, which also concerned me because from my personal experience adhesive gets ruined when wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked?  It actually works! I was amazed. I definitely underestimated this product. I think it’s a really cool mirror. It does not fog up at all. I think this is a great product, especially for the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I did not like: I did not like the difficulty in cleaning. The instructions say to use water and a soft cloth, as if you were cleaning your sunglasses. I did just that and it was very difficult to get the pieces of dust off of it. I would definitely suggest using an actual washcloth and not a paper wipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See my full review Here:[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joyce</li>
    <li> does not remain fogless&lt;br /&gt;not sure why they say otherwise</li>
    <li> I have had this for about 7 months it was fine at first and now I can&#x27;t see anything through it. Fogs up in seconds. Not happy.</li>
    <li> It really works!  Shaving in the shower was never so easy.</li>
    <li> I should have been shaving in the shower!  This is great!  The mirror itself is excellent.  Large.  Truly fogless.  The hook that holds the mirror didn&#x27;t stick to the wall and it fell.  The other hook for the razor did stick - so I am hanging the mirror on that hook for now.  I think I may have not completely followed the directions and let the glue dry enough before hanging the mirror on it.  Otherwise a great product.  I even brought it with me once when traveling I love it so much.</li>
    <li> The first one I bought lasted one year before fogging. This one lasted only one week before fogging. Think I&#x27;ll spend a bit more money and try another brand.</li>
    <li> Been working fine for over a month.It scratches easily but I should have been more careful. I am a fan.</li>
    <li> Loved it then after a few months, it is fog-less, but the water beads up, and I can not see to shave...I have to run water  over it to shave.....pain in the ass then.......</li>
    <li> The mirror works great - just splash some water over it from the shower head and it stays fog free.</li>
    <li> Simple design, no suction cups to fail, and no fog!. I would have given it a five but I&#x27;ll reserve that last star for when the time comes to remove the adhesive that attaches the mirror and shaver holder to the tile.</li>
    <li> How can one beat this: simple, cheap, works perfectly, easy to put up.  Just a great product that delivers 100% with no fuss.</li>
    <li> Completely fogless - Keep it out of the water flow and give yourself a great shave in the comfort of a hot, steamy shower.  Then rinse your razor and hang it on the handy hook.  Both mirror and hook firmly are firmly attached to my shower door, and using them is a pleasure.</li>
    <li> I waited to write this review so we could really test this mirror to make sure the initial swoon factor wasn&#x27;t a fluke. Several showers later, it&#x27;s perfection and we&#x27;re still swooning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a fogless shower mirror that is actually fogless! I&#x27;ve paid crazy amounts of money only to be let down time and again. Without fail, I was wiping the fog from so-called fogless mirror after mirror. I was leery about this one given the extremely reasonable price which  is a lot less than others, but you know what they say - sometimes less is more! And what did we have to lose by giving this one a try, right? Well, less is more indeed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband is in the military and he has to have a close shave. He also shaves his head regularly and I&#x27;m not sure he could function without an in-shower mirror. I like to have it so I can make sure my facial cleansers have indeed done their jobs and there are no remnants of make-up left behind before I complete the rest of my skincare routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only possible downside is this mirror has no lights, so if you have a dimly lit shower it might harder to see, but that&#x27;s not a manufacturing defect. This one is the real deal, folks! There aren&#x27;t any bells and whistles. You open the basic packaging, hang it and go. No complicated installation and no worries about batteries or having to put water in some contraption to make it work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one definitely delivers. You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Love this product - the hook, that the mirror hangs to, remains well adhered to despite the heat, humidity and sometimes direct water contact within the shower.  It also remains fogless!  I have gone thru a number of mirrors purchased locally (Target, Walmart, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, etc) and they all failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only down side ... you can NOT clean the surface of the mirror with any chemicals.  I didn&#x27;t communicate this clearly enough with my cleaning person and she wiped down the mirror with a rag that had some vinegar residue on it, and the surface is now permanently streaked.  However I still believe that this is the best product out there and I&#x27;m reordering a new one today.</li>
    <li> I like this mirror because of its simplicity -- no frills.  But, it is effective and useful and it works for what it is intended for its use.  I like the fact also that the installation is a no brainer because the instruction is simple and direct.  I also like the additional razor hook.  From the moment I have this mirror installed in my shower, I now shave in the shower consistently and conveniently.  It works like &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; because if and when it gets droplets of water on its surface, all I do is run it under the shower and magically the mirror seems to clean itself providing clear and fogless image of your face.  I love this product and will buy again for the other bathrooms in our home.</li>
    <li> This product is all it is advertised to be and more.  It is easy to install, is the perfect size, and does not fog up. I like shaving in the shower and this mirror makes it very easy to do.  It&#x27;s lightweight and a great price.  I like the rack for my razor at the bottom.  The company e-mailed me tips on installing and using the mirror even before it arrived, and sent me another e-mail a few days later asking me to confirm I was satisfied and whether I had any questions.  I like a company that stands behind their product.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This mirror requires user to teach to tile wall in shower. I prefer to hand hold my mirror while shaving.</li>
    <li> We are reviewing the Fogless Shower Mirror. This mirror came in a great sized box, the packaging was neat and organized, and very easy to put together. I was very surprised on how well this product really worked! Alex used the mirror first he absolutely loved it. It was very convenient to shower and shave at the same time. He noticed that when he was shaving he didn&#x27;t get razor burn this time around. The mirror did not fog up as said and is great for everyone. I highly recommend anyone to get this product, it works amazing!</li>
    <li> The husband loves this for shaving his head and neck in the shower.  Now he can get it all done at once rather than showering, shaving, and then jumping back in the shower to rinse.</li>
    <li> Nothing wrong with it, but the supposed magic to keep the fog down does not work after about 3 weeks.  I only rinsed it with water, never let cleaning products touch it, but the anti-fog properties wore off.  Now it&#x27;s just a mirror.  That&#x27;s fine, but it was advertised as being anti-fog and it&#x27;s not after 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> Love the product.  It stays clear and if it has excess water on it from previous shower, you can just rinse it really quick to clear it up again.  Never fogs up so far.  I didn&#x27;t use the razor hook as I already had some in the shower.  I was confused by the cardboard in back of the mirror that didn&#x27;t want to come off -- so I left it on but think that is strange as its going to get wet over time?</li>
    <li> I originally bought this mirror about 3 years ago and loved it.  I used it everyday and could not say enough good about it.  Then, our cleaning lady decided to clean it with window cleaner.  Needless to say, it was  ruined.  I decided to replace it and ordered another from Amazon.  After all, it was pretty inexpensive and if I replace it every few years, it&#x27;s well worth the money.  The second mirror started out fine but after a couple of months, it would not clear.  It has water spots all over it and will not clear.  I am disappointed and considered replacing it again.  I decided to contact with the company, Cassani Company to see if there was anything I could do.  I have left 2 email messages on their customer support site and have not heard a word from them.  I hope someone there is reading the reviews here and will respond.  It says a lot about a company when they don&#x27;t reply to a customer inquiry.  Kind of makes me hope I can find another company that makes a similar mirror.</li>
    <li> Only used a few days now but it is working as advertised.  Installation was simple, reflection is very good and not a bit of fog so far.  Better starting experience than my two previous shower mirrors.  Update: After a couple of weeks it is apparent there is no &amp;#34;anti fog&amp;#34; technology of any significant value.   Mirror reflects well but you need to position so you can rinse with warm water.  It will fog up after a few minutes of the shower running.  Still simple to install and reflects well when rinsed.</li>
    <li> the &#x27;fogless&#x27; aspect of it is not exactly up to par. it kinda worked for the first 2 days but after that it fogs up a hellova lot</li>
    <li> The fogless feature works really well. The mirror measures roughly 8&amp;#34; x 6&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- The mirror comes with two hooks with self-adhesive tape: one to hang up a razor and another to hang up the mirror itself.&lt;br /&gt;- The mirror comes covered with a plastic sheet to avoid scratches in transit&lt;br /&gt;- The fogless coating works really well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- There is a distortion (spherical aberration) on the mirror. However, this is probably a one-off event. I don&#x27;t suppose all mirrors will have that.&lt;br /&gt;- I would not say that it&#x27;s ideal for travel, even though the product descriptions says otherwise. It is a mirror after all. It doesn&#x27;t have a protective edge either. The hook, once stuck on the wall with the tape, can&#x27;t be taken off and thus is not portable as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent the product by the manufacturer to sample and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: The manufacturer offered to replace my mirror free of charge due to the spherical aberration. I declined, since I can live with the aberration, but it&#x27;s the thought that counts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE2: After roughly 2 months, the fogless property has more or less disappeared. I have never cleaned it with anything apart from a spray of warm water from the shower (as the instructions suggest), but still the fogless property has gone. Now it remains fogged almost all the time unless I wipe it clean. I am taking a star off for that, because it is still a handy bathroom mirror with a strong hook, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t stay fogless for long.</li>
    <li> My husband loves his!!</li>
    <li> It stays virtually fog free until the shower gets too hot, then it gradually begins to fog up a bit.  I LOVE the hook design though because when it does, I just run it under the hot water for a second and I&#x27;m good to go.  My cheap plastic  framed one I had fogged in seconds and I had to splash water on it from across the shower to be able to use it.  Good riddance!!</li>
    <li> This mirror is perfect in the shower. True to the specs l, it does not fog up. It stays in place and it comes with a hook for your razor. Perfect gift for any man or for children learning how to wash their hair</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. It doesn&#x27;t fog. I would buy more if I had more showers but sadly I do not.</li>
    <li> Do you find when you get out of the shower all your mirrors are fogged up and you can&#x27;t apply your makeup? Or maybe hubby starts yelling can&#x27;t he can&#x27;t see to shave. Well no more with Cassari shower mirrors for shaving those days are over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror is designed to be used in the shower. Why shave in the shower well because it keeps your razor warm and clean, it helps relieve razor burn, and continuous hydration of your skin. all this plus no more whiskers in the skin ladies for us to clean up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each mirror comes with:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 1 Stainless Steel Mirror Wall Mount&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 Stainless Steel Shaving Razor Wall Mount&lt;br /&gt;1 Shatter-Proof Fogless Shower Mirror&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say my husband loved this mirror. He took it into the shower with him to try and prove it would fog up. After a 30 minute hot shower he brought it out laid it on the sink and well as you can tell from the above picture no fog. I was so excited it worked and so was hubby that he couldn&#x27;t wait to hang it up. This really is a great mirror and ladies we can use it to because it comes in use when your in the shower and you want to apply that mask to keep you young. It works perfect for that.</li>
    <li> Gave it 3 stars.. I didn&#x27;t wash this thing with any cleaners per the instructions but it even still it started fogging up withing about 2 weeks of owning it.  Now I just keep a cup in the shower so I can pour water over it a few times while I&#x27;m shaving so I can see....</li>
    <li> Disclosure: I got this product as part of an advertorial. &amp;lt;a href&#x3D;\\&quot;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;TOPb83bf45e16f28754b687fded92452a98\\&quot; rel&#x3D;\\&quot;nofollow\\&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned way too many shower mirrors than I&#x27;d like to admit. I have a sensitive face and just cannot shave outside of the shower. It&#x27;s been a nightmare trying to find something actually FOGLESS. This little jewel is just what it says it is. A no nonsense anti-fog mirror that is actually FOGLESS. It has not fogged up once since I got it. I cannot recommend it highly enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &amp;lt;a href&#x3D;\\&quot;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;BOTTOMb83bf45e16f28754b687fded92452a98\\&quot; rel&#x3D;\\&quot;nofollow\\&quot;&gt;Tomoson.com&amp;lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I wish I could&#x27;ve posted a nice review because the customer service for this company was great but the product just wasn&#x27;t up to par.  It was fogging up my first use, I followed the film removal instructions as they listed.  Still, the mirror instantly fogged up.  I emailed the company and they were nice enough to send me a replacement for free.  I tried again, same results.  Pretty disappointed since it would have been useful for my fiance who shaves in the shower.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> I was a little worried at the quality right out of the box, but I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised. My husband loves using this mirror in the shower and doesn&#x27;t have to keep rinsing fog away. You have to be pretty careful when cleaning it because even a damp washcloth scratches the surface, and don&#x27;t use cleaners or you&#x27;ll strip the film that makes it fogless. The hooks are holding up and have been up for about a month now with no signs of falling off the wall, and the razor hook is really convenient.</li>
    <li> This was truly easy to install and when I took a shower the mirror stayed crystal clear! It&#x27;s small enough that it doesn&#x27;t get in the way but big enough that I could see all of my head and neck.</li>
    <li> Works really really well. Clear as can be. No fogging. None. And it is a decent size. I use it every day and have nothing but positive thoughts.</li>
    <li> I believed the hype and have mistakenly purchased 2 of these mirrors over the last few months. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it does provide a good reflictive surface but only for about three weeks. I followed all of the instructions both times and I now start my day trying not to cut myself shaving since I can&#x27;t see a thing through this mirror.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase. It really doesn&#x27;t fog!</li>
    <li> There is nothing fogless about this mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T BUY!</li>
    <li> IT IS NOT FOGLESS! IT FOGS!!</li>
    <li> Picky husband loves it, easy to install too.</li>
    <li> fog free for about 3-4 months</li>
    <li> So far, great Mirror. Ive had it for about a month and it has worked very well. Recommended!</li>
    <li> This mirror is as advertised. It arrived promptly, installed easily, and works well.</li>
    <li> Great mirror!  I have been using it where I work out every morning. In the shower I hang it over the stall wall on an adjustable chord and it works very well.  Thanks a bunch.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I&#x27;ve had it 2 months so far and works beautifully. Worth the price...</li>
    <li> Everything it&#x27;s supposed to be.</li>
    <li> makes it easier  for my husband to shave in the shower and for me to wash my face! Great product would recommend to family and friends!</li>
    <li> Miror works exactly how it is suppose too.  Great Product!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best fogless shower mirror I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve used several -- been shaving in the shower for about fifteen years. It doesn&#x27;t Look fancy our anything, but the simplicity of its design makes it very effective.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll pretty much echo Keith F.&#x27;s review from 7/21/15.  The mirror works very well, for awhile, and then starts to lose its fog-prevention qualities.  I have to spray mine down before I start using it now and often one additional time mid-shave.  It&#x27;s still usable.  That said, I am about to buy another one as it works as well or better than any other &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; shower mirror I&#x27;ve ever owned and the price is good.  It&#x27;s mount is also much, much better than the suction cup mounts that so many mirrors of this type sport and since the mirror hangs on the provided hook, you can just keep using the hook from the first mirror over and over again rather than needing to re-apply a new hook.</li>
    <li> best designs are the simple ones. you get more than your money&#x27;s worth. very practical.</li>
    <li> Very large, no fog, I have it propped up on a shower shelf where it is perfect</li>
    <li> great mirror - my husband loved it!  easy to add to shower and really is fogless!</li>
    <li> awesome! No fogging at all and easy installation!</li>
    <li> So far this shower mirror has exceeded my expectations!  one of my frustrations with prior shower shaving mirrors was that they would fog in such a way that I&#x27;d find myself rubbing a layer of soap onto the mirror to stop them from fogging up.  With this mirror I no longer need to do that.  Now in the realm of full disclosure - the wall that this mirror is mounted on is an outside wall of the house, and given that I live in Minnesota, the wall temperature is typically cold - very cold!  ... so at the beginning of my shower, the mirror might fog up a bit.  This is because the mirror should at least be in the room temperature ballpark, that&#x27;s EASILY accomplished by holding the mirror under the shower stream for a few seconds, then very easily hanging it back on it&#x27;s hook.  BTW - The way the mirror hangs on the firmly mounted hook is ingenious, and done in such a way that it&#x27;s easy to remove and replace the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also .... Cassani&#x27;s communication through out the ordering process was also first class! ~ I give this product a solid 5 stars.  I&#x27;m tempted to purchase a second mirror ~ &#x27;just in case&#x27;  :^)</li>
    <li> Per the instructions, run some warm water over it and it never fogs.  Not glass so its not heavy and has a nice reflection.  Definitely recommend this for the shower.  Has a hanging hook and also comes with a blade razor hanger too.</li>
    <li> Fogless and easy to install. Just like it says on the box.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my husband. Works as promised and looks to be durable. Would highly recommend this mirror to all.</li>
    <li> Shaving in the shower has improved my skin tremendously. Since fogless mirrors can&#x27;t last forever, this simple, inexpensive one is the way to do it.</li>
    <li> Fogs right up, not much else to say.</li>
    <li> Great mirror for the price, I&#x27;ve had no issue with it fogging up at all, just followed the instructions for placement. I&#x27;ve used it for around 2 weeks now, every morning before work, might have to buy one for my other shower. Cassani has great customer service, has received tips and a willingness to help if I had issues.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised!!  Don&#x27;t ask me how but it is the best shower mirror I have evered owned!!  I recommend to anyone wanting a shower mirror.</li>
    <li> I have had five or more shower mirrors over the years.  This is the simplest and most lightweight one I have seen.  It sticks on glass or tile very easily and the mirror can be easily removed for cleaning, etc....  This is a very well designed product and I would highly recommend it for a great shower shave!</li>
    <li> Have tried a number of these things in the past.  None works perfectly but this one is pretty close.  No need for water running behind it or constantly rinsing both sides.  Love the included razor hanger as well.  Perfect size for shaving.</li>
    <li> Fog free and cheap. Stays mounted in the shower.  Buy it; bros like us deserve something nice every once in a while.</li>
    <li> I cannot comment on how long this one will last but so far this has been a good investment. It is nice and light stays fog free and is large enough to use while fitting nicely in the shower. The razor hanger is also quite useful. Nothing beats a shave in the shower! I have been through at least six of these type of mirrors and none of them have stayed fog free very long. Time will tell on this one but the first couple of weeks are encouraging. It was a good idea to separate the holder from the mirror since the suction cups most of these mirrors come with never stay attached for long especially on any kind of stone. You can just pull this one right off the hanger to rinse it off or even store it on a shelf between showers. Good design.</li>
    <li> 12/03/2015 UPDATE: Nice little mirror for the shower, however, if you look at my picture, you will quickly notice that it&#x27;s not exactly what most would consider &#x27;fogless.&#x27;</li>
    <li> I have had the fogless mirror now for about two months. So far it has met and exceeded all of my expectations. Now I am truly enjoying my showers in the morning. I love being able to shave in the  shower.</li>
    <li> My husband loves his mirror.  It works beautifully and is well worth the reasonable price.  So glad I found this because he had been wanting a shower mirror for a long time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day because he was using a tiny hand held mirror and he mentioned he would like something larger.  He loves it and says it makes a huge difference for shaving in the shower.  It comes with a hook to hang it on.  It looks very nice and the price was great too! I would definitely recommend this item.</li>
    <li> After using this for the first time I am annoyed that I used the other one for so long. I had the ToiletTree mirror with the water chamber that was such a PAIN (will write another review there). This thing works as expected and is so simple. For the first 10 minutes it was fogless without even rinsing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had any complaints they would be (1) no squeegee so the image was slightly distorted after I wet it and (2) the mirror hook should be shaped like the razor hook (rounded rather than straight) so that it isn&#x27;t so noticeable when I put it on crooked.</li>
    <li> Cassani fog-less mirror This nifty mirror for men to use while shaving the face in the mirror. Works for woman too. Who use acne products or shaving those hairs on the face, or just popping a pimple. This is really small which I like compared to those huge ones. Small is better. Hooks up to a hook. Depending on your walls in your shower which way is easier. I used the kind shown in the image. Suction doesn&#x27;t work great for ours. Then bam fog free. I love Hot Hot showers. It did just great in my shower. Never got fogged once. Does drip from the condensation which is better anyways. I just can&#x27;t get over how small it is, its so awesome.﻿</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this product. Not for me but for the husband. The hubby of course was not as excited because he said he likes his normal shaving routine. HIs normal routine consist of shaving over the bathroom sink. He shave everything. EVERYTHING. When he is done shaving then he hops in the shower. Notice how there wasn&#x27;t a statement in there about him cleaning up all the hair left around the sink and in the sink and on who knows what else. I always hate that part. The cleaning of the little itty bitty hairs that are everywhere. Im just glad they always miss the toothbrushes. So the next time he shaves I had asked him to use the mirror in the shower. I placed it in the shower so it was high enough for him to see into as I have absolutely no use to need a mirror for shaving in the shower. (I have used it to wash my face though) He said OK. However did he do it. No. He said he likes his normal routine and does not think he will change it just because there is now a nifty little mirror in the shower. I am hoping one day that will change. I have put the no fog mirror to test. It just does not fog. That is a great thing. It does get water droplets on it and I cannot stop that by placing it elsewhere because our shower is not that big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror was easy to hang. You just peeled off the backing of the hanging bracket and stick it where you want to hang your mirror. It was so easy my 7 year old could have done it. This also included a razor hook. It was just as easy to install as the mirror. It is also universal, almost any size, brand, style of razor fits on it. My husband likes bring able to hang his razor in the shower because it keeps it from gooing up on the moisture strip like it used to when just placed on the ledge in the shower.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly for me.  A couple of points:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I didn&#x27;t want to stick the hooks on my glass shower door.  I stumbled across a way around this at my local hardware store:  a clear plastic over-the-door wreath hook, of all things.  I didn&#x27;t need the razor holder, so no worries there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) My experience with this type of mirror is that it will start to fog up after awhile (though this one hasn&#x27;t yet for me).  I&#x27;ve found that if I put a tiny amount of shampoo on my finger and rub it over the mirror, it will completely stop fogging for several showers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror is very light and the reflected image is accurate.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This mirror is so simple.  You don&#x27;t have to attach it to a stream of water to keep it from fogging.  I don&#x27;t know how it works, but the other mirrors in my bathroom are covered in fog, and this mirror is completely clear.</li>
    <li> installed easily; no fog.  great purchase.  now if I can just shave without cutting myself, my morning shower will be wonderful.</li>
    <li> I had my doubts but when I read the other user comments I made the decision to purchase the mirror and have been extremely satisfied. I don&#x27;t know what kind of sorcerers technology is in this damned thing but I love it.</li>
    <li> Great mirror, does the job - just need someone to come mount it, because my husband didn&#x27;t think about the height for standing in the shower and just mounted it on the wall.  He has to squat now :)</li>
    <li> Liked the easy installation instructions and you&#x27;re good to go in a few hours after letting the adhesive set on the wall. Great fogless reflection, even in the \\&quot;spray\\&quot; zone. I highly recommend this if you use a manual razor.</li>
    <li> A great product!  Works exactly as advertised.  I use it to wash my face and make sure I get all my eye makeup off and it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> So far so good after 2 months.  Cheap, light and easy to install it has made shaving so much easier in the morning</li>
    <li> I really like the mirror and holders included.  I wish they would have command strip to make them easier to move if needed.</li>
    <li> It is a bit off-putting for their product description to only mention males as finding this item beneficial. We women shave in the shower as well, and do many other things where the mirror could be helpful. That was the only thing that I did not like about the product, honestly. It&#x27;s a truthful product, easy to use and install, and comes with a counterpart for my razor. I&#x27;m a happy starfish! I rate this product: 5 out of 5 stars! And, I do plan on continuing to use this product in the future. I only hope that the take down process is as easy as the application process in case I&#x27;d like to move it around.&lt;br /&gt;For full review, visit: [...]</li>
    <li> This mirror works as described.  I have had NO problem with fog.  It is easy to hang and use.  Be sure there is ample lighting where it is hung.</li>
    <li> Easy to attach in shower; clean lines; doesn&#x27;t fog; much cheaper than the one we had and works better</li>
    <li> I have used various shower mirrors since I started shaving in the shower back in the late 80s or early 90s. This is by far the clearest that I can recall. Easy to use and set up, of course. I would recommend this for anyone who wants a better shave!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not fogless. It&#x27;s fogful. One week in and I was already contemplating trashing it.</li>
    <li> Amazing customer service! And the mirror really does stay fogless. Be careful how you clean it though, it can get scratched.  Thanks again.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly for my needs. I would buy more if my needs require it.</li>
    <li> I have owned a great many shower mirrors over the years. I must say that this is one of the best and least expensive ones I have ever purchased. It has a larger viewing area than any I have used before, and no blasted suction cups. The adhesive hook for the mirror and the razor hook both are hanging in quite nicely. Just follow the instructions, remove the protective film off of the front and the paper backing off of the back, hang it and go. You may need to briefly run it under shower temperature water (as the instructions tell you to) so that it is not colder than the water laden air around it, but that&#x27;s it. Try it. You will like it.</li>
    <li> Was great to start, but after a few showers, fogless doesn&#x27;t seem to work quite as well.  very easy to mount and use.</li>
    <li> So far the Cassani Fogless Mirror is working good, do not to hang it right under the shower head and its is very important when cleaning NOT to use cloth or towel only rinse your fogless mirror with clean, warm, running water and gently rubbing it with your fingers.</li>
    <li> A great product that really works in the shower. No more fog and always clear! Easy to install and use.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror, i bought this for my hisband which he uses for shaving his face but i like to pluck my eyebrows while im in the shower also. So its a win win for the both of us. Great product, really recommended.</li>
    <li> Easy installation.  Nice oval shape and size. After several failures with fogless products, this mirror may actually be the one that works for me! Right now looks like a winner.</li>
    <li> I keep having to wipe the mirror from all the fog while shaving. Just another ordinary mirror. Does not work.</li>
    <li> Replaced a larger, heavier shower mirror with &#x27;magnification&#x27; feature.  This mirror is super lightweight and so clear my husband said he doesn&#x27;t need or miss the magnification feature.  Read instructions regarding how to clean and preserve the fogless feature.  It&#x27;s only been a few weeks but it&#x27;s as good as advertised.</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I want. I can finally shave with a smile on my face</li>
    <li> This is a first-rate product.  It&#x27;s easy to install, takes up little space, and does just what it says--it doesn&#x27;t fog up and it gives a clear image for a shave.  It&#x27;s a terrific value.</li>
    <li> It is easy to install, light weight, and works great in the shower. It even has a hook to hang your razor.  If you need a mirror to shave in the shower this one is the one to get. It is great it is the highest rated mirror and has Modern - Anti-Fog Nanotechnology.    I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as stated...fog free for me.</li>
    <li> As advertised.  Was very easy to install and absolutely no fog.</li>
    <li> Worked as advertised for 3 weeks - now I can&#x27;t use it in the shower anymore</li>
    <li> The mirror design is nice, however it fogs up and I have to wash it off in order to use it multiple times during a shave.</li>
    <li> Only lasted one shower and now fogs up constantly.</li>
    <li> Not entirely as described.  Worked as described for my first shower only.  Thr mirror didn&#x27;t fog up once&lt;br /&gt;during my initial shave.  After that it seems to function no different than any other shower mirror.  Still&lt;br /&gt;functional though.</li>
    <li> This truly is perfect for what it does.  I can&#x27;t say I would have purchased it in the store because you wouldn&#x27;t think it would work;.  Easy to hang and can&#x27;t shatter and truly fogless</li>
    <li> The mirror arrived on time and undamaged.  Attaching the hanger in the shower was a cinch.  The mirror is truly fogless as I use it and on the few occasions that it became unclear, rinsing it under the shower was all that was needed.  It&#x27;s surprisingly light in terms of weight and works as advertised.  Would whole heartedly recommend to any one who enjoys shaving in the shower.</li>
    <li> This is a cheap product so you get what you pay for.  It worked good for a month then fogged up.</li>
    <li> Works Great. No issues.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for a few days, it seems to clearly be the leader of the pack! I have been shaving in the shower for years and I&#x27;ve had a bunch different mirrors to use. Unfortunately, most have had a very short life span and after limited use become almost impossible to remain &amp;#34;fog free.&amp;#34; The simplicity designed in this mirror to remain fog free and use is wonderful. I highly recommend the product. Use it; you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Been using the mirror for about a month now and it has not fogged yet.  Love the design.  Would recommend highly!</li>
    <li> Bought this mirror with a stainless hook after awakening to a crash at 2 AM.  Tired of my old mirror falling off the shower wall and fogging up every time I tried to use it.  This new mirror never fogs if I just run a little water over it to raise the temperature to that of the shower area.  couldn&#x27;t be happier to have a product that works.</li>
    <li> Excellent mirror. Does not fog at all. Easy to install, lightweight and very clear reflection. I&#x27;m so glad that I found this mirror.</li>
    <li> After our original fogless mirror fell off the wall and broke, we bought this one.  Love it so far!  It was easy to install and has been very stable.</li>
    <li> This is a great gift for your father, hubby or any male friend.  Check out my review on the Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was super excited about this review.  My husband had been using a square mirror with a large chunk of it missing and it would fall into our shower and stab my toes. So when I had the opportunity to review this mirror I jumped at the chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About Cassani:&lt;br /&gt;Cassani is a company that supplies home and lifestyle products that are efficient and modern. There products are new to the US but they have distributed products throughout  Europe and Asia.  Their products are innovative and practical everyday use products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Review:&lt;br /&gt;Cassani sent me their Fogless Shower Mirror and it included a razor hanger.  It was super easy to install and the stainless steal hooks stuck to my tile immediately.  I hung them at the back of my shower away from the shower stream.  The mirror comes off the wall easily for hand held use.  The razor hanger fits normal sized razors.  Needless to say my husband&#x27;s razor was a little on the fat side.  It did however fit, just not how it was meant too.  To keep it from fogging place both sides in the shower stream for a few seconds just before shaving.  It&#x27;s also shatter-proof  and is thick enough to withstand drops which is important because my kids use the same shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonuses to having your husband shave in the shower?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No shaving cream all over the sink.&lt;br /&gt;Less Razor burn because their face is warm.&lt;br /&gt;You get more time at the bathroom sink for getting yourself ready for the day.&lt;br /&gt;You can grab his mirror out of the shower for plucking your eyebrows up close instead of trying to see in the large mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00CNOUZE2 Fogless Shower Mirror - Guaranteed Fog Free - Exclusive to Amazon - No Suction Cups - Designed Not to Fall - Ultra-easy Set up - Includes Additional Razor Wall Mount]]</li>
    <li> Works exactly as described. Elegant design and by far the best fog free mirror I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> The mirror worked perfectly. No other mirror can compare with this one. The company was so helpful to be sure to give me instructions on how to  properly use the mirror too. Highly recommend this company and mirror.</li>
    <li> Why shave in the shower instead of outside?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several benefits -- the first is that the steam from the shower will actually make it easier for you to shave. The steam keeps your pores open and simultaneously softens your skin, which gives a nice, closer shave. You won&#x27;t have to be plagued by razor burn! Second, being in the shower keeps the razor free of hair and warm, which is especially great if you don&#x27;t use shaving cream (though I don&#x27;t know anyone who doesn&#x27;t!). The next benefit is the fact that, since you are in the shower already, you won&#x27;t be leaving behind a messy sink for your girlfriend/sister/daughter to have to clean up afterwards. I hate having to take a wash cloth and clean out the sink when I didn&#x27;t make the mess -- it is definitely a girl pet peeve! Any way you look at it, the Fogless Shower Mirror makes for a better and more enjoyable shave. I don&#x27;t think any guy could say no! It is also a permanent place to keep your razor, so you never have to worry about misplacing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend &amp;#34;installed&amp;#34; The Cassani Company Fogless Shower Mirror while I took pictures. He gives it a five-star rating. He says that it is nice to be able to stay in the warm shower (especially now that it is getting colder outside) to shave. He loves not having to get out and wait for the mirror in our bathroom to de-fog. We typically have to open the window in the bathroom to get some air flow in order to start the de-fogging process. He says that he has definitely noticed an improvement in how close his shaving is since using the Fogless Shower Mirror. He says that his skin feels softer and he tends to have less razor burn, but also that he just takes more time shaving since he gets to stay in the shower to do it! I think its a great idea, because I couldn&#x27;t imagine getting out of the shower to shave my legs. I tried once and I ended up with a ton of red bumps -- my skin really needs the constant hydration from the steam to stay soft. Myboyfriend really has no complaints with the Fogless Shower Mirror -- he says that the width is just about perfect, and that it really stays fogless as advertised. He likes having a place for his razor, and the fact that the adhesive is so strong. We both had our doubts with how well it would stick, but luckily, it has held up for about two or three weeks now with no problem. It is not too small for shaving, but it is also not too large so as to &amp;#34;junk&amp;#34; up the shower, if you are worried about that. We think that it would work well in any size shower.</li>
    <li> I searched around for a fogless mirror and after a bit of trial and error I settled on the Cassani.  It is a lightweight plastic mirror with a lens-type coating on one side, treated for fogless capability.  Installation is pretty much idiot-proof, just stick the hook to wall and hang it up.  Cassani recommends putting the mirror under the warm shower water to equalize the temperature between the mirror and surroundings.  I tried that, works fine, but the mirror seems to not need this step - does not fog up at this time, regardless.  Perhaps as the coating wears off, that recommended step will become more necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mirror does not have a magnification factor, simply hangs on the wall.  At this price, I think its a great deal and would highly recommend to anyone looking for a shower mirror.</li>
    <li> This is amazing! Love the mirror. Nanotechnology? Love it!</li>
    <li> This thing works!&lt;br /&gt;Incredibly easy to use -- just lift it off the hook and run it under the shower spray for a second. Voila, you are ready to shave.&lt;br /&gt;So much cheaper than the others too.</li>
    <li> I was worried about whether or not this would stay on the wall in the shower.  It&#x27;s mostly out of the way of the shower stream but gets splattered by water most of the time.  It&#x27;s still on the wall and doing well.  The mirror also is still very clear--sometimes you have to wipe it but then it&#x27;s all good.  Good buy and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Amazing, really.  I came back and ordered two more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really, really works.  (Just keep your maid away from it....  doesn&#x27;t seem to like being scrubbed.  It&#x27;s very easy to take off of hook and place in a drawer when our house cleaner comes.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe it works this well!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how they did it, but it is absolutely a fog less shower mirror.  I&#x27;ve had it for months now and it still does not fog up.  I used the enclosed attachment and it continues to hold up well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor hook is a nice touch too-works great.</li>
    <li> Best shower mirror I have used.</li>
    <li> Delivery was fast. Love the product.</li>
    <li> Works great.  I simply hold the mirror under the shower and it&#x27;s perfectly clear.</li>
    <li> Included in the box are 1 Shatter-proof Fogless Shower Mirror, 1 Stainless Steel Mirror Wall Mount, and 1 Shaving Razor Wall Mount, along with instructions and FAQs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: The mirror itself is very lightweight and it&#x27;s a good size. This product allows for reliable mounting along with the option to hang a razor and it has been easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I have not experienced any cons. I haven&#x27;t yet removed it from the shower wall, so I am not sure if any residue will remain upon doing so. I haven&#x27;t used this product long enough to assess long-term fogless-ness, but so far, I have no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
    <li> Best shower mirror I every had. Big and clear. Really like the stick on hook and razor holder. Just spray with water after shower and pat dry with towel. No suction cups that pull off all the time.</li>
    <li> Elegant simplicity!  You won&#x27;t regret getting this mirror!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first, even more when I received it, but...It works like a charm. I highly recommend it. I have been using it for a month.</li>
    <li> My son said Dad there is no such thing as a fogless mirror for the shower. I said try mine only had it a few days but it never fogs, easy install  however because of the stick up hanger it is not very portable but I love it</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love it!  Can actually see in the shower!</li>
    <li> Worked great at the beginning, but after time the effectiveness of staying fog-free goes away.</li>
    <li> Great mirror. Just as described. I hung it without a problem and it works as I expected.</li>
    <li> A very good purchase!  I understand why the hooks that come with this use glue (some shower stalls are not smooth enough for suction cups), but I wish suction was an option.  No matter; for less than a couple bucks I was able to find suction hooks that work quite well.  I have seen some fogging on the mirror, but simply running it under the shower head for a couple seconds to warm the mirror is all it takes to clear it and provide for an excellent shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product.</li>
    <li> When I first got this, it didn&#x27;t work at all and just fogged up immediately.  I figured it was basically useless until by accident, I sprayed it down with Clean Shower shower spray that I use after I shower.  Amazingly, after spraying it with the shower spray, it worked perfectly.  Now it works amazingly well and I just spray it down every day when I spray my shower.  Who would have thought?</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Very fast shipping. I did read some complaints though from some buyers, they claim it does start fogging up after a month or so.  Most have not stated that though and I purchased it anyway.  It&#x27;s been a week and it&#x27;s great.  Will edit if I do start seeing the same.  Must say though, the seller gets 5 stars for customer service as well as the product so far.  The metal holders for the mirror and razor either wasn&#x27;t shipped with product or fell out some how and the seller quickly responded and shipped it out VERY fast.</li>
    <li> It is not fog less forever. There would be lots of water spot that become a stain so you can not use it after 2 to 3 months if you use this while you are talking shower. I think it is made by acrylic but it is little bit expensive. I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> Pretty average mirror.  It lost its fogless capability after just a few weeks, and quickly deteriorated from there.  It was cheap, so I guess easily replaced.  I&#x27;m looking elsewhere, however.</li>
    <li> The mirror has performed as advertised. No surprises! It was easy to install and use.</li>
    <li> I have to say I was pretty impressed with this mirror. It really is fogless! It was great being able to take a shower and double check, to make sure I had all my face wash off  Before I stepped out the shower. And my husband said it was WAY easier to shave using cassani fogless mirror, then to have to take the hand held mirror in with him and keep wiping it off in order to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I am pretty impressed with this mirror. It really is fogless! It was great being able to take a shower and double check, to make sure I had all my face wash off  Before I stepped out the shower. And my husband said it was WAY easier to shave using Cassani fogless mirror, then to have to take the hand held mirror in with him and keep wiping it off in order to see. The Cassani mirror also comes with a cute matching little stainless steel hanger for your razor that way it doesn&#x27;t end up in anything and stays clean. Which makes your blade last longer!&lt;br /&gt;The  Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror is an easy quick hang and stays on tight. The mirror it&#x27;s self comes off of the hook it is on easily to be cleaned and I just wiped it down with my regular glass cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;If my other bathrooms weren&#x27;t claw foot tubs I would be buying this for each one. I plan on making Christmas baskets this year and this is one thing I will be putting in for the guys. I know that they are going to love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you would like to read more of this review please head to thevisserclan(dot)BlogSpot(dot)com</li>
    <li> Works great. No fog.  Lightweight and easy to hang.  Having low expectations going into this I have used it for a month. I will update this in a few months and see if this is still fog free. I expect and plan to buy this every year or 18 months.</li>
    <li> So I got this nifty little thing for the hubs. But I had to test it out first. HA!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fogless ehhh? Warm, hot showers are my thing! On most days, I use my facial brush to clean my face. I use to just close my eyes and perform my facial cleaning routine blindly, but with this new gadget, I was able to see what I was doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror itself is light. It has a protective film over the mirror where I had to peel off before using it. The backside looks cardboard-ish. There&#x27;s a &amp;#34;PLEASE REMOVE&amp;#34; sticker on it, but I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should just remove the sticker or if the cardboard like part peels off. I like the stainless steel hooks. It&#x27;s nice and sturdy.</li>
    <li> Horrible. This item has only one mission: NOT TO FOG. and does exactly that.  It fogs</li>
    <li> Shaving is a daily exercise but not one of my favorites.  So anything that might make this mundane task easier is worth checking out.  Cassani’s Fogless Mirror does what it says and works nicely.  The box includes two stainless steel adhesive wall mounts. You can attach the mirror and a razor on the wall mounts. If you are not completely satisfied, there is a “Hassle-Free 100% Money Back Guarantee if you are not fully satisfied.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to read the instructions closely on removing the protective strips on the front and the back of the mirror.  The front strip removed very easily but I did have a bit of trouble on removing the backing but with a little effort it was soon removed.  The adhesive strips were easy to remove and after waiting a few hours, my new mirror was hanging in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror allows you to shave and does not fog up at any time.  There are no extra steps to keep the mirror from fogging. So you can easy complete the task of shaving while seeing your face and neckline all at the same time.</li>
    <li> Great mirror works perfect.  Thank you for your prompt delivery</li>
    <li> Great mirror. No fog and I even accidentally dropped it in my shower and there was no damage.</li>
    <li> Follow the instructions and this mirror works great.  Clean the area for the mounting hook with rubbing alcohol, out line with pencil where the hook will go and stick it to the spot.  It will hold and can not be re-stuck.  The mirror itself is a very thick piece of plastic with a very clear mirror on one side.  Touch the mirror and it feels greasy.  This surface repels water.  Rinse it with water and it works fine, rub it  or use cleaner and it is ruined.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 21 yr old son bc he always takes his mirror into the shower to shave and of course its a mess so this would be perfect for him but as its not Christmas yet he hasn&#x27;t used it but when the pkg. arrived my husband saw it and wanted one so I gave him that one and ordered one more for my son,  my husband loves it.... and I&#x27;m sure my son will too....1-happy customer...</li>
    <li> I just needed a mirror for the tub/shower so I could shave and not get little hairs all over the sink. This product works well but does scratch very easily. My roommate got some soap on it and tried to wipe it with a regular bath towel. It scratched up so bad that it almost made it unusable. I contacted the supplier and they shipped me out a replacement with no charge. I cannot comment on the fogless feature considering I shave before I turn the shower on so this feature is something I have no use for. Due to how easy it is to scratch I would give the product 4 stars but since they didn&#x27;t give me a hassle and shipped a replacement for free I give them the star back for great customer service.</li>
    <li> Easy to install. Staying  very clear.</li>
    <li> AMAZING! even with all the positive reviews, i was skeptical, but i am very pleased. Great product. Saves me from the messy sink that my girlfriend dislikes and is a struggle to clean.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son so he can shave in the shower and he loves it. Mounts easy to the shower wall and stays put.</li>
    <li> True fogless.  Easy to clean and maintain.&lt;br /&gt;Great product at a very good price.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure about durability as I just got it</li>
    <li> The mirror is great but the razor hook fell off the wall after only a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Easy to hang. Cleaned shower wall well. Cleaned again with rubbing alcohol. After allowing wall to dry I hung up hook. Pressed hook onto wall for 60 sec. Waited 3 hours to hang mirror. No problems. Very happy with this mirror!</li>
    <li> Easy to install and no problems with fogging</li>
    <li> This mirror is fantastic! I have never even held it under the shower before using it, and it has so far never fogged. The mounting hooks are good quality metal hooks and look really nice. I&#x27;ve had it in my shower for a few weeks now and the adhesive is still holding strong. I highly recommend this mirror.</li>
    <li> So, it&#x27;s awesome, but it does tend to hold a ton of condensation and therefore it becomes a bit hard to see what you&#x27;re doing. It works though!</li>
    <li> Does what it says.  I like the razor holder it comes with.  I have not had it long but so far have not had to touch it to keep the image clear.  Company is very involved and it is important to them what their buyers think.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, until I read another reviewer mention how much attention this company pays to customer satisfaction. So I bought it, and was not disappointed. The company sent an email with the most thorough instructions you could write about a mirror. I never knew how much science was behind mounting and using a mirror. It is actually border-line comical, but very much appreciated. The packaging was also incredibly nice. Not to mention that it actually works as claimed. Best 10$ I&#x27;ve spent in a while.</li>
    <li> Excellent product --- as advertised!  Very easy to install; no water reservoir required; just a simple design that actually provides a fogless mirror experience ... imagine that!</li>
    <li> All good here. Works as expected.</li>
    <li> I run this under the shower water (both sides) every day before i shave to heat it up. It is mostly fog free for the rest of my shower. Now that I&#x27;ve used it for a while, It does have little spots of fog that never seem to completely go away but it&#x27;s not in my view while shaving and I&#x27;m not terribly picky about an inexpensive shower mirror. Overall I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Works great! Finally a fogless shower mirror that actually works.</li>
    <li> Yes YOU! Yes you, Fogless Shower Mirror! Where Have You Been?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes...I have been singing this to to myself when staring at myself in this mirror. Obsession? Maybe!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all: WOW! I am pretty impressed!  I do want to say that I have tried many mirrors that claim to be &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34;, and yes, they do start out by being fogless, but their main problem is that they don&#x27;t remain that way after a while, and I have to toss them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this one is different.  I loved the packaging.  The directions are very clear to use and they provide step-by-step directions on how to mount it on the wall, as well as how to take care of it.  I think that&#x27;s absolutely great because it eliminates all of my unanswered questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that this mirror is wider than other mirrors I have tried, which makes it easier to see my face and neckline.  I love washing and cleansing my face with it, and I noticed that this mirror does NOT fog at all.  The anti-fog nanotechnology that is infused in this mirror works wonders!. The wall adhesive is very powerful, so if you are going to mount it, make sure to choose a final place for it, because it will not move at all (thankfully!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this product and definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to a mirror that is finally fogless, easy to use, great wall adhesive, and saves a whole lot of time!</li>
    <li> Cassani was our first fogless shower mirror we&#x27;ve tried, and we are beyond thrilled. It is very light, easy to attach on the wall, has a nice razor wall mount, and is very affordable. Although my husband is shaving in the shower for a long time, never used a mirror, but did quite a good job shaving. Now, with the awesome dimensions of this mirror he is able to see every inch of his face and neck no matter how steamy the shower gets! I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I would not buy this mirror again.  Purchased in March and by end of April the mirror started would fog up immediately in shower.  Not much else to say, other than its good for a little less than a month so not worth the $$.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted! Works great! Love the way it holds my razor! I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> We don&#x27;t have a huge bathroom so when I get out of the shower I have to air it out before putting on my lotions, potions and makeup. And my husband always shaves before he showers. I was thinking he would save time if he did it IN the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure enough, it didnt fog up and hubby shaved in the shower for the first time... ever! I shower in the morning and I can totally see myself putting my make up on IN the shower! LOL</li>
    <li> Pro:  The mirror stays fogless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:  Don&#x27;t try to wipe off any moisture or excess shampoo with ANYTHING.  It will \\&quot;scratch\\&quot; the mirror producing lines that impair visibility to the point you wish you had not purchased this mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off let me say that this company has EXCELLENT customer service.  The founder regularly monitors the comments from his customers and will want to make every customer happy.  They sent me a replacement mirror and I am going out of my way to not scratch or get it smeared.  I have used the softest cloth I have, the one that came with my expensive glasses.  But the mirror still gets scratched.  This is probably an inherent quality in EVERY fogless mirror on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion to the company is to include a cloth that they think will work and charge more.&lt;br /&gt;Then every customer will be happy.</li>
    <li> I REALLY like this mirror! I have never had a fogless mirror for my shower before and I regret it. The mirrors that I have been using in the shower are always regular mirrors and when they get foggy, I just run them through the water and continue to use them. The problem with this is that the mirror would fog every few seconds and so I would continually be rinsing it in the water! After receiving this mirror, I have a new found love for fogless mirrors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my husband used to shave in the sink in the bathroom and leave his shave clippings all over the sink and counter. Well, even he has found that he loves the fogless shower mirror! He is able to shave in the shower and not make a mess all over the counter and sink. The mess washes right down the drain without any clean up and he states how much easier it is for him! (Another plus for me, one less mess that I have to clean up!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I can say that I changed/didn&#x27;t use is the hook to hang it and the razor hook. While I think they are both perfect additions to the mirror itself...I am renting my apartment and was unsure if I would be able to easily remove them when I moved out. (I don&#x27;t want to have to pay for a hook that I put up in the shower because I was unable to remove it.) So I did not use the razor hook or the mirror hanging hook. I did go to Wal-Mart and purchase a Command water resistant hook that was easily removable. The mirror hangs on this well and I know that I will be able to remove the hook without anything left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you frequently use a mirror in the shower or think that you may be interested in doing so....this is the mirror that I would recommend! I have had a GREAT experience with this mirror and it does NOT fog at all! I also have had no problems with water spots or anything of the sort!</li>
    <li> works perfect in shower does not fog up and did not cost as much as some did. Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> My 15 year old shower mirror bit the dust so I replaced it with this new fogless version. A few days after installing it I received an email from the seller providing tips on how &amp; where to install it in the shower. I responded by telling them it would have been better if that information was contained along with the product because I had already installed it is a less than perfect location. They immediately replied by agreeing with me and sending me out a replacement at no charge. This the first time in all my hundreds of purchases from Amazon that a seller followed up and then quickly remedied the situation so graciously. I was not expecting a replacement and would still have been happy with the product where I had it but will now be even happier. The mirror works as advertised and looks great and unobtrusive in the shower. Highly recommend both the product and the company.</li>
    <li> Surprised my husband with this mirror for the shower and he loved it at first sight.  I installed it, and just to be safe, put caulking around the outside edge of the stick-on hanger.  He&#x27;s been using it for about 2 weeks now and extremely happy with his surprise gift!</li>
    <li> Works well.  No fog.  Excellent undistorted reflection.  Well worth the cost.  The mirror also looks stylish and sleek.  I&#x27;d recommend to others.</li>
    <li> This fogless mirror by Cassani is pretty cool. It&#x27;s an oval shape, not too big, not too small. The adhesive on the back is incredibly strong. Speaking of which, it was extremely easy to install. It just sticks onto a clean surface. As an added bonus, it even comes with a hook for your razor as well. All pieces look modern and well-designed with a steel look. And most incredibly, it works! I take steam showers and the mirror was not affected by the steam at all. Crystal clear. Couldn&#x27;t stop staring at myself. Would definitely recommend purchase to others at this price. It even comes with a money back guarantee which is awesome if you&#x27;re in doubt.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t laugh, but I didn&#x27;t know there was a such thing as a fogless mirror. I always figured if I really needed to see in a steamy bathroom, I&#x27;d have to break out my blow dryer or crack open the door, neither of which is convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, there are fogless shower mirrors for shaving that are meant to stay clear. Designed for men, I&#x27;m assuming, to be able to shave in the shower, which is better for the skin (goodbye razor burn), you can totally stand in your super steamy shower and the mirror stays clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a guy and my husband doesn&#x27;t shave in the shower, but I actually find it better for plucking my eyebrows. The same rule kind of applies here - the pores are more open so hair is easier to remove. It&#x27;s less painful and I can get the really difficult itty bitty new growth much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror is an inexpensive, simple home product. It&#x27;s not high end, not fancy. It does what it&#x27;s designed to do and does it simply. I mounted my mirror to the glass wall of my shower because I figured it might be easier to remove if I had to take it down. We have a 10-year-old fiberglass shower and my experience with sticky stuff and fiberglass is that things stick REALLY well. So basically, my fear is that it&#x27;ll be permanent and perhaps less so on the glass. I cleaned the glass well before applying the stickered mirror hook and found everything installed quickly and easily. It took 30 seconds. Super fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very convenient mirror to have in the shower. It&#x27;s the right size for face shaving, for guys - or for eyebrow plucking for women, and it&#x27;s lightweight so I&#x27;m not worried about it falling off the shower wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I like this mirror. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I docked it by one star because it feels a bit cheap, which does leave me wondering how long it will last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2016 UPDATE: I really liked having this mirror in the shower. My husband also liked it because he could shave in the shower, which means less mess clogging the sink. Unfortunately, despite following the instructions and being incredibly careful to protect the film that keeps the mirror from fogging, it did start fogging in less than a year and was totally unusable shortly after that. I really did like it but it&#x27;s not a long-term solution.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  Mirror does not fog and is a good size.  The addition of a razor holder was a nice addition.  I have tried several suction razor holders, none worked.  This one works like a champ.</li>
    <li> It stays fog free for about 2 weeks...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I complained about the first one I bought and the company graceously sent me a replacement. However, it failed to stay fog free too after a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> Mirror mostly works. Obviously it can&#x27;t change the laws of physics, so when there are drops of water on it, it effects your ability to see, and I&#x27;ve missed a spot a few times while shaving. But mostly I&#x27;ve been loving it, and it doesn&#x27;t fog up.</li>
    <li> Better than Vadrow products! And for less money.Nothing fancy, but hubby can shave in the shower finally! Just splash on it if it steams up</li>
    <li> Very clear, nice size. Would buy again. It is as advertised.</li>
    <li> Finally!!  A fogless shower mirror that works.  I&#x27;ve tried many, many over the years and have never had one that worked. This one does.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect for showering, but the coating on it does wear off quickly.  Also, since I put this in my apartment, I didn&#x27;t want to use the more permanent double sided taping that comes with this, so I went out and got some suction cups for it and it holds up well.  I&#x27;ve dropped it a few times and had it be ok (it&#x27;s made of plastic overall).  Nice cheap mirror that you can use for multiple things and not have to worry about.</li>
    <li> Simple product, works as it should. But the customer service is out of this world! First time I purchased something and got a email on some simple reminder on care and installation. More companies should be proactive like this...outstanding!!!</li>
    <li> I recently tried this Fogless Shower Mirror from Cassani. I see that this product has many benefits. I installed the mirror. Super easy it took like 2 seconds. I really like that I can remove the mirror and take it with me if I travel. The hook will stay in place and you can just take the mirror off if you need to. I was a little skeptical of the fogless part. I typically take really hot showers and thought no way this will stay fogless during my entire shower. It did! Guess that anti-fog nanotechnology really does work.  I like to tweeze my eyebrows while I’m in the shower. It’s really the best place to tweeze your eyebrows because the heat opens up your pores making it less painful. My husband can save time by shaving his face in the shower instead of at the sink. Also, less mess doing it this way too. You also get a hook to hang your razor making it more convenient. I really like that it has a stainless steel look. It’s a really sleek looking mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this mirror is a good product for the price. If you are looking for a good shower mirror that stays fogless even during the hottest and longest shower I recommend this mirror.</li>
    <li> Really nice mirror.  It hangs on a hook so can be run under hot water in the shower to equalize its temp with the shower temp, but I haven&#x27;t needed to do it.  It just doesn&#x27;t fog up.  I had another mirror previously that would get foggy, so this mirror is great and was less expensive!</li>
    <li> Nice and light weight. But this product still fogs a bit. I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s anyway around it...</li>
    <li> Great product! I would like to see if they have a travel size mirror for my shaving kit.</li>
    <li> &amp;#60;a href&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;TOPcbe1da593e2e3c2c6ddc64db8a974666&amp;#34; rel&#x3D;&amp;#34;nofollow&amp;#34;&amp;#62;&amp;#60;img style&#x3D;&amp;#34;display: none&amp;#34; src&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/images/front/pixel.png&amp;#34; &amp;#62;&lt;/a&gt; [[ASIN:B00CNOUZE2 Fogless Shower Mirror - EASY INSTALL - SHATTER PROOF - Includes Razor Hook - Modern - Anti-Fog Nanotechnology - Exclusive To Amazon]] I know when I saw this I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out. When this mirror got to my house the first thing i done was turn my shower on hot and let the steam build. At first i thought yea right it wont work but to my surprise every mirror in the bathroom was fogged up except this one. Ive tried other products that claimed to be so easy to use but you have a bunch of other screws and bolts or just require somehting for you to have to go buy. This is not one of them everything is simple and easy to install. So i definitely recommend this to whoever is looking for a good shower mirror. &amp;#60;a href&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;BOTTOMcbe1da593e2e3c2c6ddc64db8a974666&amp;#34; rel&#x3D;&amp;#34;nofollow&amp;#34;&amp;#62;&amp;#60;img style&#x3D;&amp;#34;display: none&amp;#34; src&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/images/front/pixel.png&amp;#34; &amp;#62;&lt;/a&gt;</li>
    <li> had expected for my husband to be my guinea pig on this one and I would reap the benefits of not having to wipe out a hairy sink. But boy was I wrong ladies!I love this for washing my face/ using scrubs/exfoliating! I can make sure all my makeup is off. I enjoy exfoliating in the Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror too! It was so easy to mount</li>
    <li> Great product!  Does not fog AT ALL!!!!  Inexpensive and highly recommended!</li>
    <li> It is better than the other shower mirrors I have tried. It is not a true fogless mirror, more like fog resistant. When the shower is hot, it does tend to fog up. A quick splash of water and it clears up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased better at Bed Bath and Beyond</li>
    <li> Seriously???! Amazons reviews are becoming less and less reliable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been looking for a shower mirror for a while and being the good amazon shopper that I am, I found an inexpensive product with amazing reviews.  What a piece of garbage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is dollar store quality at best. It&#x27;s just slightly better than a shiny piece of cardboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit that I can see myself through it and it did stay fog free for 6 days. :(</li>
    <li> Great mirror - not much else you can say</li>
    <li> I have tried several others, they are ok but not fogless, the suction cups do no hold &amp; due to the fact they are held by  suction cups they stick out too far and you end up hitting the mirror and down it comes.  The Fogless far exceeds expectations, it does not fog, and is neat and trim.It is 6 stars out of 5. The follow up by the company is exceptional, unusual in this day &amp; age.  My recommendation is don&#x27;t bother looking at others, purchase this, you will not be disappointed</li>
    <li> Super easy to install.  Stays fog-free without having to do anything.  Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because you have to stick the mirror holder and razor holder to the wall.  I don&#x27;t know how easy it will be to take it off the wall.  I would have preferred to not glue something to my wall.</li>
    <li> I use this mirror every night to make sure i get off all my makeup before i go to bed and my dad uses this to shave when he showers and it is literally super easy to install and use. i love this product</li>
    <li> This is such a handy little mirror. First of all it is true to the statement it doesn&#x27;t fog. You don&#x27;t clean the mirror with any products you just rinse and wipe with your hand. It came with a hanger and what I loved the most is it wasn&#x27;t a suction cup. It has an adhesive backing. I have textured walls so I can never get suction cups to work on my shower walls. It also came with a bonus hook for your razor.Sometimes I will just get in the shower and wash off my makeup that way but most of the time I will leave the shower with raccoon eyes. With this mirror I can see if I got all the makeup off so I don&#x27;t have to wash my face a 2nd time. I did receive this item for my review. Would I buy this product, why yes I would! We love it!</li>
    <li> Does not look as nice as the ones from the major stores, it has no  frame. But it does do its job. And for this price, since nobody looks inside my shower, why not. Have it for a week now, and it does work.</li>
    <li> This is actually the first mirror I&#x27;ve used in the shower that doesn&#x27;t fog up!</li>
    <li> The mirror is smaller than I expected.  I should have read the dimensions more carefully.  The biggest problem is that it fogs up almost immediately.  I don&#x27;t see any benefit from the special coating.</li>
    <li> This was a good decision, shaving in the shower (and brushing teeth) is so much more convenient and easy. So far has not fogged...</li>
    <li> exactly as the title states</li>
    <li> This shower mirror is fabulous! It holds up during high heat and steam, and is definitely for more than just men who shave their face in the shower. Ladies - use it to get all up in your open pores and get those blackheads out! You can also use it for a visual while shaving picky regions. Fabulous choice!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son in San Diego and he says it works well. I made sure to tell him to not put cleaners on it and if it did fog to just splash water on it as some other reviewers mentioned. I used one of the new command bathroom hook things to hang it as it is on a newly remodeled tile shower and I wanted to make sure it came off easily when needed.</li>
    <li> It worked for just a few days. Now it is a foggy plastic</li>
    <li> I have used a shower mirror for years. This is the best yet. It is light and stays extremely clear. If it has splash marks on it merely take off hook and hold under shower. Time will tell it&#x27;s longevity but so far I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Also nice was I received instructions from the manufacturer via email when it shipped. They seem extremely interested in customer service which is extremely refreshing..  09/22/15 This is my second mirror. I purchased for our second bathroom as I occasionally use the guest bath when my wife and I have to get ready at the same time and I will take it with me when I travel. It is light enough to use a suction cup hook.</li>
    <li> I have always wanted a mirror in the shower but every time I have tried the mirror has fogged up and been useless.  In comes this Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror to the rescue. It has Anti-Fog Nanotechnology which repels fog. Now I&#x27;m not altogether sure how this nano technology works but I&#x27;m willing to give it a try. It is large enough to see your whole face and neck. I liked it because I could see where I was putting on my face wash, and if I was rinsing it all off. My husband liked it because he could multitask in the shower and shave as well. And I liked the fact that I didn&#x27;t see all those little hairs in the sink. It&#x27;s a win-win.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to care for you just rinse it off and dry with a soft cloth. It warns against using any kind of detergent cleaner on it because that could wash off the nano technology. I need to add that after using it for a while it has become streaky but still does not fog up.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror as a gift for my husband.  It was not what we envisioned but turned out to be the perfect shower mirror. My husband wishes he had purchased this mirror years ago. I would recommend this as a gift for any man that shaves. Also the seller is spectacular.  They sent us an email after the purchase to explain how to clean and use the mirror. Personnel service. Very rare.</li>
    <li> It never fogs very much and if it starts to fog just stick it under the shower head and rinse and its fine.</li>
    <li> I shave in the shower, and previously did it by feel.  It&#x27;s a big help to be able to see what I&#x27;m doing.  When I give blood, I prefer to do it through the Red Cross.</li>
    <li> works great simple and effective design</li>
    <li> I was a little unsure about this mirror, but based on other reviews decided to give it a try.  I am glad that I did.  It is very convenient to remove it from its hook, run it quickly under the shower, hang it back up and enjoy fog free shaving.  I also like that it is not glass so I don&#x27;t have to worry about breakage.  Shipping was very quick and it arrived in perfect shape.</li>
    <li> This mirror is awesome.  Easy to put up, fog free, and looks great.  Nice and simple.... and inexpensive!  Perfect.  I love it.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews, I wasn&#x27;t sure of the quality, but have spent more money on worse stuff!  IT IS AMAZING!  It came a week ago, and I promptly hung it mid-center in our 6 foot by 3 foot walk-in shower.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with fogging. The clarity of the image it still fantastic, even when there is water running down the mirror. Not sure what others are doing that theirs fogs up - but I have not had this problem at all. Would definitely recommend.  Even thinking about ordering another Fogless Shower Mirror for our guest shower.</li>
    <li> I was a little taken aback at how simple this was.  It&#x27;s pretty much a hook and a flat oval glass that hangs from it.  But it&#x27;s very clear and if you give it a splash of water stays fog free for as long as you need.  Only downside is that the back has a red logo on it that is noticeable if you hang it such that the back is visible.</li>
    <li> Great product so far. I&#x27;ve had it for about a month now.  Does everything it promised. Just run under the hot water for a few moments, and it will stay fog free for the duration of your shower. Works better than other fog free mirrors that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This is a good mirror. Works well, doesn&#x27;t fog up, stays clear. So far no issues. I didn&#x27;t like the adhesive hooks that came with it so I bought some 3M removable ones.</li>
    <li> Great Shaving mirror...even better then the old standard which was the &amp;#34;Showertex&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for my husband.  This fogless shower mirror is the perfect size and definitely works as directed.  The only  recommendation that I&#x27;d make to the manufacturer has nothing to do with the product itself.  The instructions to mount should be printed a little larger (they were quite tiny, on a small piece of paper and could have been easily overlooked) and they could be stated more clearly (i.e. Step 1, Step 2, Step 3, etc.).  That aside, I would highly recommend this product for anyone searching for a new shaving mirror!</li>
    <li> I have had many of these mirrors and although I&#x27;ve only had this one for about a month, it remains crystal clear. Best one I&#x27;ve had so far. We will see how it holds up in the winter when the steam is turned up! Update: I&#x27;ve had the mirror for around 9 months now and for the past 3 months it no longer is fog free. Just like every other one I&#x27;ve ever owned it fogs up instantly. You have to run it under hot water and then it will last for a few minutes while I shave. I don&#x27;t think they can ever truly make one fog free.</li>
    <li> This actually lives up to it&#x27;s reputation. It&#x27;s the only shower mirror I have found to actually be fog free. The only con was that there wasn&#x27;t any warning that you should never wipe this with a dry cloth of any type. I did this and messed up a portion of the mirror. It is coated with some sort of sticky substance that will come off if you use a cloth. After that, I only use a little mild bath soap and water and let it drip dry.</li>
    <li> &amp;lt;a href&#x3D;\\&quot;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;TOPaf1c0126de157835dfcf103e83bbe29a\\&quot; rel&#x3D;\\&quot;nofollow\\&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have put my Cassani Fogless Mirror to use! Okay, so let&#x27;s get down to the nitty-gritty. The mirror is light and made of a hard plastic material. When I unwrapped the mirror there was a brown paper sheet on the back and a white label on the front.  Each of these materials were to be removed.  Here&#x27;s the kicker and my ONLY complaint; there was no tag to pull of the backing from the mirror.  The paper was flush against the edge of the mirror and I spent over 20 minutes trying to get the front and back cover and front label off the mirror (it could have been just a fluke).  It was time consuming and frustrating.  As for the front label on the mirror, I just ran hot water over it to soften the label because peeling it off was not an option andI was scratching my mirror. After removing the label I patted the mirror with a towel and noticed a matte reflection due to the anti-fog infusion. I read the instructions and did not use any harsh detergents or cleaning products to remove the label. Just hot water. What I discovered was that the slick film I was feeling was the Anti-Fog Nanotechnology which is infused onto the reflective surface of the mirror. I placed the mirror opposite the shower head stream in my shower per the instructions. I showered and shaved using the Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror and it worked like a charm. Voila! If you prefer to get all you hygiene activity done in the shower, as I do, then you&#x27;ll appreciate this mirror!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &amp;lt;a href&#x3D;\\&quot;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;BOTTOMaf1c0126de157835dfcf103e83bbe29a\\&quot; rel&#x3D;\\&quot;nofollow\\&quot;&gt;Tomoson.com&amp;lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> Fogless as described. The adhesive was very strong. Mirror is nicer than expected for the price.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was possible.  Fogs from time to time but a little water clears it up for the rest of the shower.</li>
    <li> Excellent product works great good value</li>
    <li> Earlier this week I received the Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror from Tomoson to review. I have to say I am totally impressed with this mirror. I have tried many different shower mirrors and they never seemed to work well or at all, but this one seriously stays fog-free and it looks really nice in your shower. I was super bored last night so I figured I would put in up to the ultimate test. I turned the shower on as hot as it would go, shut the door, and walked away for 20 minutes. Came back to a fogless mirror. If you are going to spend money on a shower mirror, I highly recommend the Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror.</li>
    <li> A simple fog free mirror that works as advertised.  It&#x27;s a little too light weight but it does remain fog free, at least so far. It&#x27;s been about one month.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned other so called fogless mirrors that eventually fog up instantly.  Not this mirror. Its still working great and I love the fact I can just unhook it to use outside of the shower if needed.</li>
    <li> This is well worth the money. I shave in the shower and this mirror provides a fog-less very clear mirror. Even when it&#x27;s wet moisture doesn&#x27;t bubble up a distort. Easy to install, very thin and looks nice. I promise you, you won&#x27;t go wrong</li>
    <li> Easy to install. Easy to keep clean. Gives accurate reflection.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this 4 months now. It doesn&#x27;t fog immediately and I do take really hot showers, but it does tend to fog. It&#x27;s easy to take off of the hook, run water over it, and it is de-fogged. So for $14.99 I say that&#x27;s decent.</li>
    <li> My husband absolutely loves this mirror. It exactly as the description states and the company is sure to provide tips and tricks in keeping your mirror well maintained. I would definitely buy from this company again.</li>
    <li> I have gone through at least a half dozen different fogless mirror brands and this one is by far the best! The reflection is perfectly clear. I kind of hope bathroom mirrors can be made of the same material now..</li>
    <li> This si the second one I have ordered. Need two in my shower so I can face into and to side of shower head. Am I vain??</li>
    <li> Excellent mirror. Easy to hang and use. Easy to remove any fog if it builds. Have been using it with no problems. Highly recommend it</li>
    <li> When I am in a bind to get ready after my shower and my mirror is foggy, I pull out this mirror and don&#x27;t have to worry about fog! Only con is that is is not smudge proof. My 11 month old got her hands on it and it was covered in little finger prints.</li>
    <li> Smaller mirror than expected, but works well and doesn&#x27;t fog up.</li>
    <li> Mirror works well could be a bit larger, razor  holder needs a redesign. All in all worth the cost. Thanks</li>
    <li> I bought one for a gift and one for our master bath. This works beautifully.  I love the oval sleek design.&lt;br /&gt;More importantly, my tall husband loves it as well. Do not hesitate to buy one for yourselves.</li>
    <li> Ladies if you are looking for a perfect gift for your loved one look no more. The Cassani Company Fogless Shower Mirror delivers on its promise to give the man of the house or the man in your life a closer and better shaving experience. Men if you are always on the go and wish you were able to shave while you were in the shower this is the perfect solution for you. This shower mirror has a special nanotechnology that makes it not fog up while in the shower. My husband and I have the product currently placed in our shower and have had it there for the past 30 days. It has not once fogged up and it still remains securely placed. While the main use and purpose of this mirror is for shaving I used it to help me part my hair for deep conditioning and for facial scrubs. One of the plus sides to having this product is no mess to clean up. You can use this product when you travel and it is easy to clean and maintain.  One important factor to ensure that you enjoy this great product is to follow the placement guide they provide you as well as the cleaning guide. My husband was very pleased with the product and recommended it to others. I stand by my husband and I recommend this product as well.</li>
    <li> For men there are many benefits to shaving in the shower. Or so I&#x27;ve been told. I don&#x27;t know exactly what they are because I&#x27;m not a man, obviously. I do know that my husband shaves in the shower. Always has. And if for some reason he has to shave when he is not in the shower he absolutely hates it. What a baby...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, one of the things that sucks about shaving in the shower is the inevitable fogginess of whatever mirror he uses. And he has used a few. Cheap ones from the dollar store, an expensive one from Sharper Image, and everything in between. And without fail, they all fog up. This drives the hubby crazy. A shower mirror isn&#x27;t much good if you can&#x27;t see anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror. In my husband&#x27;s words \\&quot;Holy s*&amp;t. Where did you get this? Order two more! Finally a shower mirror that doesn&#x27;t fog up!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror hangs on a hook you stick to the shower wall (the hubby hates permanently affixing stuff like that so he used a suction cup hook instead) and then you just hold the mirror under the running water for a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;Bingo, no fog and a happy \\&quot;non-scruffy non-lumberjacky\\&quot; husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To see our FULL review please check us out at Griffin&#x27;s Honey  [...]</li>
    <li> This stays fog less for a few weeks, by then they hope you have written your good review which most of you have. I waited 3 weeks. So 1 star.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this item on 21 November 2013.  It was a rectangular mirror.  I liked it and gave it 5 stars (see full original review directly below).  Unfortunately the mirror got damaged (not the fault of the mirror), so I ordered another on 28 January 2014.  To my dismay the replacement mirror was oval shaped.  I returned it today 10 Feb 2014.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the oval shape is lame, in my opinion.  It feels claustrophobic to be staring at my face in a mirror that wraps to the approximate contours of my face.  Oval has nothing to do with the human field of vision and it is just a terrible idea, despite the vendor assuring me that their customers overwhelmingly prefer it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, you should be aware that any reviews prior to some date between November 21, 2013 and January 28, 2014 are for the previous rectangular mirror, not this oval one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is my opinion that to change the product as radically as this and still call it the same product, is fundamentally dishonest.  They are trafficking on reviews for a product that is no longer the product they sell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation is to avoid this business and buy one of the Shave Well mirrors:&lt;br /&gt;Shave Well Deluxe 6.8 x 5.2 $13&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0085WHBHU Deluxe Shave Well Fog-Free Shower Mirror - #1 Selling Shower Mirror on amazon.com - 33% Larger Than Our Original Shave Well Mirror]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave Well original 6.0 x 4.0 $10&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004VFXVJW The Shave Well Company a TRULY FOG FREE Shower Shave Mirror. Truly fogless by design. Will not fall off of the wall.]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is my belief that this mirror is actually a copy of the Shave Well mirror.  The original was rectangular and competed on size.  Now, they&#x27;ve changed shape without trumpeting that fact.  (As of today the product title is burdensomely long, but never mentions the changed shape:  \\&quot;Fogless Shower Mirror - Guaranteed Fog Free - Exclusive to Amazon - No Suction Cups - Designed Not to Fall - Ultra-easy Set up - Includes Additional Razor Wall Mount\\&quot;  [[ASIN:B00CNOUZE2 Fogless Shower Mirror - Guaranteed Fog Free - Exclusive to Amazon - No Suction Cups - Designed Not to Fall - Ultra-easy Set up - Includes Additional Razor Wall Mount]]  How about \\&quot;Oval Fogless Shower Mirror\\&quot; for an honest product title?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had my misgivings about buying from the copy-cat (see my original review below) and I&#x27;m sorry now that I didn&#x27;t trust my instincts.  I originally felt that the larger size was worth the compromise.  I&#x27;ll probably buy the Deluxe Shave Well as the replacement for this one.  I&#x27;ll be sorry it&#x27;s a little smaller, but c&#x27;est la vie.  At least it will be rectangular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you purchased the \\&quot;before\\&quot; rectangular mirror and then the \\&quot;after\\&quot; oval mirror you&#x27;d never know about this change.  Which makes it all the dirtier that they did it.  I tried not to update my review, but it seemed unfair for Cassani Company to have my 5-star rating for a different product than I reviewed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, Michael at Cassani Company, you may be all about communicating with your customers and kudos to you for that, but fundamentally changing the product without notice and trading on older reviews is immoral.  In my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review 20130103:&lt;br /&gt;Once there are more than a handful of reviews I&#x27;m loathe to leave another one.  Why am I leaving a review of this product ([[ASIN:B00CNOUZE2 Fogless Shower Mirror - Guaranteed Fog Free - Exclusive to Amazon - No Suction Cups - Designed Not to Fall - Ultra-easy Set up - Includes Additional Razor Wall Mount]] $15 today 20130103), anyway?  I noticed two emails coming from Cassani, the seller of this item.  The first email was a follow-up to the purchase, providing information in case the mirror had not arrived.  The second was a request for a review, saying that they are a small brand on Amazon and 5-star reviews can help a lot.  It is in fact an excellent mirror, worthy of 5 stars, so okay here&#x27;s a 5-star review.  And while I&#x27;m at it, I&#x27;ll try to satisfy other comparison shoppers like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been shaving in the shower for at least a couple of decades and never had a shower mirror before.  For some reason, last November I decided to look for one.  (Actually, now that I think of it, the reason was that I&#x27;ve been doing such a careless job of shaving lately that I thought a mirror might help me break my bad-shaving habit.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last time I paid any attention to fogless in-shower mirrors, the state of the art was mirrors that installed between the shower head and the water pipe in order to circulate hot water behind the mirror.  Apparently sometime during my Rip Van Winkle phase, somebody figured out that a light-weight mirror could be non-fogging by dint of its low mass which allows it to quickly adjust to shower temperatures.  That seemed like a good idea, didn&#x27;t require messing with the plumbing or lowering the showerhead and was inexpensive, so I went for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guessing from what I&#x27;ve read on Amazon, a company called Shave Well pioneered this product area, or at least pioneered marketing this product area on Amazon.  They offer two sizes of their mirror.  The original is rather small.  A larger one (the Deluxe model) is a bit bigger: [[ASIN:B0085WHBHU Deluxe Shave Well Fog-Free Shower Mirror - #1 Selling Shower Mirror on amazon.com - 33% Larger Than Our Original Shave Well Mirror]] and is cheaper than this one by a few dollars ($13 vs $16 at this time).  I bought the Cassani mirror because it is a bit bigger than the larger Shave Well mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cassani mirror is excellent and works as advertised.  After owning it, I&#x27;d say that even the Shave Well original mirror  [[ASIN:B004VFXVJW The Shave Well Company a TRULY FOG FREE Shower Shave Mirror. Truly fogless by design. Will not fall off of the wall.]] ($10 at this writing), though quite small, is definitely large enough to do the job.  But if I was going to buy another one, I&#x27;d buy this one again, because it&#x27;s a cheap luxury to get one a bit bigger and my shower is big enough to accomodate it without any space considerations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two sort-of criticisms about this product, neither of which cause it to lose stars:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I&#x27;m not fond of the glue-strip attachable hooks.  The hooks look nice, but I have a fiberglass shower enclosure and don&#x27;t use glue-on anything in there.  I&#x27;ve been hanging my razor from a suction-cup hook and I bought another one for a couple of bucks from Target.  It holds the mirror just fine.  It would be great if Cassani packaged this mirror with glue-on and suction cup hooks, or offered it packaged either way, but no doubt that would probably increase costs and complexity to make it relatively untenable.  (Note that the Shave Well mirrors also come with adhesive hooks.  This Cassani mirror also comes with a hook for your razor.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) I&#x27;m not necessarily a fan of buying a derivative product instead of the original (i.e. Shave Well) but in this case, the derivative product (Cassani) won because of the size.  Really, the up-and-coming competitor usually is priced below the original.  In this case that&#x27;s not so, but it is larger and thus seems to be a significant enough improvement that I preferred it over the original.  (BTW, I could be totally wrong about who came first in the marketplace, so take this info with several grains of salt.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the upshot - compare these mirrors on size and price and buy the one that meets your size and budget strategy:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cassini 7.5 x 5.7 $15&lt;br /&gt;Shave Well Deluxe 6.8 x 5.2 $13&lt;br /&gt;Shave Well original 6.0 x 4.0 $10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;N.B.:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While writing this review I went into the shower to check the mirror out and found&lt;br /&gt;that it has been damaged sometime between my morning shower and now.  Oops.  It&#x27;s not the mirror&#x27;s fault though.  I&#x27;ve had it for 6+ weeks and it has shown no visiblewear and tear.  But today, my housekeepers showed up and apparently decided they would use the shower-cleaning product on it, even though it was perfectly clean in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what they used, but it seems to have taken all the joy out of the nice clear surface.  I just spent 15 minutes trying to clean it with plain water, then with soap and then with toothpaste, with varying results each time.  It has not returned to normal.  I guess I&#x27;ll live with it for a bit and maybe make another attempt or two to fix it.  If those fail, I&#x27;ll buy another.  No point having the first one in there reminding me every morning of what a nice mirror it used to be.</li>
    <li> Great mirror while it stayed fogless. After a couple weeks it started fogging up instantly. Buying another one since the instructions say not to clean with chemicals, and someone may or may not have done that.</li>
    <li> Still fogs up... I just rinse it quickly and it&#x27;s back to no fog for a few minutes. Just not a completely fog free mirror like other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I expected but does the job so far. Hopefully it will last.</li>
    <li> Good item, can I have another hanging piece that sticks to the wall shipped to me separately? I need to move the mirror</li>
    <li> We have bought three of these.  My husband loves this mirror.  Somehow, it really doesn&#x27;t fog.  We&#x27;ve spent a lot more on mirrors that failed.  You won&#x27;t regret this purchase!</li>
    <li> This mirror is so lightweight! It also comes with a razor hook to hang your razor as well. It is so easy to hang anywhere in your bathroom and it doesn&#x27;t fog up!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I like to shave in the shower and have had many shaving mirrors. This product performs as advertised. If it fogs up, just lift it of the mounting hook and rinse it under the shower. It&#x27;s light and not stuck to the shower wall with suction cups. The mounting hook for your razor is an added bonus.</li>
    <li> Mirror works exactly as billed. Very clear and no problems with fog. This is after several weeks of use. Great.</li>
    <li> Works great ... I can see what I&#x27;m doing again with a razor in my hand! No complaints ... quick delivery!</li>
    <li> Works great.  sticks to the wall fine.  Hasnt fogged up yet. Its the right size.  No more mess at the sink.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband as his had become pretty gross looking over the years. The Fogless Shower Mirror works great, and as promised, doesn&#x27;t fog. I like the clean design and appreciate that I can remove it from the hook and use it too. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have been wanting to shave in the shower but was hesitant because, in the past, the ones I have used have been crap. I read the reviews so thought I would take a chance on this one. Really glad I did. It has a good size and was easy to install. The most important thing is that it WORKS! Not a spec of fog during the entire shower. Great purchase and thanks for making a great product!</li>
    <li> Good as advertised.  Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and helps me get ready easier and faster each day. It is great very sturdy on the wall in my shower helps me get ready faster as in the morning I can brush my teeth and make sure my face is clean in the morning. In the evening it helps as I can make sure all of my makeup is washed off thoroughly and clean as well as brushing my teeth again. Saves me some extra time each day in my busy life. The mirror is very clean clear and doesn&#x27;t fog up no matter how steamy the shower gets. Great product and would recommend it!</li>
    <li> Simple, does what it says. Great product</li>
    <li> I am completely amazed at this produce.  Never have I purchased a shower mirror of this quality at any price.  I don&#x27;t know how it does it but no fog, no water spots, no smudges, no rust and no distortion. Greatest I have ever seen. I recommend this to any one who needs a shower mirror.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST shower mirror i have found and or purchased.  No fogging, Holds no water for mold to grow.  Wipes off super easy after everyshower.  I can see this mirror lasting a very long time.  You can take it off the hanger and hold it in your hand to change your view and lighting for shaving.</li>
    <li> I got this mirror to shave in the shower and I think it&#x27;s great. It sticks on the shower wall just right; without moving around at all. The mirror itself is very clear once you let the steam get onto it, I just put it under the water for a couple seconds and it seems to start kicking in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d really recommend this to anyone looking for a shower mirror for any reason (that I can think of).</li>
    <li> Finally! A mirror that works!&lt;br /&gt;I love this mirror! I am not a guy, I am a lady. A lady with nearly waist length hair. A lady who shaves her underarms. A lady who likes to do spa facial masks and wash them off in the shower. A lady who likes to take off her makeup in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Before I had this mirror, I would bring some awful-yet-cheap mirror into the shower. I would pray that it would not break if it was a regular glass mirror, or I would pray that it would not fog up. Plastic mirrors are horrible, generally speaking. I do from time to time get contacted by companies and provide opinions about their product and they either gift me the product or give it to me very deeply discounted. I got this for free. Check out my reviews. I don&#x27;t always give a free product a high rating. If I like it, I like it, but if not, I am honest about it.&lt;br /&gt;Back to the review. When I got this mirror, I was really impressed with the packaging. Cassani did an excellent job. From the outer box, the mirror is secured within so that there is no movement. The back of the mirror has a light brown paper that is easily removed. The front has a clear film. Remove both of those, and you are ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;I chose not to use the adhesive hooks because I am going to be moving in the next couple of months. That did not stop me, however. There is a 3/4 inch hole at the top of the mirror. I ran a shoestring through that, knotted it and looped it over the shower head. Perfection. It is exactly the right height.&lt;br /&gt;Now about the mirror. This thing is incredible. NO, really, incredible. They need to re-label the packaging and add the phrase HD to it. Reflection quality is excellent. The image of the cheeky smiling guy on the box is not as clear as the reflection you will see in the mirror. It is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I chose to go into the shower for testing purposes with the following issues in place (Thank goodness for endless hot water!)&lt;br /&gt;I had an avacado oil and coffee mask on my hair. I had a matcha green tea mask on my face. I needed to shave. I had waterproof mascara on. Does this sound like the perfect storm to see if my mirror could handle it? Well, it sure was!&lt;br /&gt;When you do anything weird to your hair, you have to keep looking down to see if the water is running clear. That is great if you get to that point, but if you still have product in your hair, you don&#x27;t know what part of your hair is still affected! Crazy. With the mirror, I was able to see exactly where I needed to rinse better.&lt;br /&gt;The green tea mask. This will make you look like the incredible hulk. Little bits of the mask always seem to get into my hairline, and I discover them when I am drying my hair. Not awesome. Well, no more! Why? Because I was able to thoroughly rinse my face off. I was able to see those little bits of mask and apply more cleanser and scrub well.&lt;br /&gt;Waterproof mascara. I love and hate mascara. I love how pretty it makes my eyelashes. I love how it makes me feel pretty. I hate having to get this stuff off. It is a pain. You cleanse, then you look up. still mascara. You repeat. At the sink, this can be messy, with water everywhere. In the shower, it is a lot of guesswork. Not anymore. Saturate a cotton pad with your eye makeup remover, wipe each eye. Check it out in the mirror. Repeat as needed. Done.&lt;br /&gt;Shaving underarms. If you don&#x27;t shave your underarms, you are lucky. I, however, do. Armpits are at a location where humans can&#x27;t look at them for long without having eyestrain. Ha! That is no longer a problem! I was able to get this done, check it out and I was not worried about nicking myself.&lt;br /&gt;My shower mirror is really a welcome product addition. I know that when I color my hair next, I will be using it to get all of the color out. I know that when I come back from a costume party, I will not have to worry about cleaning all of the costume makeup out of the sink. Just like the ad copy says, this mirror is truly fogless. Trust me. I run a hot shower. When I come out, the mirror at the vanity is always fogged up. This mirror never even got &amp;#34;edge fog&amp;#34;, where the edges begin to get steamy. Nothing. Believe me, I was ready for it to happen, but it never did!&lt;br /&gt;The mirror is made of a lightweight material. The two hangers that are provided are brushed metal. For cleaning. I will be using a damp cloth and wiping it gently. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me, because I really like this mirror a lot!ower.

    <li> This is essential a regular mirror due to the fact that it fogs up.  You would be better off buying a handheld mirror and clearing the fog by running the water over the mirror.  This product does not work.</li>
    <li> I had a previous shower mirror that was hung up with a suction cup. Because it was heavier, it kept falling between showers. This lightweight mirror has had no such problems, and is a good size and works well.</li>
    <li> This was a very easy mirror to hang.  My husband uses it to shave in the shower and it stays fog free and works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Great product and superb service. Clean properly. Company explains several times- but tell family!! I Totally recommend.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Hanger for the mirror is permanent, didn&#x27;t realize that when I bought it. It&#x27;s my own fault for not reading the page closely enough.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it! It is a very clear reflection in the shower.</li>
    <li> Great product. Affordable. Easy, straightforward directions.</li>
    <li> It is a nice mirror with good magnification which I like. I like the extra razor hook. But it does fog up. The question is, are my showers hotter than a normal persons? Or is this suppose to work no matter what the temperature is? I&#x27;m satisfied just wiping it off with my hand periodically.&lt;br /&gt;  The company is a good company &amp; offered to send me another one which I&#x27;m not sure is necessary. If this is a lemon than yes. I have not gotten the new one yet. Until then we&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> This product is made of cardboard.  Don&#x27;t allow it to get wet as stated in the instructions.</li>
    <li> Failed after three weeks.  :(</li>
    <li> Awesome customer service. Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at just how big the mirror actually was! I used the mirror today to shave and there was absolutely no fogging. My only concern is how the hook sticks to the bathroom wall with an adhesive rather than a suction cup. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the adhesive is VERY strong I&#x27;m just thinking about how hard it will be to take off in the future! Overall, i&#x27;m very please!</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best shower mirror ever! It has not fogged up and it adheared to our textured shower tile with no problem.</li>
    <li> very nice-always easy to see for shaving.</li>
    <li> Absolutely works as advertised even in my steam shower. Shaving is so much more of a pleasure in the shower and not over a sink...a great product</li>
    <li> Why is it whenever there is a mirror in the shower you stare at yourself the whole time?  Is because this mirror is actually fogless and you can actually see yourself in it. As a woman I use this just as much as my hubby. He uses it to shave and I use it to wash my face. Great buy</li>
    <li> This mirror is adequately sized and simple.  My last fog free shower mirror, I think, was ruined by our cleaning lady who used windex to clean it too many times.  This mirror I can turn around on cleaning days to remind her not to clean it.  It easy enough to clean on my own.</li>
    <li> This mirror is great! I bought it about 6 months ago and it still stays fog less. Can&#x27;t go wrong for the price.</li>
    <li> It works!  It doesn&#x27;t fog.  The company is first-rate to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hung it up with removable waterproof 3M hanging tabs for easy removal, if need be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nifty little mirror.  Quite nice.</li>
    <li> I got this product for my fiance&#x27;. I am always the one left cleaning up the bathroom after he shaves at the sink. He absolutely loves this mirror. He can shave while showering which saves time. The steam from the shower opens up the pores and leaves him a cleaner, smoother, closer shave while it keeps the razor hot. And for someone who does not like the burning of aftershave lotion it really does eliminate razor burn. It really does stay fogless. He is in the shower over 30  minutes and it never fogs up it says fogless the whole time. I&#x27;m really impressed  with mirror  and we love it! I wish I would have known about it sooner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I got this product for free or discounted price,  I ensure that my thoughts, ideas and words are indeed my own.</li>
    <li> Owned many different supposedly fogless shower mirrors but this is the real thing. Easy to mount and no fog as promised. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and he really uses it! Great product.</li>
    <li> Was great for a week or two. Then the hook fell off the wall. No big deal. Cleaned adhesive and applied new. Back in business. Again everything was good until I decided to clean it. Thinking its a mirror and with not warning from the manufacture on how to clean it, I got the windex and went to town. I guess the windex reacts with the coating on it and turns it to putty because its nothing but scratch marks now. A swipe of the finger will scratch it. Its completely unusable. If you don&#x27;t clean it, its great. Sadly this information came to me too late.</li>
    <li> Amazing! No fog, clear view. Great for shaving.</li>
    <li> Very good....works as advertised!</li>
    <li> Fogless? Sometimes. This product DEFINITELY FOGGED UP which it isn&#x27;t supposed to do. However, to it&#x27;s credit, it cleared easier than most others by spraying it with water. However in a hot shower, it fogged up again moments later.  It&#x27;s very convenient for a hanging mirror, but it&#x27;s not as &amp;#34;Fogless&amp;#34; as it claims to be.  Update: 4 months later - Product completely fogs up and has become useless.</li>
    <li> I received the fogless mirror and was eager to try it out. I placed it on shower wall as suggested and I take really hot showers so I tested it to the max. The first few times the mirror was completely fog free. I was shocked. After a few showers though it fogged a little on the bottom of one side. Nothing to interfere with seeing in the mirror though. The real reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star rating is for the design. I would have rather seen it with a rim around the mirror.Maybe in different colors and I would have like to see the hardware to hang it less visible.</li>
    <li> My husband called it &amp;#34;workable&amp;#34;, but you have to keep splashing it with water as it does fog up.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;anti fog&amp;#34; coating is not very good. Started to fog up after the first month of use.</li>
    <li> I recently received Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror in exchange to give my HONEST review. Well, why a girly girl needs a shower mirror?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, at first I thought about the same thing, but then I realized that I really needed a shower mirror!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love facial treatments, specially during shower time but it was always a mess to either apply them properly or take them of. From face scrubs, facial masks or a simple at home facial, I find this mirror to be PERFECT. In addition to that, I do my own hair color and of course I take it off in the shower. That been said, it is super easy to take the color off making sure that I also take off color residue and clean very well my hair line. I can even bring my tweezers into shower!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly LOVE the idea of having a mirror in my shower! And on top of that, my husband is now able to shave in the shower, too?!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product quality, it is fogless, super easy to install and durable. In my opinion this mirror is very useful and a MUST HAVE in every shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m super excited about having this mirror and I totally recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only owned the mirror for less than a month, but it is still providing fogless operation as the first day.  Shaving is a breeze when you can take care of it in a steamy shower.</li>
    <li> rinse very clear and easy to mount.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a month now and 1) it has stayed up on my shower wall and 2) it really doesn&#x27;t fog up. It&#x27;s also nice and big. Perfect!</li>
    <li> I have had this mirror for about a month and it has remained completely fogless during my showers. It comes with a permanent mount, but I use an old suction cup which allows me to move it should the need arise.</li>
    <li> Mirror arrived quickly with two hooks...one to hang the mirror and one for a razor. The instructions were clear and it was easy to install. Loving this mirror so far.</li>
    <li> I am so thrilled with this mirror.  I like to use a mirror in the shower to pluck my eyebrows while my pores are open from the steam because it doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad.  This mirror was so easy to install and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it shattering.  You have to read the instructions that accompany the mirror to ensure your mirror works as it states.  I love this mirror and definitely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. It works so well in the shower. It does fog up occasionally, but a splash of water and it is good to go for the entire shower. It is simple to install too!</li>
    <li> Mirror worked great for the first day.  I have it mounted to the back of my shower, not in direct contact with any water.  After the first day it started fogging up just like any other mirror.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Works extremely well. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now. I&#x27;ve never had to splash water on the mirror to clear it which I find amazing. Great product and the seller makes himself available for questions and support.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband to shave in shower. Mostly because I like the design. We wish we had found it a long time ago. Before the 10 others that fell, rusted and scratched. It also looks better now that we have clear shower doors.</li>
    <li> This mirror works really great.  No fog build up. Can be easily cleaned by rinsing with water.  Great customer service.  Seller followed up several times after purchase to see if I was satisfied with the product and to answer any questions.</li>
    <li> Quick shipment , works well .</li>
    <li> I have tried several shower mirrors over the years and most of them will fog or rust within just a few months of installation. Many of them are also bulky and really stand out. This shower mirror is different. I&#x27;ve only had it one week but I really like it. It has a very clean and simple look on my shower wall. It&#x27;s not big and bulky and doesn&#x27;t have a bulky plastic frame like others I have had. And so far it works as advertised. It doesn&#x27;t fog. Also I had to pay for this mirror. No free deal like other reviews.</li>
    <li> The product is good. Cassani Company will bother you with e-mails with no unsubscribe link. You may want to look to other places for a better or the same product.</li>
    <li> love it.  clean,  simple design,  nice mount,  and a great deal at current price.  best shave mirror out of 3 or 4 others I&#x27;ve had over the years. highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful mirror! Not too big &amp; not too small. Just spray the mirror front &amp; back for about 10 seconds with warm water &amp; you&#x27;ll have a fogless mirror!! I (the wife) use it to get all that gunk out of my pores of my nose, &amp; getting up close, my breathing doesn&#x27;t impact the mirror which is why I love it. It&#x27;s always bright &amp; crisp. Perfect for getting off makeup &amp; also de-gunking your pores.</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  No fog after a few weeks.  Nice low profile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand why all guys don&#x27;t shave in the shower, it&#x27;s so much easier.</li>
    <li> as described. very nice addition to the shower</li>
    <li> Quick,easy installation and stays clear even through my steamy showers. Shaving in a hot shower is so much easier now!</li>
    <li> works great and was delivered quickly</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now. It continues to stand strong. Remains fogless, to clean just spray with shower head. Great product. Adhesive seems very permanent. I am curious to see how much work will be required to remove the hooks from my shower walls. Over all GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Started out great, But with no explanation the coating has come off in a streak and no matter what I do, that streak fogs up, It&#x27;s right down the middle of the mirror. If you&#x27;re lucky and get a good mirror, it is very large and easy to install and use. Right up until that streak appeared about 2 weeks into using it.</li>
    <li> Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror http://www.amazon.com/fogless-shower-mirror-guaranteed-ultra-easy/dp/b00cnouze2/ref&#x3D;sr_1_4?ie&#x3D;utf8&amp;qid&#x3D;1393191925&amp;sr&#x3D;8-4&amp;keywords&#x3D;fogless+shower+mirror#&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my Fogless Shower Mirror several days ago. My husband put it up very quickly. It was very easy to install on the shower wall. We decided to place it on the other end of the shower head. My husband was the first to use it. HE LOVED IT !!! For the first time he was able to shave in the shower. He said it saved him a lot of time by being able to shave in the shower !!!! He was very hesitant about it no fogging but said it really worked great. My son later that evening came home from work and took a shower. I told him to try shaving in the shower. He came out and said that is awesome !!! He also said there was no fog on the mirror. A great item for everyone !! I also am going to make it useful by tweezing my eyebrows :) . Useful for everyone in our family. Thank You !!!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Easy to  install.  No sprays to keep the fog away.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as advertised, awesome for the price.</li>
    <li> Awesome mirror, worth every penny</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say...I must have the only dud.  My mirror is constantly fogged and I certainly wouldn&#x27;t call it a fogless mirror.  I purchased it as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend...as he sometimes enjoys shaving in the shower.  I was so excited I gave it to him early and he hung it. sorry to say...it was fogged the entire time...I really want to return it but I will have to remove it from the wall and change everything around.  As far as I&#x27;m concerned I purchased a regular mirror ...which I already had and worked just as well as this one.  If I can convince him scrape it off the wall...I will send it back. PS we followed all instructions...to insure it fogless....notta  really unhappy customer...&amp;quot;A&amp;quot; MARCHESE</li>
    <li> This mirror functioned for about a month.  Afterwards, it would fog up in less than 5 minutes after entering the shower.</li>
    <li> This product is great. This not a piece of reflective metal, but an actual mirror that reflects clearly without distortion. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My husband loves his new fog less mirror and it stayed crystal clear while shaving in the shower.</li>
    <li> Very easy to install.  Totally fog free while showering/shaving!  Simple elegant design.</li>
    <li> This works, except every time I look in it there seems to be more wrinkles.  The extra razor hook in stainless was a nice bonus.</li>
    <li> This is cool exactly what I was looking for ! Works great .. Very happy and Thanks</li>
    <li> After third shower the mirror just fogs over and won&#x27;t stay clear. Cleaned per instructions to no avail. I am sending back.</li>
    <li> It remained &#x27;fogless&#x27; for about two weeks, but now it&#x27;s just like any other mirror.  NOTE: I followed the instructions about cleaning to the letter.  Was hoping for better.</li>
    <li> The main reason why it is still in my shower is the fact that I do need a mirror and I like not having to worry about shattering a regular mirror as this mirror is certainly not fogless! It worked for some time but now fogs every time I use a shower. You have to pour water over it to get it to un-fog, just like with a regular mirror. But, as I said, it is still better than having a real mirror in your shower!</li>
    <li> It stayed fogless for 2-3 days and then stopped working. I have to keep washing the mirror, at least 5-6 times during shower to shave. It is taking me longer than before to shave and I&#x27;m also wasting alot of water during shower. I&#x27;m not happy at all.</li>
    <li> Has worked wonders and has not steamed up at all. It also looks very appealing and has a bit of a modern feel to it. I would recommend this to other people.</li>
    <li> the sticker on the mirror was very difficult to remove.  I ended up scratching the mirror getting it off. It was a nightmare.</li>
    <li> I have been using this mirror the two months now and it works fine.  The glue pads still hold tight and strong, and the mirror does not fog up.</li>
    <li> The fog-proof stopped working within a few weeks. I traveled with it and after that, water beaded on the mirror and it gets fogged up now immediately. Even when I allow the shower water to heat it up, water droplets cover the surface so heavily that I can&#x27;t see anyway.</li>
    <li> Works much better than other products, even though the price difference is insignificant.  This mirror is truly fogless (due to the magic, fog-absorbing coating, I guess) and you need not remove it from the shower wall and warm it under the water for it to work.  It is a superior product, but don&#x27;t let anyone &#x27;clean&#x27; it with Windex, because that will ruin the fogless coating.</li>
    <li> The best fogless mirror I have found!  Truly everything it says is true. The clarity during a shower never changes ... will buy again if anything happens to this one!</li>
    <li> One star is too much.  It fogs up, gets a wet film on it. A piece of junk.  If it doesn&#x27;t cost too much I&#x27;ll try to get a refund.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaving mirror for the shower I have ever purchased. Its always clear and clean, with a simple wash with water. The mirror is crisp and clear. I highly recommend this mirror.</li>
    <li> The installation of this mirror was painless ; all I had to do was clean my shower wall, make sure the surface was dry, peel and stick the wall mounts, place them and then hang the mirror and put our razor in it&#x27;s new resting place. After installation I was ready to try this mirror out and see if it lived up to its claims. I got into the shower and turned my water up as hot as possible. I  waited until I got a nice steam going then peeled back my shower curtain and peeked at my other two bathroom mirrors, both of which were fogged up. The Cassani mirror however, was not. It remained crystal clear and I could see my reflection perfectly. I used it to make sure I got all of the makeup residue off of my face and to pop a couple of black heads. I don&#x27;t have a mustache or beard therefore I don&#x27;t shave my face so I invited my husband to try shaving in the mirror in the shower. He came out cleanly shaven and couldn&#x27;t believe that the mirror didn&#x27;t fog up! After everything is said and done this mirror does exactly what it claims to do, doesn&#x27;t fog up and makes shaving a pleasant experience!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had two other brands and this is by far my favorite.  It doesn&#x27;t fog and if it gets too much water on it (because I mounted mine too close to the shower stream) it rinses very easily.  I can&#x27;t imagine why this would ever have to be replaced.</li>
    <li> Out of the box it was fantastic; just hang it up and it works. Except one day (the heat was off, the mirror was cold and it got a bit too steamy) I had to run hot water over it to heat it up and since then every time I MUST run hot water over it or it will fog up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really want to give it 3.5 star, but ...</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about this mirror at first because it was such a great price. I thought it would be made of cheap plastic and was worried it wouldn&#x27;t last long. But, I was pleasantly surprised to find that while it&#x27;s very lightweight, it&#x27;s sleek and sturdy. I followed the directions and put it up the night before my fiancé would be using it. It&#x27;s been nearly two months and it has worked better than any other shower mirror we&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;m so glad he can shave in the shower again and not leave a mess in and around the sink!</li>
    <li> I hung this mirror eye level and during the first use  the thing got wet b/c the water was bouncing off my face and shoulders and spraying/splashing the mirror.  Unfortunately water turns the the anti fog coating into a bumpy mess of goo which makes for more distortions than a fun house mirror.  I guess this  *shower mirror* can&#x27;t get wet.  Kinda defeats the purpose of a shower mirror.  This thing is  a gimmick and probably should only be sold on late night infomercials.</li>
    <li> I recently had the chance to try the Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror thanks to the folks at Cassani. I got it through Amazon.com, and it was here a couple of days after ordering thanks to Amazon Prime. Using patented nanotechnology infused directly into the reflective surface of the mirror, it purports to let you focus on the shave and not the mirror. While at first that was the case, I&#x27;ll admit that by use 2 it was a gummy mess. The nanotechnology is actually a coating that when wet turns kind of, well...slimey. While the stainless steel hook looks pretty snazzy, and when left to air dry the mirror does too, at $15 I&#x27;m not too sure I&#x27;d buy it. Especially when you consider it&#x27;s not glass, it&#x27;s plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therein lies the second problem. I&#x27;m certain it was just the one shipped to us, but the one we received was slightly &amp;#34;warped&amp;#34;, leaving it not optically correct and closer to a fun house mirror. Which hubby pronounced to be quite distracting during his shave. So while the upside is that a glass mirror would most certainly have been shattered, the downside is, plastic bends instead of breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, fogless? Check! Shatterproof? Check! It is large, mostly clear, and comes with mountable brushed steel hooks for the mirror and your razor. And hubby has decided shaving in the shower is better, cleaner and quicker than shaving in the sink. The downside is it gets wet in the shower, turns gummy, and is kind of expensive for a piece of oval plastic. I&#x27;ll let you decide if the convenience is worth the potential drawbacks.  I do like that the company stands by their products and offer a 100% Money Back Guarantee.  You just don&#x27;t get that from companies anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the above product(s) free of charge from Cassani.  I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.  My review is based on my experience with the product and/or brand, which may differ from yours.</li>
    <li> Best shower mirror yet.</li>
    <li> I have had this in my shower for over a month and it is still fog free!! Perfect size for a shower and it is not big and bulky!! I love it!!</li>
    <li> I’ve been using various “fogless” mirrors for years to shave in the shower. They worked fine in the beginning, but they all failed within a year or two. I resigned to the fact that I would have to replace the shower mirror every few years. Since I needed a new one, I thought I would research my options. After much research, weighing positives and negatives, I went with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was perfect (no fog or condensation) right after I bought it (summer), but condensation now appears with every shower (fall). I’m chalking this up to the temperature changes—cold mirror now gets hit with hot, humid air. With my already warm, wet hand, (i.e., pliable, smooth skin) I lightly wipe off the condensation as soon as it appears, and the mirror is clear for the rest of my shower (about 20 minutes). No fog while shaving, which is why I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy install, nice dimensions for shower (I hate unneeded extra space--i.e., square shape), and good customer service; the company emailed me a few times after the purchase to make sure everything was fine. The company seems very concerned about getting this correct. So refreshing!</li>
    <li> Mirror does not fog as described.  Nothing is wrong with the mirror.  Works very well.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> It was a bit on the bare bone minimum on the design side of things.Showing the box it comes in doesn&#x27;t give a clear idea what your purchasing. I had to go strictly by reviews.</li>
    <li> Works pretty good.  Does not fog up in the shower which is great.  Make sure when placing the mirror that the lighting is good for your reflection.</li>
    <li> My husband loved using the Casanni Fogless Shower Mirror and thinks it&#x27;s neat shaving while he&#x27;s showering. He feels like it&#x27;s easier than shaving by the bathroom sink. Also he doesn&#x27;t have to wipe the steam off the bathroom mirror like he usually did before shaving. His face feels smoother and his shave is closer and cleaner. An added plus he liked was the razor wall mount so he has a place to put his razor!</li>
    <li> Crystal clear shaving makes for a happy guy (and less nicks)!</li>
    <li> Tried to find the perfect mirror for my husband you takes a longer bath than I do. !!!! He shaves in the bath and needs a better mirror than my hand one  .  This is GREAT.  !!! Love the bracket that holds the mirror and the extra one that holds the shaver. !!!! Great product. ! ! Great price. !!! Received really fast and in prime condition. !!!! Thank you very much. :-)</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  The mirror is awful and FOGS IMMEDIATELY.  It&#x27;s terrible.  Plus the razor holder can handle small razors, but anything larger, the Machs for instance, don&#x27;t really fit the holder so they fall out regularly.  It&#x27;s a rip off.  Beware.</li>
    <li> Gave this mirror to my husband and my son for Christmas. They love it and it really does work! No fog!</li>
    <li> Been using it for about a month. So far, it works as advertised. The mirror remains fog free. The challenge I ran into was water splattered from my head would make it difficult to see my face clearly. This is easily solved by just holding the mirror under the shower and wetting the surface thoroughly. Then the image is very clear for my shaving needs.</li>
    <li> exactly as advertised, with excellent follow-up</li>
    <li> Love this shower mirror because now I don&#x27;t have my clean up my better half&#x27;s shaving mess in the sink anymore! Work perfect and he likes it too.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband for Christmas. Not sure what went wrong, but it fogged up on the first go. It has never worked.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very fragile. I wiped it off with a very soft towel and it left scratches on it. I won&#x27;t touch it again. We have very hard water so I can&#x27;t imagine it&#x27;s going to last very long. We shall see.</li>
    <li> Fogged up upon first use! Don&#x27;t waste your money, go with the more expensive one. I wish I could return.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this mirror</li>
    <li> This item is crap.  It fogs up the first minute you start the shower and stays that way no matter what you do. If I had to I would not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Great Fogless mirror! Just wish it looked less cheap. It did exactly what it said it would, and I love that it also comes with a great razor holder! Quick tip for new buyers: do not place the mirror in direct stream of water. Other than that it worked perfectly and I was impressed! I use this mainly for washing my face and brushing my hair in the shower. Or shaving hard to see places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item was sent free for consideration. I am not compensated for this review, and all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> excellent mirror and wall holding accessories.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. Make sure to put it in a place where it won&#x27;t get splashed. Opposite side of shower head is good.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. I followed instructions to the letter, but mirror fogged within 3 months!  Unusable in the shower to shave now.  Why do these companies lie?  i need my money back, as i was misled by the product information.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Fogless shower mirror&amp;#34;....too bad it fogs up all the time and i have to run it under the water to get rid of the fog for 30 seconds till it comes back.</li>
    <li> Have only used once but so far my husband really likes it.</li>
    <li> On the whole I really like this mirror.  It is optically better than the stainless steel ones I have tried, and I wouldn&#x27;t consider hanging glass in the shower so this seems a viable compromise.  It was completely fogless for the first couple of weeks, but now it is pretty fogged over by the time I&#x27;m ready to shave.  I just run it under the water for a second and it stays clear for the duration of my shave and shower, so it&#x27;s not a big issue as long as it doesn&#x27;t get any worse.  For the record, I have not washed or cleaned it with anything besides a quick rinse under the running water of the shower head.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this.  The other one we had kept losing it&#x27;s suction and falling down.  It also fogged up. So far this one is proving to be everything they said it would be, and is less conspicuous than the other one.  A good design, worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> For the price the mirror is fine but only stayed &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; for about 2 weeks.  I still use it (about a year now) but have to apply a soapy water mixture to it to get it to stay fogless for the 10 minutes it takes me to shave my face and head.</li>
    <li> Great mirror.  Seller was quick, professional and even e-mailed tips on properly installing and caring for the mirror after it was purchased.  Happy with the purchase and even happier with the high level of customer service!!</li>
    <li> Very large and clear. Excellent value for the money</li>
    <li> This is a great product and my husband loves it. I am so glad I bought it for him.</li>
    <li> This mirror works great!  I have my face and head. This is so nice to be able to see while I shave.  This mirror does not fog up at all.</li>
    <li> Great product, shipped quickly!</li>
    <li> This mirror is fantastic.  I considered spending a lot more on another shower mirror but I&#x27;m glad I found this and tried it first.  It&#x27;s made of plastic so there is no worries if you drop it.  It stays fog free and is just what I was looking for.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better shower mirror for the price.</li>
    <li> We just remodeled our bathroom, and with a full glass shower enclosure, we&#x27;re looking for a mirror that could be hung in the shower to use for shaving.  This mirror is perfect.  When they indicate it is footless, they are not exaturating.  This mirror stays perfectly fog-free, with no distortion.  It is very light weight, and large enough to see yourself clearly while shaving.</li>
    <li> Not sure what happened but it without any harsh cleaning it turned scratched and opaque...had to throw it away.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work AT ALL! Fogs up in 2 seconds. Don&#x27;t waste ur money!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good and easy to install, but it still gets pretty foggy.  Perhaps my showers are too hot.</li>
    <li> Garbage. Fogs up just like any other mirror. MAYBE you get an extra 10 seconds versus a standard mirror. I don&#x27;t like having to play beat-the-clock when i have a razor to my face. Purchased because of good reviews- starting to think Amazon allows fake reviews.</li>
    <li> So far mirror has been great. I was using a smaller mirror before I purchased this one, about half the size. I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference in clarity from my old one, and zero fogging. Hanger for the mirror and a second one for a razor was included in the package, both are very good quality. Very pleased with purchase.</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  So far so good.  Very clean look.</li>
    <li> The fogless shower mirror by Cassani is a detachable mirror with a razor holder that you hang in your shower for general shaving use. Chris had been wanting to buy one for a long time. When I got the chance to review it I was thrilled. I was a bit worried about how it would hold up in our old shower. Well, it&#x27;s been great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been in our shower for about a month and a half now. During that whole time the mirror and razor holder haven&#x27;t fallen or fogged up even once. Our razor is pretty heavy so that&#x27;s saying a lot! The fogless shower mirror exceeded my expectations and I am so pleased to have this in the shower now. It&#x27;s really helped to cut down on messes around the sink from a certain someone&#x27;s shaving. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It has a high rate of customer satisfaction and includes a 100% money-back guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a stainless steel razor hook. This will help prolong your razors lifespan by keeping it from sitting on a wet shower ledge.&lt;br /&gt;The mirror itself is made with anti-fog nanotechnology. It really works too!&lt;br /&gt;You can see you entire face in it. You don&#x27;t need to worry about missing spots or turning at weird angles to see.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s detachable. It&#x27;s great for home or travel.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also deceptively light. This thing does not weigh much at all so it really stays up well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked this so much and at $15 it&#x27;s well worth the money. I honestly don&#x27;t have a single con to list- which is a first for me. After over a month of use this has held up with no issues or signs of wear whatsoever. It&#x27;s a great product. I&#x27;m giving the Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror 5/5 stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the products mentioned above for review purposes. All opinions written are 100% honest and own.</li>
    <li> This shower mirror exceeded expectations. Nice mount, arrived quickly, quality product.</li>
    <li> Does what it was designed to do very well.  And beautiful!</li>
    <li> From my experience this mirror is no different than any ordinary mirror. It fogs up early and often while in the shower. I have followed the instructions and only used warm water and my hand to clean it but it still gets foggy right away. If you don&#x27;t mind constantly splashing water on it while using it than it works as a shaving mirror in the shower.</li>
    <li> It was my first time trying it out also for my family. Never heard of it before until I got the opportunity. The shipping was fast, the product was all intact. It was easy to install but it was a small issue of it being fogless. My husband likes to shave in the shower the first week we got it. After a while it starts being blurred but other than that it was a great product.</li>
    <li> Just does not work well as a mirror. Not when the shower is on at least. Yes I followed the directions.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months and for the first couple of months it was awesome. But over time it has slowly started to fog more and more.</li>
    <li> The Fogless Shower Mirror From CASSANI is AMAZING! I loved it!It is the perfect size! Not too bulky and not to small! easily fits anywhere in your bathroom and doesnt look out of place!as soon as i took it out the box i breathed on it...i know silly me...i just wanted to test it out hehe.there was no fog from my breath what so ever on the mirror! we loved it! it also saves time in the shower!My husband can get straight into the shower and handle his business without having to shave at the sink than go into the shower now it is a one step process! It helps me out a lot too! I hate it when i have make up on and i think i took it all of my face during my shower but i go downstairs, look at a mirror and i look like i have racoon eyes!Ha!Now i can make sure I took every last drop of make up while im in the shower.This mirror is truly a time saver!the quality of the mirror is excellent too! It doesnt look like a cheap mirror! you get a great picture i could almost say HD. Picture does not look wavy at all!And lastly it is super easy to clean!Just follow the rules and you will be fine!i just rinse it with luke warm water and with the tip of my fingers I lightly rub it..GOOD TO GO!You will love this product!i did!</li>
    <li> This never worked.  Period.  I have to constantly splash water on the mirror to remove the fog and then it fogs right back up.</li>
    <li> Since I received this &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirror and installed it by following the installation instructions that came in the box, the mirror has been completely fogged except for 2 small spots on the edge of the mirror.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Instructions a bit overwhelming but once it&#x27;s up, it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
    <li> The mirror is nice with a bright, clear quality. This item was well-packaged &amp; shipped quickly. (My only tiny minus is that the peel-off backing on the mirror and the hook was tedious to remove, but eventually I got it. Maybe adding a small pull-tab of some type would be an easy fix.)</li>
    <li> Very clean-sharp looking! Adds quality to the shower time!</li>
    <li> Stopped to work after a few weeks... Never cleaned with products... It only stays inside my bathroom... After a few weeks the fogless mirror, was all fogfull mirror!!!</li>
    <li> so far, the best of these I&#x27;ve tried</li>
    <li> still gets slightly foggy</li>
    <li> After owning this product for a month I am heavily disappointed. Upon turning on the shower it fogs. I rinse it with water and in under 60 seconds it fogs again. Did I receive a defective product? I have followed the instructions carefully and the only thing that has touched this mirror is the water coming from the shower head. I will be returning it.</li>
    <li> Like it so much that I purchased extras for the other showers. Works as stated in the other reviews so there&#x27;s not too much to add here.</li>
    <li> i have been purchasing &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; shower mirrors for years.  this the first one that actually works.  thank you.  great product</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says it will. Easy to install and clean.</li>
    <li> Great for when I wash my face with my Clarisonic in the shower. I can see exactly where I&#x27;m washing my face and not waste any of my product.  I have it on the side of my shower so it doesnt get wet with the stream. I do have to wipe the initial fog off the mirror then its fine for the rest of the time. Prompt shipping and contact with the company!</li>
    <li> Fog free, yes.  But when you buy a fog free mirror, you also expect it to be clear.  I have had to run water over this mirror to make it fog free since day 2. After running water over it, it is only usable for about 30 seconds, after that, the water beads up all over it, and you can hardly use it.</li>
    <li> So far,the product is great, fogless (a little soap will do the job) and the mirror is light weight so stick to the bathroom surface really good. I enjoy looking at it every morning!</li>
    <li> Great product, does what it says it will, super convenient!  highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review. I was not required or compelled to write a positive review. The opinions I&lt;br /&gt;have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with FTC 16 CFR, Part 255.</li>
    <li> It does do a great job of staying fog less! Cool, handy product!</li>
    <li> Sometimes you opt to use a product the way that it works for you and not necessarily what it was intended to do.  I really needed a mirror in my bathroom that #1 was lightweight,  #2 did not fog up post-shower or bath and #3 UNBREAKABLE.  Since I am a renter, I opt to not use options that would damage the walls.  I knew I wanted this mirror for use outside of the shower and decided to install a clear Command hook near my sink since I do my make up in that area.  The stainless steel hooks are nicer, but this works for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a handheld mirror that I use while applying mascara, eye liner, lip liner, anything that requires a mirror up close to my face, but that mirror is glass and I have dropped it a few times and I&#x27;m scared that it will break.  If there are guys out there that like to shave in the shower, this would definitely be a good option since you have the hooks to hang the mirror up and also a razor.  I have seen other fogless shower mirror options that are a few dollars cheaper, but this one has the nicest set up for this price point.</li>
    <li> My old fog less mirror finally was on the way out.  It was the old kind that you fill with hot water that slowly drains out.  This one is much better.  Nothing to do to activate it, just hang it and go.  I tried breathing on it directly to fog it up and it still stayed clear.  Fits your full face and is light weight.  Very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased too many so-called &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; shower mirrors I care to remember over the years. They usually break down after a few months and start to have permanent water marks. This product is elegantly and smartly designed. Crystal clear view; water just beads off (after a quick rinse under the shower head). It&#x27;s insanely but beautifully simple in design. Very happy with this purchase. Money well spent. Very reasonably priced. GREAT product. Company obviously cares about putting out a quality product.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror. It will not fog up and my husband uses it to shave with while taking a bath.The seller was wonderful to work with and shipped it out very quickly. I highly recommend this mirror to anyone looking to purchase one for themselves or as a gift.</li>
    <li> Fogless Shower Mirror Review!&lt;br /&gt;I recently received The Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror to review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It included...&lt;br /&gt;1 Stainless Steel Mirror Wall Mount&lt;br /&gt;1 Stainless Steel Shaving Razor Wall Mount&lt;br /&gt;1 Shatter-Proof Fogless Shower Mirror&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the description it says that to use the mirror you simply place the stainless steel wall mounts where they are most convenient in your shower, affix your shower mirror and personal razor. And you are ready to shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror has Anti-Fog Nanotechnology which repels fog and allows you to focus on getting a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros...&lt;br /&gt;It is kind of nice having a mirror in the shower. I have used it every time I have taken a shower.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the included razor wall mount the most. I like having a place to put my razor instead of it lying on the shelf.&lt;br /&gt;The mirror does work and I see no fog on the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons...&lt;br /&gt;I am not really sure I needed a mirror in the shower, but I do use it.&lt;br /&gt;The fogless technology is sticky and seems to gel up, so you have to rinse it off every time you are in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product if you are in need of a mirror in the shower. It is nice to have and the razor wall mount is my favorite part of the product, although I guess I could have just bought that separate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> Works as intended and so far it has stayed put on the wall. Keeps my boyfriend from making a mess on the bathroom sink :)</li>
    <li> A huge step up from the drug store mirror I had been using. Better looking. Better working. An actual&lt;br /&gt;aesthetic enhancement to my favorite room in the house-my shower!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly.  Great price.  Glad i made the purchase.  Will by from them again.</li>
    <li> This is the best fog less mirror on the market. Even though you can hang it up, its ergonomic design allows you to actually hold the mirror with your thumb through the hole in order to obtain the proper angles while shaving. It will not fog up at all. Take heed to the instructions when cleaning it as the coating is susceptible to marring if abrasives or chemicals are utilized. Just water and a good microfiber cloth is all you need. I highly recommend this mirror for anyone who likes to shower shave, thanks!</li>
    <li> This is a cheap mirror that fogs up the same as any other mirror.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this!</li>
    <li> After reading reviews of this product I was somewhat discouraged by some of the negative comments but ultimately was swayed by the positive notes from several purchasers.  When the mirror arrived I followed the simple directions for mounting it and was extremely pleased with the fogless results I obtained thereafter.  However, after a week had passed it began to fog up.  Getting rid of the fog was easy enough--simply spray water on the mirror.  It&#x27;s not as advertised, but I could live with it.  What worries me is that the backing for the mirror appears to be cardboard, and every time I spray the front of the mirror with warm water I&#x27;m getting some of the water dripping down the wall and onto the back of the device which I suspect will eventually wear off the cardboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I forsee a short life for this product and imagine going back on the prowl for a more workable mirror.</li>
    <li> It does what it says it does. Hard to ask for more than that.</li>
    <li> Just so you know this is a BIG shave mirror.  Even someone with bad eyes like me can see my ugly mug with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that the mounting hook is a permanent, stick on type.  Make sure you follow the instructions on installation.  I would have preferred a suction cup type as I use my shaving mirror during travel and would like to mount it to the shower in the hotel.  In this case I am SOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, although they say this is fog free, that is not totally true. I would say this is really fog resistant but only for a few minutes.  You need to preheat/wet the mirror in order to get a few minutes of fog free usage.  Just remember to NEVER clean the mirror with any type of cleaning solution or you might lose what little fog resistance there is.  I think in time I might try treating it with Rain-X that you use to keep car windows rain and fog free.  We&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise not a bad mirror, I am dinging 1/2 star for not really being fog free, and 1/2 star for the mounting bracket being stick on.</li>
    <li> I had a great experience with this company and the product is perfect</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. It worked the 1st day I put it in the shower.. and then every following day it fogged up.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t fog the first time...........but it has fogged up every time I have used it since.</li>
    <li> So it did&#x27;nt fog for about 2 showers AND now it&#x27;s just like ALL the others! All the people that are raving about this PLEASE tell me is there some special treatment to keep this AMAZING mirror from fogging...</li>
    <li> This mirror stayed &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; for an handful of showers (probably around 7), now it fogs up every few minutes after it gets rinsed off. I have never &amp;#34;cleaned&amp;#34; this mirror, all it has done is sat on it&#x27;s hook for the past few days. Not impressed...however, it is still better than shaving at the sink.</li>
    <li> I originally bought a 3m brand fogless shower mirror at my local big box store.  It stayed fog free for several months, but eventually started fogging up.  It was a gift for my husband, and we were both pretty disappointed that it was fogging up.  So, for Christmas, I went searching to buy him a new one.  I found this one here on Amazon, and based on the description, and the &amp;#34;highest rated&amp;#34; claim, I thought this would be a perfect replacement.  The company sent me an email after it arrived, with clear instructions on how to put this up and care for it so that you don&#x27;t ruin it.  Apparently you pretty much cannot touch the mirror or you will rub off the protective coating.  They don&#x27;t want this thing getting wet, or anywhere where it might feel the draft of the air outside the shower, so finding the right place to place it is a challenge.  And heaven forbid you should ever want to clean it.  Remember, don&#x27;t touch it.  I went around my house and made every one well aware that they were not to touch the mirror.  Ever.  So, you can imaging how shocked we all were when this thing started fogging up on the very second shower.  It worse than the $10 Command mirror I bought!  Beyond disappointed with this.</li>
    <li> Its excellent, works as described. In the event it gets a little fogged up, run some hot water over it or wipe it clean with some shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Works great in our outdoor shower.</li>
    <li> I missed being able to shave in my shower , Now i can again thanks to the Cassini company &amp; Amazon.I have had it now a month its great  saves time to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirrors, all costing more than this one.  But this one is the best.  It resists fog even if you don&#x27;t warm it up under the shower stream.  This is a great deal!</li>
    <li> Great, good looking mirror that actually works! Glad I picked Cassani</li>
    <li> This mirror is outstanding. I can see very clearly when I am shaving in the shower and the mirror just doesn&#x27;t fog up. It&#x27;s really great technology. I&#x27;ve actually purchased 2. :)</li>
    <li> The  Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror does exactly what is says it will, stays fogless in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror would be good for basically any shower and any bathroom.  It&#x27;s very light weight, easy to mount in the shower and stays in place. The mirror is plastic, so it if falls down, it won’t shatter into glass pieces. How awesome is that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clarity of the mirror itself is also impressive.  I love it for washing my face, removing facial masks and face exfoliators. It&#x27;s seriously incredible.  I like it a lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s large enough to see yourself clearly while shaving in you are a man. My dad loves it and uses it all the time.  It certainly has made his life easier! We are both pleased with this product and would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly every time. Simple product that just does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I would like to start out by saying how much I loved this company. When I emailed them I was answered very quickly after. The person I talked to was the company&#x27;s founder, Michael (no last name was provided). As for the product itself, I loved the concept and it did what it promised. It was completely fogless. It was very simple to attach to my shower and was very well made. I like that the hooks are stainless steel to prevent the from rusting or changing color if they get wet. The mirror itself is very light weight so there is no worry of it being to heavy for the hook. The razor hook is not attached to the mirror so you can put it anywhere you want around the mirror. The thing I do not like about this product is the way it attaches to the shower. The sticky pads feel like you are making a very big commitment and if you want to move the mirror later? Forget about it.I also noticed that on the directions it says do not put the mirror in the direct stream of water. Well, don&#x27;t put it anywhere near where you will actually be using the shower either. I accidentally splashed a little when I was pulling conditioner through my hair, (it&#x27;s a shower, it&#x27;s bound to get a little messy right?) Well now it&#x27;s ruined! In my attempt to get the conditioner off, I guess the layer that makes it fogless got smudged so now it looks like there is goop or something smudged all over it. Very sad. The mirror is still fogless so I will continue to use it but as for actually wanting to inspect my face? Well, I would just say no man can use it to shave now.</li>
    <li> True to its word, it don&#x27;t fog up at all. I like the fact that it is an incredibly simple design, so quick to install, and does not have suction cups.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with this product.  Lightweight, safe to use, easy to install and excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> It does what the description says.  I do love it!</li>
    <li> My husband is retired military.  He does everything in the shower, shaves, brushes his teeth and of course washes his hair.  He always has had some sort of mirror in the shower. Most don&#x27;t last and something is always wrong with them.  Either they steam up or the mirror part fades away but they just don&#x27;t last.  But now I bought this one and boy what a winner.  My husband declares it the best he has EVER had and we have been married 38 years so that is a lot of mirrors. It came beautifully packaged and with good instructions.  When they said it was the best mirror they weren&#x27;t lying.</li>
    <li> Easy to install! Works perfectly for shaving my beard in the shower!</li>
    <li> I liked this sleek kind of mirror. Clarity is really good. I just have to put it in warm shawer for few seconds. Great product.</li>
    <li> I know it&#x27;s been said in other reviews, but if the mirror fogs, run it under the hot water to warm it up.  It should stay fogless for the rest of your shower... Does exactly what it says; easy to mount, fogless, razor hanger is handy.  Good value, no complaints from me.  I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple of months, so I don&#x27;t know about durability, but it&#x27;s very lightweight and the adhesive seems strong enough that it won&#x27;t fall and break anytime soon.  Edit: 3 years later, the mirror is still intact and the hooks are holding strong to the shower wall.  The anti-fog treatment is officially ineffective at this point, but if I warm it in the hot water it clears up long enough to shave.  It&#x27;s been the same for a while now, and I expect it will stay the way it is for a long time.  I may try an auto-glass coating on it or something... Anyway, if it doesn&#x27;t disintegrate or something, I will only grow happier with the price I paid for a useful product and the hooks that came with it.</li>
    <li> This is the best fogless mirror I have ever had.  I have it on the back wall of the shower and I don&#x27;t even have to run shower water on it.  It never fogs up and I just occasionally squeegee it when it get water spray on it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been great so far. I&#x27;ve probably shaved 6 or 7 times with it now and the antifog is still working great. I do remove it from the shower when I&#x27;m not shaving, just because I worry that eventually maybe it will stop working so well, but so far it isn&#x27;t a problem. I have no complaints whatsoever.  And, by the way, shaving in the shower is everything I imagined it to be. I&#x27;ve been using a double-edged razor for a few years and it&#x27;s been great, but doing it in the shower is really an improvement in terms of closeness, minimizing nicks, and avoiding messes.  UPDATE: After a few months it needed cleaned, so we cleaned it very gently with water and a soft cloth. It basically lost its anti-fog properties so I&#x27;m downgrading my rating.</li>
    <li> Excellent design.  The best fogless mirror I&#x27;ve purchased!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve shaved in the shower for decades and have never before found a mirror as clear and usable.  Mine has a small imperfection toward the bottom of it (gives it a fun house effect) but it&#x27;s barely noticeable when I&#x27;m shaving.  It IS more fogless and clearer than any other mirror I&#x27;ve tried.  Good choice.  Buy one!</li>
    <li> IT is a good product. needs constant attention while shaving.  Recommend</li>
    <li> This is the third one I&#x27;m ordering and works as expected. The first one that I ordered was partially working meaning that some parts of the mirror (near the edge) were not fully fogless.&lt;br /&gt;The second one worked just like a regular &amp;#34;foggy&amp;#34; mirror! It was not fogless by no mean. The third one however, is acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All said, please beware. It looks like some batches have a better quality and some others have very poor manufacturing quality. So, if you experienced something like this, you may return it and buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 3/19/15:&lt;br /&gt;The third mirror started getting fog after about a week and it got worse gradually. Now it&#x27;s not fogless anymore and I have to give it a rinse every few minutes. Totally disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> Got this for my boyfriend for Christmas. He just put it up about two weeks ago but it&#x27;s already starting to fog. It&#x27;s a shame because he was really excited for it in our new house!</li>
    <li> This actually works!! I have been using this for couple of months now, and I have no friggin idea how it remains fogless. As a result of this mirror, I shave more often and shaving seems less of a chore when you are getting late to work.</li>
    <li> Works great for its purpose! No fog at all so far. Hanging was easy. An ever so slightly warped reflection, but I expect that from a plastic mirror. Would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This mirror is excellent!  No frills, just does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  It&#x27;s important to know, and I learned the hard way, that in order to clean this mirror, you just clean it with your clean finger under running water.  Don&#x27;t rub the mirror or spray anything on it.  Just gently rub it with your finger under the water and you&#x27;re good to go.  Great mirror, and I love the razor accessory so I can hang that up right next to the mirror in the shower.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this mirror.  We have purchased others that are more expensive and still fog up somewhat.  This one looks great and works as stated.</li>
    <li> Worked great in the beginning and not it doesn&#x27;t work so well. The company was really good at informing you how to maintain the fog free feature but I couldn&#x27;t get it to work. Worth a try though for the price.</li>
    <li> Finally, a shower mirror that really works!</li>
    <li> Mirror is indeed fogless and customer service was excellent with detailed instructions on how to install and maintain the mirror. Time will tell the true quality but so far I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Fogs just as bad as any other mirrors I have tried. Used all the recommendations that were suggested by the company. Would definitely not recommend.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised, and the seller even contacts you to make sure everything&#x27;s perfect. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Lasted exactly four months when whatever was coating the mirror totally was gone. In addition, I hung this right behind the shower head and mold easily formed in the back. I wouldn&#x27;t buy any product that doesn&#x27;t last more than a year. But I guess at the $15 price tag, what could you expect?</li>
    <li> use it all the time. wish i had it years ago.</li>
    <li> Good mirror so far, there is sometime some minor fogging on it but if you run it under water for a second, it clears it up just fine.  I have really like using it so far.</li>
    <li> I have had this shower mirror for a couple of months now. I&#x27;m happy to report that it keeps being &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; with time. I use it almost daily and absolutely love it. Great design and well worth it!</li>
    <li> Works as advertise, does not fog up. Great customer service and product follow up.</li>
    <li> I want to hate this but I can&#x27;t. It works exactly as described, clear and fogless, and therein lies the problem. Since this is used it the shower I&#x27;m now able to see myself in all my natural glory and quite frankly I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s a good thing. However, as long as I focus on my face while shaving this mirror is great. No more missed patches and the steam helps for a smoother cleaner shave.</li>
    <li> Excellent product,  shipped quickly and protected very well.  Double check the height you want the mirror to be positioned before applying the adhesive tape to the shower wall.  I failed to take into account the length of the hanger the hole the mirror hung by which makes the mirror to hang therefore it is 1&amp;#34; - 2&amp;#34; lower than I prefer causing me to stoop over a bit as I shave.  This was fully my mistake and not the companies.  I was concerned removing the tape to reposition it would not make the &amp;#34;tape&amp;#34; strong enough  to told the lightweight mirror while exposed to water and the fog. The razor hook easily holds my Schick razor which has three blades.  My wife also uses it to shave her underarms.&lt;br /&gt;I learned of shaving mirrors from my son and prefer this product over my son&#x27;s mirror which is held in place up by a suction cup.  Highly recommended  product and supplier.&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;</li>
    <li> One star...I know this is brutal but....the mirror&#x27;s name is absolutely a lie.  It is not fogless.  Well, it was fogless for the first week of showers after which it fogs up like any other mirror.  And NO, I did not put any thing on the mirror, not chemicals, not shampoo, not even fingerprints.  The \\&quot;nano\\&quot; technology comment is a scam.  What they probably do is spray this thing with a anti-fog spray and it wears off.    So, it is a cheap plastic mirror with a hook.  This is worth about $5 and I feel scammed.    Amazon, when will you force this item off of your website OR at least change the name and description and anything that points to the \\&quot;joke\\&quot; of fogless?  Your credibility is at risk now.</li>
    <li> This fogless shower mirror is neither fogless or a mirror.  The surface is reflective but its not a clear reflection.  Then if you like hot showers it will be fogged up the entire time.  the instructions say to splash water on it to clear the fog.  that will last for about 20 seconds, then it fogs back up.  I bought this so I could shave while in the shower and after a month I have just given up and gone back to the sink.</li>
    <li> Does not fog up, even after being in the shower for 30minutes and the entire bathroom is a sauna</li>
    <li> Clean design, works as prescribed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned and used this mirror for nearly five months, and I am dismayed to report that, although it worked great when new, the anti-fog coating does not seem to be able to hold up to daily exposure to warm, wet conditions, such as those found in a shower. Over the first couple of months, the coating became less and less effective until it was largely unusable without me first wiping the steam off the mirror. I tried gently cleaning the mirror with warm water and a soft cloth as the instructions recommended, but this only served to dull the reflection, leave noticeable scratches, and cause the fogging problem to get worse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product, especially for people who have smaller showers where they cannot put the mirror out of the way of any water splashing.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I just run it under the shower water and it works great!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fog up. What I would expect for the price. Makes shaving so much easier!</li>
    <li> i bought this for my boyfriend. At first he chuckled and said there is no such thing  as a fogless shower mirror. I said please try it. I&#x27;m  not returning it so try it. iI showed him the stainless steel mounting bracket for the razor and he was slightly impressed and said ok he would try it.  I went over later that evening and he had mounted it and used it and liked it!!!  It didnt fog up.  The SKEPTIC likes it! It&#x27;s gotta be good.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, nice packaging, solid design, works perfectly.  If you&#x27;re a guy, and shave regularly, and don&#x27;t own one of these, it&#x27;s a game changer. Buy this now and enjoy the wonderful world of shower shaving.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a convenient, perfectly sized, easy-to-install mirror, so I can&#x27;t completely hate on it.  But it certainly isn&#x27;t anti-fog.  Two minutes into a hot shower and it is as foggy as a regular bathroom mirror.  Unless they&#x27;re defining &amp;#34;fog&amp;#34; differently than a normal person would define it, I do not understand what is supposed to be &amp;#34;anti-fog&amp;#34; about this.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a basic shaving mirror.  It is exactly as described.  I would have given it more stars if it weren&#x27;t for the annoying DAILY emails from the company on how to clean it.</li>
    <li> Lasted about 30 seconds... After it got hit with some water, the coating immediately started to wrinkle. It wasn&#x27;t even a direct hit of water, just a few sprinkles and steam from a running shower. Also, they automatically subscribe you to an &#x27;advice and tips&#x27; newsletter. No thanks.</li>
    <li> This is an AMAZING mirror! It truly is fogless, and works exactly as described!! The company has great customer service too, they followed up to make sure I got the product, and that everything was working well with it.  The hook for mounting it in the shower works great and holds really tight, and the mirror is CRYSTAL CLEAR the whole time you are in the shower. I took a really long one - over 30 minutes, and it was completely clear the entire time.</li>
    <li> This mirror works well.  If it does get a little foggy, just splash it and it&#x27;s fine again. - easy</li>
    <li> I hang it in the shower morning shave. It is a mirror. It is fog free. Period.</li>
    <li> It does not fog up. Not as clear as I had hoped, however it works fine. No more shaving mess at sink</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had long, but my husband likes real well so far.</li>
    <li> I love my fogless mirror. It is perfect for when I wash my face and get soap in my eyes. I also like that it really is fog less. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now and I have never seen it foggy.</li>
    <li> Constantly fogs up, does not function as what was disclosed.</li>
    <li> This is the best mirror that I have ever purchased! It works just like it says it will. Sorry It took me so long to buy it!</li>
    <li> works ok. Hold up well in the shower however it does fog a tad bit but not enough to make a difference..but then i shower in hot hot hot water</li>
    <li> Guys you won&#x27;t believe it. No more messing with water connections. It really works well and perhaps  better than they represented.</li>
    <li> The Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror has been a life saver for both my hunny &amp; me! He now loves to shave in the shower because he can achieve a flawless shave every time and I love that the bathroom is no longer a mess when he shaves. As for me I love this little mirror Because I can see my self as I put on my face mask or do my daily face cleansing routine while I shower. Included with the Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror you also receive these cute stainless steel mirror and shaving razor wall mounts. I have them set up inside the shower but I love that I can remove the mirror and place it wherever I need it, then place it back in the shower for my hunny. I&#x27;m happy to report that it is indeed fogless. If you&#x27;re looking for a way to be able to see yourself in the shower (whether it&#x27;s for cleaning your face or shaving) be sure to check out the Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I recently received Cassani‘s Fogless Shower Mirror  in return for my honest review.  Initially, I wasn’t sure if I was going to use this, as I am a woman and I do not shave my face!!  I decided to hang it on my shower wall and see if I would use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror is not made of glass, of which I am very happy about – it is plastic, so it if falls down, it won’t shatter into glass pieces.  This was very easy to set up ~ I just placed the hook for the mirror where my face height would be in the shower and pressed it into the wall.  I do wish they used suction cups as once this is in, it is on the wall until you remove it!  The razor hook was a nice addition, as we ladies do shave other body parts as well.  The hooks are made of stainless steel, so hopefully, they will not rust.  The finish is a brushed steel finish, the mirror is not bulky and does not take up a lot of space.  It is very functional and will not clash with any bathroom design, imho.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found, now that it is hanging in my shower, that I am bringing my tweezers into my shower!  This is so handy for me to pluck my eyebrows and any other stray hairs I might find around my face.  I also find that this is helpful with my cleansers and pore brush, so I can ensure that I cleanse my face and not miss any spots that need special attention.  The mirror, so far, has not fogged up and I’ve been using it for over a week now.  It is important to follow the cleaning instructions and not use glass cleaner or any other chemicals.  Just use water and a soft cloth to clean ~ otherwise, it will destroy the anti-fogging properties of the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am pleasantly surprised at how much I use my mirror in the shower as I never had one before and never thought to add one there.  It wasn’t something, as a woman, I felt I needed, as I don’t shave my face.  But I do inspect my face a lot for acne, trouble spots, pluck my eyebrows/stray hairs, so this turned out to be a winner for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> Great product, and looks great in my new shower.  Fogless as advertised.  I have had several shower mirrors in the past and they all fall, but this one does not.</li>
    <li> Have to be honest it went beyond my expectations. It hasn&#x27;t fogged in the shower, it hasn&#x27;t fallen off, and best of all my sink is constantly clean  now!</li>
    <li> Bought this mirror for my husband for his birthday. He loves it. It doesn&#x27;t fog up and is large enough that he can see hi whole face.</li>
    <li> The reviews are correct. This is an excellent product and a great price!</li>
    <li> It does its job and it is uncomplicated. I wish I could say the same for everything else in my life.</li>
    <li> My husband is happy with this mirror.  You have to run water on the mirror for the fogless effect to work, but it works well.</li>
    <li> This product is the best invention ever! I don&#x27;t know why I love this product so much! Its the best because now my mirror in my bathroom is not fogged up at all when I am using the bathroom. It&#x27;s the best thing ever!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t want to bother returning, but wouldn&#x27;t buy again&lt;br /&gt;Light, nice shape and size, easy mounting, but fogged from first use</li>
    <li> Great product. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product that I bought for my dad for Christmas. He loves it and it adheres very strongly to the wall.</li>
    <li> I was chosen to receive for free and give an honest opinion about the Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror on Tomoson.com. I have used this mirror and it does exactly what it promises, it is little mirror to place in your shower that won&#x27;t fog up. Now, I think that this mirror was designed for men I&#x27;m mind because it&#x27;s slogan is for a perfect shave every time (or something along those lines) and the packaging has a picture of a man shaving his face. I am not a man, so cannot rate how good this product is for that, I can rate it on what I used it for though and that was to get my face wash applied evenly everywhere and it was great for that use. The only note I want to make about this product is that it is not a glass mirror (which I think is how it is fog less), so if that is what you are looking for this is not. On a scale of 1-10, with 1 being horrible and 10 being amazing, I give this product a solid 8 and the only reason I am not giving it a 10 is because I cannot rate it on how it is for shaving and that seems to be its main function.</li>
    <li> Easy to mount, so far no issues with fogging. It fogs  up eventually, but a quick swipe of the hand and its good to go. Bought one for sons and husband.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really sure what some of the people who disliked this product were expecting, but it is exactly as described and works really well. Yes, it&#x27;s not real glass. Who would want a real piece of glass in the shower anyway? I don&#x27;t wan&#x27;t it to get knocked down accidentally and cut me.</li>
    <li> The mirrir arrived quickly and has performed exactly like it was described. The mirror truly is fog free, no matter how hot the shower! First shower mirror I&#x27;ve ever owned that always stayed clear. Definitely worth the small price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different mirrors in the past, but this is the only one that stays fog free. It also does not have a distorted reflection its very clear.</li>
    <li> I have purchased so many &amp;#34;fog less mirrors&amp;#34; over the years that I have a low set of expectations for these purchases.  It works. 4 weeks into using it and it&#x27;s already diminishing in &amp;#34;anti-fog&amp;#34; ability.  I&#x27;ve yet to purchase any fog less mirror that did not eventually become useless.  When this one dies, I&#x27;ll try another</li>
    <li> Very lightweight. Easy installation.  If this does get fogged(which it may if you breath on it....) just rinse with water and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> great price, and like the way it installs - you can take the mirror off the hook when you need, then just hang it back up. and if it falls, i don&#x27;t think it would break. would recommend!</li>
    <li> So far so good. Just warm it with shower water and it is as clear as glass.</li>
    <li> Great mirror for shaving! The packaging is a little cheesy but don&#x27;t let it fool you. This mirror is easy to install and easy to use. You do have to run it under water when you first get in the shower as it has to be a similar temperature to your shower. The razor holder is also handy. Great, inexpense way to be able to shave in the shower!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product for free to review. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> A great shaving mirror. Works exactly as intended.</li>
    <li> Best Shower Mirror Ever!!</li>
    <li> This thing works great.</li>
    <li> After about 1 use, the &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; feature disappeared. However, the mirror itself works and is very useful. I turn the showerhead on it and the mirror then clears up and is usable. It does what I need it to do. Would I buy again? Yes.</li>
    <li> Love this mirror I use it every day in the shower. I will not use any other mirror. I finely found the best shower mirror</li>
    <li> Best shower mirror especially for the price!&lt;br /&gt;Just wipe with wet hand in shower and it stays clear the whole time. Ive been shaving and using shower mirrors for 20 yrs and like this one the best!</li>
    <li> It really does not fog unlike the cheaper versions that you see for sale online. Make sure to take off both the clear film on the front and the paper film on the back. Both may be hard for people with short nails (I had my wife take them off after wasting 10 minutes). It&#x27;s not the fanciest design, but sometimes less is better.</li>
    <li> Made the mistake of throwing the&lt;br /&gt; box away, before I tried this fogless mirror. Two days later in the shower it went to fogless mirror to a fog mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheap to much money spent.</li>
    <li> What a complete piece of junk!! It was fogless for about 2 weeks and then got progressively worse. After about 4 weeks it was absolutely useless.I have no idea how this is top rated.</li>
    <li> Sorry to say, this does not work. Not a one off either, as I had bought another for my son, and his does not do the job either. You have to continually shove it under the shower to clear the fog. My standard bathroom mirror actually clears down faster.</li>
    <li> mirror gets the job done. definitely not fogless, immediately fogged up when the water came on. gets the job done though.</li>
    <li> Beautiful in its simplicity. Crystal clear, and if it does fog up (e.g., me taking a hotter than usual shower), rinsing it under the shower water clears it right up. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> At first, this was great because it would not fog up at ALL, no matter how hot the shower was. I wouldn&#x27;t even need to rinse off the front or back of the mirror before using to make it anti-fog (unlike other shower mirrors bought on Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I installed it in the shower, the mirror was great and fogless for several weeks without me ever needing to touch it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas, all good things come to an end...I think eventually the anti-fog coating wore down and now my mirror keeps fogging up, once or twice per shower. Now, just like the other fogless mirrors on Amazon, I have to quickly rinse off the back and front of the mirror with the warm shower water to keep it from fogging up.</li>
    <li> Very handy item that speeds up my morning.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror in October of 2014, but only took it out of the packaging and put it up in early November. It was great for the first few months, but now gets fogged up in a very short time. Rinsing it off only buys you about 30 seconds of clarity before it&#x27;s back to its foggy and peeling* self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It&#x27;s not peeling, exactly. More like uneven deterioration showing up as semi-opaque swirls</li>
    <li> Perfect product; even better customer service</li>
    <li> No complaints.  Best fog-less mirror I have owned.  Simple and useful.  No gimmicks. Exactly what I like in products.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Delivered on time and works perfectly. No longer do I have to get out of the shower to shave head and beard. Awesome!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this mirror for a while now. It worked great for the first few months. However, the after the first time I rinsed it off (with the shower water, as instructed), the mirror did not hold it&#x27;s anti-fog properties. I have to rinse it with water every time I use it (which is not a huge deal). However, I have tried other &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirrors and this one works much better than other ones that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other complaint is that you can&#x27;t move the mirror after it&#x27;s been attached. It attaches to the shower wall with an adhesive which means the mirror does not fall down (like a suction cup), but also that if you move or decide to move the mirror, you can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, I love being able to shave in the shower. It saves time and I get a better shave because of it.</li>
    <li> works as described.  Excellent followup emails from the seller on how to install and clean.  Solid customer followup.</li>
    <li> I love it. I took down an inferior mirror bc it always fogged over and in short I was sick of it. It was a expensive Simple Human brand one I bought for way more than this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only wish is for the razor holder to hold two razors as now I have no where to hang my girlfriends razor! Lol.</li>
    <li> Works really well. Very happy I bought it. Would buy again if my first one breaks or something.</li>
    <li> Was fogless for about a week - now fogs up almost immediately! Sad!</li>
    <li> works perfect but do make sure you read the directions. Do NOT use cleaners on it. It will stop working. Our cleaner accidentally did and we had to buy a second one.</li>
    <li> After trying 3 different shower mirrors, so far....this one is the best.  It actually stays where you place it, is a good size and the razor holder is a nice feature.  I also appreciate the finish on the hooks.  FINALLY, a shower mirror that is not on the floor the following morning.</li>
    <li> While the mirror worked well at first, and the hook holds firm to the wall.  The &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; portion only lasted for a short period of time.  Now the center portion seems to have lost the &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; that made it fogless and it fogs up almost instantly.  Now I constantly need to rinse it in order to be able to see.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t even see out of the thing. Worst product ever! It was like this right from the start. I can&#x27;t even say one good thing about this product.  There is no protection from the fog. It is not for the shower. Unfortunately there is no estimate of less than 1</li>
    <li> Works as advertised!! I like it!</li>
    <li> I have had it for almost a week and so far so good. The hook has stayed attached to the wall. It was a problem I had with another brand, but this one is staying on.</li>
    <li> Let me preface by saying the mirror itself works exactly as advertised - adheres *extremely* well to shower tile and barely fogs even with 20+ minutes of steam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the idiom &amp;#34;measure twice, cut once&amp;#34; is very important with this product! The mirror is slightly smaller than your head and the mounting unit can&#x27;t be removed without destroying the adhesive, so take care with placing it exactly where you&#x27;ll see it best. I accidentally adhered mine ~3 inches below eye level and realized too late that it can&#x60;t be removed or repositioned without buying a new mount. Ideally it would use a suction cup, but that would be much less secure so I can&#x27;t really blame the manufacturer for my own poor planning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there was a solution for repositioning the mirror without buying an entire new unit, I would gladly raise this review to 5 stars :)</li>
    <li> Mirror looks good.&lt;br /&gt;I have hanged on the hook, that was included with the mirror, inside my shower stall.&lt;br /&gt;Is it fogless?  Nope, but it doesn&#x27;t matter that much to me.&lt;br /&gt;I just warm it up in the shower, hang it on the hook and I have no problem seeing my ugly face.</li>
    <li> After first receiving this I would have given it 5 stars. Two to three months later I would have given it 4 stars. I now give it three stars because it has continually fogged up more, and more quickly as time has passed. It&#x27;s to the point where I may just throw it away. I&#x27;ve tried cleaning it with a soft towel and soap, toothpaste, and even coated it with shampoo (it worked until it was washed off).  I still give it three stars because it worked great for a few months and it wasn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not totally fogless. Much better than a regular mirror, but I still have to wipe it during use to get rid of fog. It just doesn&#x27;t fog up as quickly as a regular mirror.</li>
    <li> My wife and kids bought this for my birthday last year (the day after Christmas) and I loved it! The reviews alone made me want to open it immediately and have a nice shower and shave. It worked flawlessly for the first month and then began to fog immediately. For the last 2 months I have been showering and staring at my FOG mirror and wondering what happened to it&#x27;s magical powers. I finally took a picture and decided to post this review. What did I do to mine that no one else did toy theirs? I don&#x27;t know. I read the cleaning instructions. Never cleaned it. Not once. It needed to be rinsed ONCE. I rinsed it and then... FOG. Can you really not rinse this magical mirror? Is water it&#x27;s Lex Luthor? I surely hope not. Not for a mirror meant to be used in the shower. Anyway. I got to shave in the shower for a nice 30 days. Now I&#x27;m back at the sink remembering the good times I had once upon a time. Just me, my razor, and my once loved Fogless Mirror.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a number of shower mirrors over the years and finally found the perfect one.  It&#x27;s clean, simple and works perfect in my shower space.  I would highly suggest anyone that prefers shaving in the shower to try this item, it will not disappoint!</li>
    <li> Worked for about 5 days. Now it fogs worse than the bathroom mirror. Too bad it was really nice while it lasted.</li>
    <li> Worked great for the first couple of days then completely fogged up.  So much for fogless.</li>
    <li> Only fogless when you first get it. Had my first one replaced because it started fogging up on the first day, second one took a little longer. Shopping around now for a good replacement.</li>
    <li> Great product, at a great price.</li>
    <li> Fogs up - has from the very first day</li>
    <li> The mirror is not fogless. However, the nature of the design makes it serviceable. The mirror attaches to a hook that is mounted to the shower wall using adhesive tape. As soon as the mirror fogs up, I need to unhook the mirror and run it under water. This will yield approximately 1-2 minutes of fog-free use.  I usually have to run it under water twice to complete my shave. I would have probably returned the mirror if I had not already affixed the hook to the wall. While the mirror easily attaches and detaches from the mounted hook, it certainly does not meet its claim of being a fogless mirror. Thus, the two star review.</li>
    <li> Terrible. Gets foggy in like 2 mins. Thanks</li>
    <li> Does not work. Fogs up immediately.  Feels like I was duped by all the positive reviews.  Look elsewhere!</li>
    <li> Worked once and fogged up ever since -- sent it back</li>
    <li> You have to shave at the beginning of your shower because it fogs up a bit by the end.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Works as expected</li>
    <li> Does not work like they advertise. And they never refund my money.&lt;br /&gt;Do not bother buying it.</li>
    <li> Item shipped and was delivered quickly. Did not fog up the first two times. But now constantly fogs even during a quick 10 minute shower. Attempted to clean the glass in hopes that it would resolve the problem, but it fogs up SIGNIFICANTLY and must be wiped every minute.</li>
    <li> I must admit i was a little skeptical at first so i put this mirror to the test. I made sure to take the hottest, steamiest shower i could. Needless to say i was truly impressed that it did not fog up at anytime. I was able to see perfectly clear to apply my face cleanser. I would definately recommend this for anyone who shaves in the shower or washes their face. It is quite an innovative product. Please note that i did recieve this product for free but my review is my own, honest opinion!</li>
    <li> unfortunately the shower mirror that claims to be Fogless is not so... I have to wipe it constantly to see when I shave.</li>
    <li> it is not truly completely fogless, but it&#x27;s still good enough to shave with.  I put a little soapy water in my hand and smear it on there and then  it stays pretty fogless.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. Much clearer than my previous fogless mirror. Easy to mount, and easy to maintain.</li>
    <li> Mirror fogs up as soon as the shower comes on. Completely false advertising. BS!!!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this fogless shower mirror!! He was actually the one who opened the packaged before I could. We have been shopping around for a mirror that wouldn&#x27;t fog in the shower, so that he can shave, being that he is a hairy faced man, I wouldn&#x27;t like when he shaved over the faucet. However, we came across this product , to try out, and its amazing. Easy and simple assembly and even comes with a razor holder which is also a plus.</li>
    <li> The mirror definitely fogs very easily and fell off the shower wall within a week and won&#x27;t stay up since.</li>
    <li> Best shower mirror I&#x27;ve ever had. Not fogless (spoiler: none of them are), but it hangs on a hook and is VERY easy to rinse off. Clear view without distortion, like is common for many shower mirrors. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> On time and as described. Great for shaving!</li>
    <li> Was great the first week, but after i rinsed the mirror It actually does accumulate fog. No chemicals, no cleaners, just running water</li>
    <li> Product works alright. The company does an outstanding job at contacting you for concerns etc.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says it would do. The mirror has never fogged and has stayed crystal clear. It is a great size and easily installed. This mirror is half the price of similar mirrors, and I would definitely go with this one.</li>
    <li> Worked well for a couple months and now its useless, water beads up on it. I kept it on the opposite end of the shower from the shower head.</li>
    <li> The fog free didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> Great Price, product and quick shipping</li>
    <li> So far very good. Time, though will tell if it keeps working!</li>
    <li> Works really well and I would suggest others get it for the price it is hard to beat the deal.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. The test will be how it performs over time, but I&#x27;m optimistic that it will be clear for more than a year.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it.  Great mirror for the price.  Was worried about quality with the price but there was no need to worry.</li>
    <li> Great mirror so far.  It arrived on time</li>
    <li> Does not. Did not. Will not work. Fogs every time, just like a regular mirror.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine for what it is, a little distorted, but not so bad that you look like the elephant man or anything crazy like that. My one bone to pick is the razor hook. It does not stay on the mirror. It keeps falling at the worse times and waking up my kids from their naps (we live in a tiny place where every sound is magnified). Argh! If this part would work, I would love it 100%!</li>
    <li> I have ordered two of these. The first one worked great until my wife wiped off all the nanoparticles with some glass cleaner. I told her not to do that and I ordered a second one and apparently it has no nanoparticles on it because it fogged up from the gitgo. I still use it, I just have to hit it warm water first and it will stay fairly clear, long enough for me to shave.</li>
    <li> The layer of chemicals on the glass that&#x27;s supposed to prevent fogging is flaking off after a couple months use, though it never really did prevent fogging at a level where i didn&#x27;t need to wipe the mirror off with my hand.</li>
    <li> No fogging for the first 3 showers.  After that, fogs just like any mirror.  The only reason that I did not give it 1 star is that when I am ready to shave, I can hold the mirror in the water stream (front and back) and I can just about complete shaving prior to it fogging again.</li>
    <li> Quality materials. Performance as promised. Detailed instructions for easy installation. Great customer service followup.Very pleased with this purchase. Exceeded expectations.</li>
    <li> Perfect for a outdoor shower and easy to install</li>
    <li> It is hard to get too excited over a mirror but this one does work well and is slightly larger than other fog-less mirrors I have seen.  The backing seems to be some kind of water proof paper resin so i am not sure how it will do over the long haul but so far it is working great.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a mirror that I could put in the shower that wouldn’t fog up so my hubby could see what he was doing while shaving. I love that this mirror is family friendly. It is not made out of glass so small children won’t have a chance of breaking it. It comes with a hook to hang your shaver and one to hang the mirror. Its not the suction cup kind so that’s great. I always have bad luck with that kind constantly falling down.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great gift for the men in your life. Disclosure: I received this for free as long as I provided my honest opinion, all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Excellent products. Very honest company. Recomended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this mirror up in my shower for two months now and it performs flawlessly!  As for the reviews which criticize the mirror coating, READ THE INSTRUCTIONS.  I&#x27;m sure those types are using something other than a soft terry cloth and water to clean it; I&#x27;ll put money on it!  It specifically states in the instructions NOT to use any cleaning substance of any kind to clean the mirror. Anything caustic will destroy the anti-fog coating.  So there!  This is a superior product and it works exactly as advertised!  Update 5/29/2015.  The mirror worked fine for about 8 months and then completely lost it&#x27;s coating and now fogs up like the rest.  I never used anything but water and a terry towel to wipe it down.  I feel duped.</li>
    <li> We love it! It truly works and it stays in place! We have tried others but they did not work as good as this one.</li>
    <li> Loved it in the beginning, worked great, looks, like the hooks. After a couple of weeks though I started getting less and less visibility. After a couple months it was very cloudy and useless even though I cleaned it with toothpaste per the instructions several times. I think it got cleaned with some chemicals early on and that likely did it. Bought a different one to replace it, we&#x27;ll see how long that one lasts.</li>
    <li> This is a great little mirror and is definitely fog less as advertised, and I do spend some time in the shower :)  The holders are great and doesn&#x27;t look like it will fall off at all.  Overall, a quality product!</li>
    <li> My husband says it&#x27;s great, he wants another one for other shower!</li>
    <li> Works well. Stays clear even with lots of steam around it. Shipped fast. Definitely recommend</li>
    <li> THE MIRROR ARRIVED IN A SIZE APPROPRIATE PACKAGE AND IN THE TIME FRAME THEY SAID IT WOULD ARRIVE. THE MIRROR ITSELF WAS ACTUALLY PACKAGED IN A PIECE OF CARDBOARD TO HELP PREVENT IT FROM SHATTERING DURING SHIPPING. IT WAS EASY TO UNPACKAGED AND TO HANG BOTH THE PIECE FOR THE MIRROR AND THE RAZOR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INSTALLATION OF PRODUCT WAS EASY AND KINDA FUN. IT DEFINITELY MAKES IT EASIER TO GROOM IN THE SHOWER NOW BECAUSE I DON’T HAVE TO LEAVE THE SHOWER OR USE A HANDHELD MIRROR THAT I HAVE TO CONSTANTLY WIPE CLEAN EVERY FEW SECONDS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE CASSANI FOGLESS MIRROR. TRY IT YOURSELF OR BE A GOOD FRIEND AND SEND IT AS A GIFT. THIS IS JUST MY OPINION.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> This is the first shower mirror that REALLY works so that you can see your whole face clearly.  I&#x27;ve tried many other brands and they fog up to a point where you can barely see the outline of your face.  This product is the real McCoy.</li>
    <li> Only used a week but 100% better than my old one so far......</li>
    <li> Works absolutely perfect. Definitely recommend.  I am tall so I just hold the mirror with one hand while a shave with the other and it&#x27;s perfect. Company emailed me 3 times after I received item to ensure my satisfaction. Awesome on  a product as inexpensive as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Quality product. Easy to hang, easy to use. Fogless and very clear. Really like the razor hanger. Would buy again!</li>
    <li> Works great so far. The material really does resist fogging up, and to get rid of the droplet spots, I just wet the entire mirror. The surface is so smooth that the film of water on it remains perfectly uniform and transparent. The razor holder is also nicely sized and fits both modern cartridge razors as well as double-sided razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One potential concern is the strength of the adhesive in a high humidity setting. So far, so good though.</li>
    <li> Mirror is working great and in the winter I take hot showers...this has not affected the mirror at all, it stays clear enough to shave for me during the entire shower....  I would highly recommend this mirror at this time.....I am curious to see how long it will work....I have instructed everyone in the house on how to use the mirror so that no one cleans it and removes the magical affects...</li>
    <li> This mirror looks is so simplistically designed that it will look good in any bathroom. I like the design of the mirror and it looks really nice hanging in my shower. I know this mirror is for the &amp;#34;perfect shave&amp;#34; and since I am female, I do not have the need to shave my face but it comes in handy when I am washing my face in the shower. I have also found myself plucking my eyebrows in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live with two guys so when they shave, they always leave their hair in the sink which is just gross. Yuck! Now that the mirror is in the shower and it doesn&#x27;t fog up, there is no longer any hair in the sink which is a major bonus. This mirror is great and definitely fulfills the no fog promise. I would definitely recommend this product to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****Update: I am removing two stars from my review as the mirror has begun to fog up. It was really disappointing to see the mirror start to fog all of a sudden after months of it being fogless, no matter how hot of a shower I was taken. I followed the instructions for cleaning and cannot understand why it started to fog up unexpectedly. It has made it harder for me to remove facial masks and cleansers while in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product for free for testing and review purposes from Tomoson.com. However, all views and opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> Nice simple design.  The hanging part is easy to use and very strong.  Unfortunately, this mirror was only fogless for about 2 weeks.  After the second week, it would fog more and more every time.  After a month, the mirror fogs over in a minute of hot shower.  All instructions were followed.  No cleaning agents have ever touched the mirror, but it still fogs.  For me to even use the mirror to shave in the shower, I now have to smear a light layer of soap over the surface of the glass,  That&#x27;ll give me about 3 minutes of fog free tie to shave.</li>
    <li> So far this mirror has been amazing. I can finally shave and wash my face in the shower and see what I&#x27;m doing. The last mirror I had was a suction cup style that kept falling off and would fog up. Not this one!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this. Absolutely no fog on the mirror in a steamy shower, which is what I bought it for. Aesthetically, it doesn&#x27;t have a frame, which would be nice, but this price is unbeatable.</li>
    <li> It really is fogless. Great deal for the price.</li>
    <li> Got this for the boyfriend. He loves it already! It&#x27;s not too pricey, so it was fun to get him a little gift &amp;#34;just because.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Pretty good mirror but still fogs a little if you have a small bathroom and like hot showers. Rinsing it in the hot stream for a few seconds does the trick.</li>
    <li> First I must say the company selling this is five stars. They follow up with you after purchase to make sure your satisfied. They even sent me another mirror at no charge when mine fogged up almost immediately after getting in the shower within the first month. BUT I think they are selling a product that just can not be made to work. I have had other fogless mirrors in the past and their life span is always short. I thought I would give this one a try and again I&#x27;m disappointed with the product not the company. The replacement mirror fogged up on the first shower. It seems like to coating was applied unevenly because the middle fog differently than the outside of the mirror. Either way I surrender. My only solution is to wet the mirror under the running water and shave quickly because in 90 seconds it&#x27;s fogged up again. I&#x27;m open to any suggestions on what to do next but I&#x27;m resigned to just accept the fact that these things don&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> JUNK!  Fogged up as soon as we used it the first time.  Again total Junk!  Don&#x27;t waste your $$</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase from the Cassani Company. Mirror is great and customer service from the seller was excellent!</li>
    <li> This was a disappointment considering the rave reviews it got from other users.  In fact, I wonder if they are legit.  My first issue is that it is marked &amp;#34;Durable&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;For travel&amp;#34;.  But I made the mistake of touching the mirror face while installing it which left a fingerprint.  I tried to wipe it off with a towel but managed to scratch the surface.  With a Towel!! The coating is super soft and can even be marred by the pressure from the pad of my finger.  The mirror does resist fog, but when taking a shower, I have to shave first because within a couple of minutes, the condensation starts running down the mirror in fine rivulets, making it difficult to see much detail.</li>
    <li> Excellent!  Follow the recommendations, don&#x27;t use cleaners, soft cloth, warm water only, and it will work perfect for you!</li>
    <li> I never shaved in the shower before getting this mirror. Man was I missing out. It makes the morning easier and getting ready quicker. The mirror doesn&#x27;t fog. And if you get water drops on it, you can easily wipe them off with your hand and instantly see a perfectly clear reflection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sticky attachment was easy to install and seems sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the mirror for a few weeks now and I really enjoy it.</li>
    <li> I recently moved and left my old mirror behind.  I had no complaints about it really until I got this mirror.  It was one of those mirrors you had to fill with hot water whenever you wanted to shave, which was a pain. Also, it was really wide, and short, so I could only see the bottom half of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no hassle with filling this mirror with water.  The most I&#x27;ve ever done is quickly run it under the hot water, and any fog that was there disappears.  Its easy to get off and on its hook, so I don&#x27;t have to mess with trying to get it back into its mount.  It&#x27;s the perfect length and width, and I can actually see my whole face now, without distortion!  My other mirror also cost 3x the price of this mirror.  Really, this is a great mirror for the price.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best shower mirror I have ever used. It really performs as advertised. For a more spirited review read Beau Chevassus&#x27;s review below. Beau knows a good mirror when he sees one (and himself so clearly).</li>
    <li> I needed a mirror in the shower that did not fog up. This does that and is very easy to hang on the wall. The razor hanger is an added bonus. This is perfect.</li>
    <li> the mirror  is now in our shower. it was easy to hang and it&#x27;s hung on a tile wall, with no problems</li>
    <li> My husband is very pleased with this mirror.</li>
    <li> Used many for less mirrors for shaving but they eventually all end up fogging after time. From the reviews I was excited that finally a fogless mirror! Hangs great, very light weight. No suction cups.. Bonus there.. Bad news was it fogged up right off the bat. Had to do the usual splash water on it trick, but within seconds foggy again.  I guess the people saying it doesn&#x27;t fog take cold showers</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from the low price point, but it actually is amazing. Ratings are true for this one. You may have to run it under the shower sometimes to remove the fog, but it doesn&#x27;t fog back up after that. It really is perfect and even better for the price.  The $50+ ones are definitely not worth it after experiencing this one.</li>
    <li> This arrived quickly and was simple to install.  So far it is completely fog less in the shower as advertised. I like that it is not glass and is very light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Augist 2015.  Well, it is still okay but the &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t so much anymore.  :-(</li>
    <li> Had it for a couple of weeks. So far it is great. No fogging and I can shave easily. The little hook they provide for the razor is helpful. Recommended</li>
    <li> Perfect, worth every penny. Easily use 3M strips to hold outside shower for added usage when bathroom is steamy :) Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Best shower mirror I have owned, and I have tried more than a few.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive product that performs as advertised.  Stays fog free without rinsing or wiping.  Adhesive mount perfect for tile that isn&#x27;t smooth.</li>
    <li> The best mirror I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Clean, simple, easy to install.</li>
    <li> Awesome - Works great!&lt;br /&gt;been through 4 or 5 others and this one is IT!</li>
    <li> Good quality build. Nice clean finish. The mirror doesn&#x27;t fog up. There is even a matching razor holder, which is a nice touch to save valuable shower space! It saves me time shaving in the shower and time is a precious commodity! Five stars.</li>
    <li> I placed the mirror in a place where it was splashed with water and sometimes shampoo.  These create stains.  I was able to clean the stains with wet newspaper. However this takes off the anti-fog technology.  I suggest not spraying with water or placing in a place where the mirror will be splashed.  Just wipe with wet hand if foggy.    Simple design and probably and the best on Amazon. .</li>
    <li> Works as described and truly doesn&#x27;t fog up.</li>
    <li> Life has been so much easier now that I shave in the shower. It is much more convenient. This mirror began to fog after a couple weeks, but a quick spray with the shower head and its clear.</li>
    <li> It works. but they wont stop emailing you about it.</li>
    <li> Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror is a mirror (not glass) that you can hang in your shower for those times when you need to see your reflection. It is great for shaving, washing, teeth brushing, and many other showering tasks.  Cassani  uses an  Anti-Fog Nanotechnology on the mirror to repel fog, and it clearly works. The mirror does not fog, even in the hottest shower conditions, and the mirror is a good size for any shower.  It is very lightweight and is not made of glass, so it is safe.  The package did contain a stainless steel hook for hanging and another for your razor. The  hanging hook is sturdy, yet the mirror is easily detached from the hook so you can take it with you.I have used this mirror for 14 days with no negative issues and I have enjoyed using it in the shower.  It is so easy now to wash my face in the shower using this mirror. I love it that now I can see what I am scrubbing!</li>
    <li> NIce mirror, works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Great mirror for shower</li>
    <li> It worked great for the first 3 weeks. Now it fogs up everytime I get into the shower. I followed all the instructions, i.e. Not putting it close to the shower head, not using and cleaning chemicals. It sits about 4 feet from the shower head and I use a microfiber cloth to clean and only use water to cleanse it. To use it, I have to run it under water 5 or 6 times every time I shave because it fogs up so bad. Don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have had this product now for 2 months and the mirror now fogs up within 45 seconds of turning on the shower. This product is worthless.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised simple kit.  Adhesive hook for mirror, and adhesive mount for your razor.  Doesn&#x27;t fog up, usable for my purposes in the shower.  :)</li>
    <li> Good quality.  Works great!</li>
    <li> My experiance is that it will stay fogless until a drop of water is splashed on it.  The drop seems to act like a &amp;#34;seed&amp;#34; and the mirror fogs up.  I then just take it off the hook and run it under the shower and works fine for the short period of time I need.</li>
    <li> after a few showers it started to fog</li>
    <li> I have never even had to rinse my mirror in order to keep it from fogging. it just works. It&#x27;s a great size and the sticky adhesive is very effective.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the mirror hung in the shower for about a week.  Having read other reviews that says the anti-fogging function gradually fades away, it is too soon to give it a 5.  The mirror was easy to put up and has not fallen off yet which was my biggest concern.  The razor holder is handy, as well.  Well worth the price so far.</li>
    <li> best mirror i have ever used. no fog</li>
    <li> Works very well and easy to install!</li>
    <li> So far works well.  Hopefully it will remain fog less as others have not in the past.  Easy to install.</li>
    <li> Received the mirror, cleaned the area (ceramic tile) with rubbing alcohol, and placed the adhesive hook to the wall...did this before going to bed and allowed it to settle/adhere to the tile wall in my shower...in the morning, the hook was on the ground of the shower, adhesive is shot (it will not go back onto the wall and stick) and now I am sans shower mirror for my shower...I should&#x27;ve known better than to take the bait on a gimmick purchase...oh well...</li>
    <li> Works great.  Install painless.  Doesn&#x27;t fog in the shower.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I received this kit, courtesy of Mike at Cassani Company. Sadly, the folks I live with wouldn&#x27;t allow me to mount this to the shower wall, and truth be told, I&#x27;d be afraid to mount it to our shower wall. Anyway, included in the kit is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~An oval mirror&lt;br /&gt;~A Stainless Steel Mirror Wall Hook (with adhesive backing)&lt;br /&gt;~A Stainless Steel Razor Holder (with adhesive backing)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the folks I live with wouldn&#x27;t allow me to mount this to the shower wall, I had to improvise and lean it against the wall. I turned our shower on and washed my hair, letting the steam from the shower fill the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror DOES stay fog-free. However, after handling it, it feels cheap and plasticy... The back of the mirror looks to be of pressed board. I&#x27;m not 100% sure the hardware (the wall hook and the razor holder) are actually stainless steel, as the company claims. They feel extremely too light to be stainless steel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as disabled people using this, I think the HARDEST thing you will encounter is affixing the hardware to the shower wall. If you have a shower caddy with hooks, it MAY be easier to just use one of the hooks on the caddy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure this would be a great mirror for travelling, like to prop against a dresser for makeup or as a handheld mirror for plucking/tweezing, but as for home use, I&#x27;d feel more secure using a mirror with suction cups or a shower caddy with hooks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FINAL THOUGHTS&lt;br /&gt;The mirror DOES live up to it&#x27;s promises, but I would be scared that the adhesive would give way, and I&#x27;d have a broken mirror in my bathtub.&lt;br /&gt;WOULD RECOMMEND: Probably not.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it. He says it works perfect! Glad I got it for him.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know how much I would really use a shower mirror, being that I&#x27;m not a male and don&#x27;t shave my face. But, I actually use it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;The mirror itself is 6&amp;#34; wide X 7.5&amp;#34; tall. It has stainless steel hooks and has a brush steel chrome finish. It&#x27;s very handsome looking and would go with virtually any decor.&lt;br /&gt;I found that I use it often. It&#x27;s easy to use, just use a little warm water and rub with your finger and voila! it&#x27;s fogless!&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Big mirror that doesn&#x27;t fog up--great.</li>
    <li> Item is slightly more fog-resistant than an average mirror, but not as fogless as advertised, and the coating does not last long. It&#x27;s also cheaply made, and was instantly ruined by wiping with a soft cloth.</li>
    <li> Worked for one week, then started fogging up, even when rinsed off in water quickly</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great to know that the box also includes hooks/mounts that already have an adhesive tape attached to it. It holds the mirror well and it doesn&#x27;t fall.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this. The adhesive used to hold the metal hook to the shower tiles works really well. Mirror will fog up initially; but give it a quick wipe with your hand, and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit I bought this because of the all the positive reviews, which is why I&#x27;m baffled by what I ended up receiving. Though the mirror definitely stays fog free compared to an average shower mirror, it&#x27;s become essentially unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the mirror came out of the box with a strange residue in three spots. It&#x27;s not sticky, but looks like a thin layer of dried glue. I&#x27;m afraid to use a cleaner to remove it for fear of damaging whatever &amp;#34;nanotechnology&amp;#34; film they&#x27;ve applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But worse than that, after just a week, a fine network of strange &amp;#34;scratches&amp;#34; started to appear, seemingly under the mirror film. The surface itself isn&#x27;t perceptibly rough, but it seems like the reflective sheet itself has buckled/cracked underneath, like the way a car window will crack into a million pieces from one blow. And then there&#x27;s another network of even smaller cracks superimposed on that, over only part of the mirror. These cracks are so small that it, ironically, looks like fog. In bright light (like you would use to shave), these cracks make the mirror entirely unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And no, I didn&#x27;t use anything to clean the mirror other than water and a paper towel. I had to go back to the cheap Walmart mirror I was using before - 2.5 years old but at least functional. It&#x27;s hard to get a good picture of the problem, it&#x27;s actually worse than it looks in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I&#x27;m disappointed with this purchase. Maybe I happened to get a bad one, I really don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> Adheres well to the wall of my solid surface stall shower and does really remain fog free.</li>
    <li> Yes its fogless. Yes its awesome. Yes its super easy to install.  No to that 1 guy who says the mirror breaks if you clean it with anything that is not as soft as kittens. I have no idea what that guy is talking about. I bought 1 and then tested it out because of his review and then I bought another one for my second bathroom.  ** OK many months later, i stand corrected.. don&#x27;t wash it with anything or touch it with anything -- it will screw up the reflection. Otherwise it&#x27;s fine. But removing 1 star.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and does a great job. No fog as advertised. light weight and no need for batteries</li>
    <li> Mirror doesn&#x27;t fog up and seems to magnify well.</li>
    <li> Horrible.You couldn&#x27;t see anything when in shower.Dont buy anymore and don&#x27;t recommend for no-one</li>
    <li> *update*  the company contacted me and sent me a replacement free of charge. The mirror is fogless I had it at the hottest temperature and it stayed cleared. It did fog up once but I wet it with water and it cleared up quick.  I was really staring at it and I can see it trying to fog up but it cleared up. Which is pretty awesome. The first mirror I received did not work. But I&#x27;m glad they contacted me and sent me a replacement.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror that&#x27;s effectively fogless and isn&#x27;t lying when it says it&#x27;s easy to install! It&#x27;s also rather stylish being an oval shape instead of boring square!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few shower uses, I can say with confidence that the mirror does not fog up and is very clear while taking a very hot shower. I did not use the hook or razor hook that were included since I am short and my husband is tall, so I wanted to use something more temporary so we could both comfortably use the mirror while showering and move it as needed, so I used my own suction hook I had on hand. So I cannot comment as to the strength of the adhesive on the included hooks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;m not shaving my face (the classic use for a shower mirror) I do like to use it while washing my face to make sure I&#x27;m getting complete coverage when applying my face wash or any other face masks. I have unfortunately gotten out of the shower before with face wash still lurking in the corners of my nose or edges of my hairline, so I very much enjoy having the mirror to avoid that kind of embarrassment again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product complimentary for review purposes but that doesn&#x27;t matter. It does what it claims to do and looks good while doing it, and that&#x27;s my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Great mirror that does the job.</li>
    <li> Like the way it attaches to the shower wall and actually stays there.  Also like the oval shape.  I have yet to find a shower mirror that doesn&#x27;t fog up under normal conditions -- and this is no exception.</li>
    <li> I would give this a zero if I could. After the 3rd shower, this mirror stayed foggy.</li>
    <li> I love this stylish mirror its a perfect size. Easy to install but it does it get foggy. But it is one the best I had so far..</li>
    <li> Mirror fogs up before I can get in the shower. Run it under the shower and wipe it with palm and if II shave quickly I might get done shaving before it fogs up again. Disappointing to say the least.</li>
    <li> the mirror fogs up.  you have to keep throwing water on it.  it lasts about one minute until it fogs again.</li>
    <li> Have to constantly rinse with hot water to clear fog.  Stays fog free after rinsing for no more than 40 seconds.</li>
    <li> Love this. I can&#x27;t believe I went so long without this. It even makes me use a razor longer since you can easily keep track of one at a time and you tend to keep them cleaner.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice design. Simple, border free design works well in an upgraded shower without standing out as tacky or cheap. Like every &amp;#34;fog less&amp;#34; mirror I have ever owned it does fog up but splashing water on it seems to work well. Follow the instructions and do not use cleaning products on it. That will destroy all anti-fog characteristics. Overall, one of the best fog less mirrors out there.</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely fashion. Sleek design. Does exactly what is says it will - stays fogless in the shower. I can&#x27;t tell you how many mirrors I&#x27;ve gone through which claim to be fogless and then they are only semi-fogless at best. Got one of the best shaves of my life using this mirror b/c I didn&#x27;t have any trouble seeing what I was doing.</li>
    <li> Was skeptical at first...but when the mirror arrived and I started using it, I was very satisfied. it is fog free and work well. Also it seems shatterproof. Good product....</li>
    <li> After having a mirror that continually fell off the shower wall, and became more and more covered with water spots, we went searching for a new alternative.  This mirror attaches flat to the wall and really IS fogless and seems to be much less prone to water spots.  Very happy with our purchase and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t this say FOGLESS.  Well if you call having to wipe the mirror every stoke of your shave.  Fogs up every time no better then the 3 dollar one at Riteaid.  Do not waste a dime on this piece of crap.  I guess when they said fogless they meant San Francisco during the Santa Ana winds.</li>
    <li> This mirror does not fog up at all, and even the water beads off of it if you spray it just before use. I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> So happy with this mirror. It is the perfect size, nice and big, even for the 6&#x27;4 guys in the family. It has performed just as advertised. If it gets slightly steamed up right at the beginning of the shower, we just hold it under the water stream for a second and it works perfect, no fog. The company also seems on top of everything, following up with the order, giving tips, etc.</li>
    <li> I really liked this mirror. Never fogged up at all. It was very easy to mount to the wall and came with a razor hanger. I can even use it to apply make-up. The only downside is that it was a little small.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a mirror for the shower this one is for you. It works just like it is decribed it does not fog up at all, I love it.</li>
    <li> Installation was easy and simple. The product does as it claims. Overall, it&#x27;s a good product. I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> As far as shower mirrors go, this is a pretty good plastic alternative (for something that won&#x27;t break and shatter if dropped). I&#x27;ve used the mirror for shaving both in and out of the shower. I will say to be careful not to scratch the surface when cleaning it, but luckily the coating applied by the manufacturer pretty much makes all of the scratches and swirls disappear when the mirror is wet. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> Where has this been all my life?  I now spend upwards of 67 minutes in the shower, staring at myself.  It has made me late for work on numerous occasions.  Ironically this mirror has actually been influential in making me shave less because now I am able to stare at my gorgeous beard in the comfort of my own naked time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Nano-technology, fogless feature: I have no idea how this technology works, but they must hide the computer very well.  Somehow it prevents it from fogging. It may even be enchanted.&lt;br /&gt;- Easy installation: Tying my sneakers was more traumatizing than installing this mirror. This of course is no longer an issue since I now wear shoes with velcro fasteners.&lt;br /&gt;- Mounts:  Comes with a handy, secondary metal mount for my razor.  I have not installed it quite yet, but I can think of at least 11 different things to hang in my shower, including my tooth brush, a golf pencil, nunchucks, or a handy straw.&lt;br /&gt;- It hangs in such a way that when I walk into my bathroom, I can actually see it hanging in the shower.  It&#x27;s a very mystical experience... from 10 feet away, the image is somewhat distorted, but the closer I get the more detail it shows.  I feel almost as if I am called in by the sirens of my own vanity to see my reflection slowly clear-up until I snap out of it, looking around to see myself standing in the shower, fully clothed.  Sometimes I still have the car keys in my hand from walking in the door 2 hours prior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The seller (Cassani) keeps emailing me tips, tricks, and FAQs with subjects like &amp;#34;IMPORTANT: How To Protect &amp; Use Your Fogless Shower Mirror.&amp;#34;  Evidently mirrors that hang in showers are extremely complicated endeavors and have driven many men to insanity without proper guidance.  I appreciate their frequent emails that remind me how to use this advanced technology.&lt;br /&gt;- When I asked it, &amp;#34;Who is the fairest of them all?&amp;#34; it just kind of sits there.</li>
    <li> This product Works perfectly. No fog at all ever. I have owned it for about a month and I love it. The mirror is a Great size and very sturdy. Very pleased with purchase and company. It&#x27;s a great company because they have amazing customer service and care about the user experience. They checked in on me to make sure the product met my expectations. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror-A perfect Shave Every Time Review: Well I received one of these mirrors and put in my bathroom shower for my husband to shave while he showers, and I will have to say that it was wonderful my husband really loved it, he says he was able to to take a nice and hot shower and shave at the same time without having to clean the mirror off to see himself. The mirror is very light weight and practical and also comes with a hook to put your razor on witch my husband enjoyed because he didnt have to place the razor far from the mirror. So overall I would have to say that the Cassani Fogless Mirror has my vote and I really recommend anyone to get one, it&#x27;s not only useful it&#x27;s also very inexpensive you can get one on Amazon.com and look up Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror also if you are a Prime Member you can get it with free shipping.</li>
    <li> I have no complaints about this product. It works great. Only one thing of note though, it arrived with a slight concave in one spot towards the bottom and as a result my face disorts like a fun house mirror. This is easy to fix by just standing up straighter to see myself in the top portion of the mirror only. Ends up being a little humorous.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the mirror about a week, I love it! Shaving in the shower is a lot more fun and not as messy. No fogging so far which is a pleasant surprise.    Update (12/21/14): Mirror now fogs up, never used any chemicals or anything to clean it. Now while shaving I have to run it under the shower spray and then I can see for a bit. While I still enjoy shaving in the shower, it&#x27;s like all the others and eventually starts fogging up. I got it a few weeks ago and now it fog&#x27;s up. It was great while it lasted. Oh well, should have listened to to the other reviewers.</li>
    <li> I have tried approx five different shower mirrors and this one works well! It does stay clear. I will say that after about ten minutes, it does get a little less clear. I do take very hot showers and there is only a small window for ventilation. I quick run under the hot water is all it takes to clear it up. By then, anyway, I have already finished shaving so not a big deal. This mirror is much better than anything I have tried before. It is unbreakable, very lite, and comes with a convenient hook for my razor. I would definitely buy another if ever needed.</li>
    <li> The vendor has been extremely communicative regarding the product delivery and usage. But honestly, although I have placed it away from water splashes etc., the mirror gets foggy after 1 minute. It is not useful and I would unfortunately not recommend this product. Sorry.</li>
    <li> I just replaced my old suction-cup mirror with this Cassani mirror and I&#x27;ve been thrilled with the size, clarity, and secure mounting of the new mirror. It was very easy to install and performs absolutely as promised.</li>
    <li> Works as expected. I hung it up in my shower and use it to shave.  Not much else to say.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Perfect size, no fogging and crystal clear refection.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. No problem with adhesives, just followed the directions. I do not know what else to say. very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Okay ladies, how many of you hate the little whiskers that your hubbies leave behind on the sink after they shave? It drives me insane and no matter how much we both clean the sink, I&#x27;m constantly finding them. My hubby insists that he has to have a mirror to shave and when I suggested he get one for the shower to avoid hair in the sink where I brush my teeth (GROSS!), he informed me there&#x27;s no way it would work because it would fog up. Well, the problem solver that I am found this Fogless Shower Mirror. It was super easy to install. It came with two hooks, one to hang the mirror (which isn&#x27;t breakable) and one to hang your razor. They thought of it all! At first, my hubs was skeptical but after about a week of use and his wife much happier due to no more whisker on the sink, we were both fans!</li>
    <li> A shower mirror has been on my wishlist for years and I finally got the opportunity to try the Cassani fogless shower mirror! Although there&#x27;s a man on the cover of the box I think women can benefit from it in many ways too. Having a mirror in my shower now makes shaving facial hair and my nightly beauty routine so much easier. The steam in the shower opens your pores and softens your skin making for a closer shave. I use the mini facial razors from the dollar Japanese store which hang perfectly on the wall mount holder. No more red skin irritation from shaving on dry skin. I have a facial mask obsession and find the mirror convenient when thoroughly rinsing off my face. It will also come in handy when rinsing off hair dye. I can catch any spots I might have missed on my hairline or scalp. Usually I have to step out of the shower dripping water to check out my hairline. Having the mirror up in the shower opened up the space, making it visual and room like. The Cassani mirror was a cinch to put up. All there was to it was putting up the self-adhesive wall mounts and letting them set for a few hours. Easy peasy! The mirror has anti-fog nanotechnology so it never steams up. I can&#x27;t believe I went all these years without a mirror in my shower!</li>
    <li> About 3 months after using this, the mirror starts to fog up as soon as the shower is on. I&#x27;ve thrown away the mirror but kept the handy razor hook - hence the 2 stars that this product deserves.</li>
    <li> This worked well for about...2 weeks?  We followed the long list of do&#x27;s and don&#x27;t&#x27;s to keep it fogless, but it didn&#x27;t last long.  There is another mirror we found on Amazon that you fill with hot water to keep it from fogging and so far (1 month) it has been wonderful!  And the new mirror doesn&#x27;t have any chemicals!</li>
    <li> It does not stay fogless in the shower.  As soon as it gets wet it fogs up.  Of course it gets wet, because it is intended for the shower.  The mirror does not work as advertised</li>
    <li> This item simply works and looks good doing it. I previously had an Ace Fogless shower mirror which worked fairly good, but it doesn&#x27;t compare to the function, simplicity and elegance of this shower mirror.</li>
    <li> it is supposed to be a fogless shower mirror...Does not work as advertised. Definitely not fogless</li>
    <li> Very happy with the fogless mirror from Cassani! It does everything they say it will and that is rare in this day and time. I wear a goatee and it is tricky to shave around when you can&#x27;t see what your doing in the shower. Having a fogless mirror solves that completely! It actually cuts my &amp;#34;prep&amp;#34; time down a lot by being able to shave AND shower simultaneously. Love it.....thanks Cassani. Great product.</li>
    <li> This stays nice and clear ...until you turn the shower on. Then it fogs up like any other mirror.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working just fine for me.  We&#x27;ll see if it continues to do so.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to give a bad review since it seems like they try very hard to make this a good product, with clear instructions on how to use it.  Unfortunately, it actually fogs up more than any mirror I&#x27;ve ever owned!  It is almost like it is doing the opposite of what it is supposed to do, even after following all of the instructions (don&#x27;t put any chemicals on it, run water over it and wipe gently with palm of hand if it isn&#x27;t working properly, etc).  Maybe I got a dud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note, I tried contacting Cassani directly through the contact form on their website (http://www.cassanicompany.com), but haven&#x27;t heard back after several days so decided to go ahead and post this one publicly.  It seems like based on other reviews, that this product either works absolutely magically, or does the exact opposite.  Maybe there is some sort of QA issue?  In any case, mine doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Best shower mirror I have ever purchased!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. I have uses this mirror in the shower while washing my hair and it never once fog up on me. I can use this mirror when I can&#x27;t see in any of the other bathroom mirrors due to fog and can see myself very clear. This mirror fits perfect in the shower, not to big and it&#x27;s ability to stuck to the shower wall it awesome. I would recommend this product to anyone that is looking for a Fogless shower mirror.  I revived this product for free in exchange of review.</li>
    <li> This mirror is awesome. I love having it in the shower. It really is fogless and I love having my razor hanging up away from the little fingers. If you are in the market for a shower mirror - this is definitely the one to buy. The clarity of the mirror is wonderful. I actually use it to do my eyebrows while my skin is soft and moist. And it&#x27;s even helpful to see if I have all the shampoo out of my hair, and wash my makeup off my face! I would definitely recommend this mirror for anyone looking for some eyes in the shower :)</li>
    <li> Great product fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Good and simple. Plenty of viewing space.  Appears to be shatter resistant if not shatterproof.  There are no metal components to rust.  On previous shower mirrors, metal components have rusted after a period, and this will not be an issue with this mirror.  The reflection is clear and sharp, and no fog thus far (about three weeks of use).  I would buy these again and highly recommend them for anyone looking for a good and aesthetically pleasing shower mirror.</li>
    <li> It works great! My husband is very happy with it now that he can shave in the shower.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay fogless after a week the fog was on it</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product! It really is &amp;#34; FOGLESS MIRROR &amp;#34;  truly amazing! Very fast shipping, plus superior Customer Service from seller! Thank you.</li>
    <li> BEST SHOWER MIRROR I HAVE EVER HAD........SIMPLE BUT IT WORKS.  I&#x27;VE BEEN THRU MANY OVER THE YEARS.</li>
    <li> If had this product for about 4 months now and it is no longer working like it used to. It does not remain fogless. This started to occur around month 3. It worked great when I first purchased it, but now it is just as foggy as any other mirror</li>
    <li> Awesome mirror. Just as promised.    Update:  After about 2 months in my shower the fog-less feature stopped working gradually. Now it is a regular mirror, with only being useful because it hangs in the shower...</li>
    <li> Best fogless mirror I have ever bought. Adhesives work great, and always stays clear. Also Razor holder is very nice.</li>
    <li> Delivered quickly and in perfect condition.  Easy to install and works just like promised.  This is a great improvement over the previous kind I had.</li>
    <li> Works great! Fogless, great clarity, just the right size.</li>
    <li> Great little gadget. Still working after 2 months of use.</li>
    <li> It works as advertised. I don&#x27;t like the peel off sticky hooks. Better to use suction cups for use on mirrors.</li>
    <li> There is nothing more annoying than trying to shave in a foggy mirror and I was excited when I purchased the &amp;#34;HIGHEST RATED!&amp;#34; version of this category.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had high hopes based on all the 5 star reviews that this fog free mirror would be different than all the others I have used over the years, but now I realize that an amazon &amp;#34;HIGHEST RATED!&amp;#34; product doesn&#x27;t automatically mean I will get a great quality product. I wonder how anyone would not be disappointed with this product after using it for a few weeks and call into question most of the reviews. Maybe everyone is just trying to be nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works as advertised for about 3 weeks. The biggest problem with this mirror is that the coating and the face of the mirror is incredibly delicate. It scratches very easily and just the simple act of accidentally touching it with anything will leave tiny scratches. Once the scratches appear, the performance deteriorates rather quickly. After about week 3 it started to fog up and before I used it to shave, I would take it off the hook and just run it under the shower water for a few seconds and then I would get a few minutes of crisp clear fog free reflection. At about week 5 I had to repeat this process several times during the shave and the entire mirror would not be fog free, only a few patches.&lt;br /&gt;Now I am at week 6 of using this and what is happening now is that the water does not shed after I rinse it off, it just leaves little water drops all over it making using it nearly impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the directions that came with the mirror and the additional e-mail that was sent to me and I followed them exactly. I think that due to its fragility, even following the directions leaves no room for the accidental brush up with a wash cloth or inadvertent contact. I think that if you were as careful as the directions say with this mirror with any other fog free mirror, you would probably see the same performance out of a cheaper mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not all was bad, the shape and design of this mirror are great. I love that it hangs from a hook and is lightweight especially since I don&#x27;t have to worry about it breaking and hurting anyone if it falls off. Plus it is easy to remove in order to run under the shower to get rid of the fog. If I were to review this after the first day I used it, I would easily give it a 5. But I never review a product without putting it through some practical use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose that if you had a way to mount this in such a way where you could guarantee that you would never touch it, it might work better for you but it is just not practical to do that in a normal size shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, If you could reapply the anti-fog coating every 3-4 weeks then that would address this products shortcomings.</li>
    <li> The mirror fogs up after a month of use.</li>
    <li> UPDATED 11/17/2014: I reduced this to two stars after a few more weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before even receiving this mirror, I started receiving personalized e-mails from the manufacturer (Cassani).  So apparently there is a shower mirror company somewhere in China that now has my full name and e-mail address.  Thank you, Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this mirror because it was one of the highest-rated shower mirrors, but quickly found it did not live up to the rave reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My shower is a standard tub with a sliding-glass door, so it&#x27;s pretty well sealed up, other than a couple of feet of open space between the top of the door and the ceiling.  The instructions in the e-mail contained conflicting information:  \\&quot;By warming the mirror with the shower stream the difference in temperature between the shower air and the mirror disappears.\\&quot;  And then, a few sentences later: \\&quot;We recommend you placing your mirror away from areas in the direct shower stream.\\&quot;  OK, so I need the mirror to be warmed by the shower stream but it also needs to be be placed away from areas IN said shower stream!  Where should I put it - on the ceiling?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ignored the e-mail&#x27;s advice to do a \\&quot;test run\\&quot; before mounting the mirror permanently.  I&#x27;m not sure how I would test the mirror mounted in a different place, without actually mounting it!  The adhesive mounts provided are a one-shot deal.  I ended up mounting it on the far side of the shower, directly opposite the shower head.  That was the most convenient spot for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror itself looks like a shiny adhesive-backed piece of Contact paper mounted to a cheap plastic oval.  It is very lightweight.  The two metal clips are very thin-gauge, but seem strong enough for the light weight of the mirror and my razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly, the mirror&#x27;s optical quality is very good.  The image is undistorted, focused, and clear - in fact, it&#x27;s better than some rearview mirrors I&#x27;ve seen in cars.  I never realized how great I look in the shower!  Unfortunately, after about 30 seconds, my euphoria wore off as the mirror begun to develop ... you guessed it ... FOG!  Yes, it&#x27;s true - the highest-rated \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirror on Amazon fogs up like a Chevy Cavalier parked on Makeout Point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very simple to quickly rinse the mirror off to remove the fog, but if I wanted to do that, why would I buy a fogless mirror?  Anyway, it&#x27;s fogless condition only persists for about 30 seconds, so it&#x27;s a race between the fog and my razor.  If I ever sever my carotid artery because I&#x27;m trying to finish shaving before the mirror fogs over again, there&#x27;s going to be a lawsuit!  Just sayin&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, I also tried this mirror in my wife&#x27;s shower using a suction cup mount, and it did the same thing.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to matter where I put it - it fogs up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to sum up, my chief complaints are:&lt;br /&gt;1. This mirror does not live up to its main selling point.&lt;br /&gt;2. Why am I getting e-mails from the manufacturer?&lt;br /&gt;3. I would prefer suction-cup mounts rather than the semi-permanent adhesive provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The positives are:&lt;br /&gt;1. It was cheap.&lt;br /&gt;2. It seems like it will stay in good shape for a long time, despite its relatively inexpensive construction.&lt;br /&gt;3. Image quality is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect miracles from this thing.  You are better off just using any old mirror and rinsing it off while you shave, because that&#x27;s what you will end up doing with this one!about 30 seconds, my euphoria wore off as the mirror begun to develop ... you guessed it ...

    <li> Uncommonly, this company includes detailed instructions in multiple locations.  That&#x27;s a clue to the care with which the product is designed.  It installed quickly and works flawlessly.</li>
    <li> the mirror is great and the razor holder is convenient but the mirror definitely did fog &#x60;</li>
    <li> I bought two of these mirrors. I placed the first one above the sink and it seemed to be working fine. Since I liked the first one, I decided to buy another one to place in the shower. Soon after receiving the second one, I noticed scratches covering the first one. I followed the cleaning instructions to the letter - no cleaning products etc. I only cleaned it by running it briefly under water. Not long after, both mirrors started fogging up and I realized this &amp;#34;anti-fog nanotechnology&amp;#34; only works for a short period of time. I just checked their website since it&#x27;s advertised as &amp;#34;Hassle-Free 100% MoneyBack Guarantee if you are not fully satisfied&amp;#34; but their website is gone so I&#x27;m leaving this comment to help people avoid this product.</li>
    <li> This is the third mirror I have bought from Cassini. the first two I bought worked great but have to be replaced after 5 months or so. The last mirror I bought for some reason fogs up immediately . I have to constantly take it off the hook and run it thru the shower..pretty frustrating</li>
    <li> The mirror and razor hook both seem to be of decent quality. At first, the mirror was fog-resistant, but as many others have stated, that property wears off within months. I took the manufacturer&#x27;s advice on only gently cleaning the mirror with a soft cloth and water, but the fog resistance wore off over the course of a few months regardless.</li>
    <li> AAA+++. Great customer service!!</li>
    <li> Best fog less mirror I have had yet.  Very clear and great size as it is bigger than the last one I had.  Great bonus in getting the razor holder also!! Packaged very well to protect it during shipping and directions very clear for mounting.  Will definitely look for this item &amp; company again in the future.</li>
    <li> Have only used for a couple of weeks, but if it continues as it has so far, it will be great!  It is perfectly clear and a great size.  The clarity amazes me!!!!</li>
    <li> Just as advertised....I have been using it to shave in shower for a month....no fog at all.</li>
    <li> these last about a year before fogging up, so every year for my husbands birthday he gets a mirror.. but its great for the price!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fog, it comes with a hook to hang the mirror so you can either use it on the wall or handheld.  Bonus is the separate hanger for razors, it is big enough to hold two razors.</li>
    <li> Finally decided to get a mirror to shave in the shower. This one was recommended and I have not been dissappointed! Great product that does what is supposed to...not fog up!</li>
    <li> Fogs up you will have to wash it off than you can use it for a short period of time before it fogs up again, the only way I can see working if you take cold or warm showers.</li>
    <li> Completely fogless, for about three showers. Don&#x27;t believe the hundreds of 4 and 5 star reviews. They were probably paid for, believe me I know, I work in the web industry. The tell-tale sign is overly long and ridiculously praising essays written about a simple product. I followed the directions for installation and it failed to perform. Don&#x27;t buy this product. Look for something else.</li>
    <li> Fogs up every now and then... But so far so good.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I just take hotter showers than most people, but this mirror fogs up for me like any other mirror would. Luckily I don&#x27;t need to see with extreme precision to shave my neck, so I can wipe the fog and condensation away with my hand for long enough to do a couple quick swipes of my neck before the fog returns. The additional razor hook was a selling point for me, and I am happy with the size and shape of the mirror and hook, it&#x27;s just not as fogless as I hoped.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this and I do too. It lives up to its name without fogging up at all. It includes a hook for the mirror and your razor which is awesome. The hooks are easy to install in your shower. I love not having to clean up the sink now!</li>
    <li> When I was given the opportunity to review the Fogless Shower Mirror, I was super excited, I have seen my brother uses one at his home all the time. So we gave it a try to see in fact what all the hype was about. this mirror worked wonderfully, stayed attached with the suction cup provided and let me say it may fog up a bit, but all you need to do is put it under the water and simply the fog will be GONE! My husband uses this to shave while in the shower and we girls also use it to make sure we have cleared away all the make-up! the company has a wonderful team providing great customer service as well. You simply need to follow the directions, if it gets foggy run under water and fog will be gone and you will be good for the rest of your shower.</li>
    <li> This thing fogged up 3 times in the first 3 showers!  It is like buying a speaker that has no sound, glasses with out lenses(unless you&#x27;re a hipster doofus), shoes without soles, a phone that doesn&#x27;t make calls, a toothbrush with no bristles, a watch that can&#x27;t tell time, alcohol free beer... I think you get the point!  It was designed for one sole purpose and it failed miserably at it! This thing is the Hindenburg of fogless mirrors! This mirror is like the titanic and humidity is like the iceberg. The mirrors ability to stay fogless is only on par with the titanic&#x27;s ability to stay afloat. That being said it makes a great fogging shower mirror if that is what you are looking for and only came across listings for all these pesky &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirrors.</li>
    <li> This was very easy to install and so far has been working just great. Got this for my spouse to shave his head in the shower and he loves it. I think that it may stop working  after a while but as for now it is great.</li>
    <li> Very nice and safe mirror. Useful and looks good in our shower!</li>
    <li> Mirror works as intended mirror does fog up a little bit at first but as the directions state you should run it under the shower for a few seconds to warm it up. Any cold mirror or glass collects the warm condensation. The mounting although somewhat permanent is small enough to clean around. I like it its way better than my old suction cup mirror that continuously fogged up and fell off the wall in the middle of the night and startled me awake. Sometimes simpler is better.</li>
    <li> fantastic mirror, doesnt fog at all!</li>
    <li> I have never reviewed a product but since the company sent me an email asking for one, here you go.  I followed the directions, placed the mirror in the shower \\&quot;away from\\&quot; the water stream.  It has never been cleaned with anything, nor wiped off with anything.  I got maybe 3 or 4 showers with it before it started fogging up.    If I give it a quick rinse, I can use it.  But that&#x27;s not why I bought it in the first place.  It&#x27;s certainly not \\&quot;fogless\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Great product. Does what it says on the box!</li>
    <li> This is a superb product -- provided it keeps on working.  The design and simplicity of the mirror and the mounting hooks could hardly be improved upon, and the company is clearly devoted to customer satisfaction.  Looking at the reviews, the big question is whether the &amp;#34;foglessness&amp;#34; sustains.  If not, given the quality of the mirror and the good intentions of the manufacturer, I&#x27;ll be doubly disappointed.</li>
    <li> Simple, lightweight, easy to install.  Probably marked up quite a bit, but I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> What a piece of junk. Flimsy, plastic, etc... Arrived with a large scuff on surface of mirror. Fogs up like crazy!</li>
    <li> Bonds to almost any surface super easy.  Frameless mirror gives a clean, modern look and provides lots of surface area.  This thing also doesn&#x27;t seem to fog AT ALL...a great product</li>
    <li> I gave this to my husband and he really loves it! I also really appreciate the fact that it makes mornings easier as he is now not standing in front of the sink taking up space that I and others need to use to get ready as well. I will say at first he was skeptical, saying no way this is not gonna fog up in the hot shower but he was really impressed to see it does exactly what it says he uses it everyday!  Thinking of getting some as Christmas gifts</li>
    <li> This mirror is SO plain Jane.  It has a hole to hang on perhaps a shower caddy or do what my hubby does and prop it up on a shower caddy.  But he says it still fogs up.  He also says it better than nothing...  So gentleman, do with that information what you will.  I do not understand the top seller/highest rated/fogless claims....</li>
    <li> i dont normally write reviews but i really hated this item and it did not work at all</li>
    <li> Excellent product and does not fog ever.  Easy to hang on my tiled shower.  Razor hanger functions perfectly as well.</li>
    <li> This works well and has a nice, minimalist design.  We&#x27;ve had it for about three months and it remains fogless.  If it gets to the point that we need to rinse it to unfog it, it just hangs on a hook, so it will be an easy process.  I looked at the ones that require water to be poured into them, but that sounded like more work than just warming up the whole mirror under the water for five seconds.</li>
    <li> Works just like it says!</li>
    <li> Tried to wipe the mirror with a towel when it had water on it and the towel was hard enough to scratch the mirror up.  Shaver holder looks nice though and works well. Didn&#x27;t even last a year before being unable to use due to coatings developing on it and unable to clean them off</li>
    <li> Fantastic mirror! Easy to install, lives up to its claims, great for men and women.&lt;br /&gt;As a woman, I personally love using this mirror to help me take off all my makeup in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Simple, quality, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Simple yet effective.  Love the razor hanger too.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it claims:Fair price</li>
    <li> So I ordered this mirror a month ago.  And I was giving it time to see if it lived up to expectations.  And lo and behold..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;..it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first tip-off to the quality of this mirror was the fact that it used buzzwords: &amp;#34;nanotechnology&amp;#34;.  Words like that makes things sound all future-y and more advanced.  Ooh.  Aah.  Already it made me wary when I heard it being used for such an item, but the reviews seemed good enough, so I went for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After setting up the mirror, it was fog-free for a week and a half or so until I noticed it was starting to be..&#x27;hazy&#x27; in the steam, but not quite steamed up, and I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was my eyes or it was losing its anti-fog properties.  However, now, after about say 28 or 29 days later, it fogs up like any normal mirror, and I have to rinse it with water to get the steam off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And of course, the sheet of water over the glass protects it from further fogging for a bit.  So it&#x27;s basically like any other mirror at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next time you hear of a common- or pesudo-common household item using buzzwords, do indeed be wary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets two stars for being fog-free for a period of time.  Then it kaputs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do notice that water does sheet on the glass differently than it would on &#x27;normal&#x27; mirrors, I would think, so there is SOMETHING going on with it, but still, it ain&#x27;t workin&#x27; like it should.</li>
    <li> It works well and it&#x27;s inexpensive. What else could you want in a fogless mirror!</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I have Parkinson&#x27;s, and while the medication can help control some of the tremors they don&#x27;t necessarily stop them altogether. Tremors and balance problems are two issues I face daily, and being able to reduce the chances or falling is always a great thing. I know this probably sounds like an odd way to start this review, but those with Parkinson&#x27;s of similar problems will hopefully appreciate the approach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are quite a few fogless mirrors on the market, and I&#x27;ve used a half-dozen different forms of &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; over the years. I don&#x27;t think, though, that I&#x27;ve ever had one that was as good, and offered multiple solutions to my daily problems. Let&#x27;s start with the obvious issue, just how well does this product work to avoid fog. 100%. So far, in a couple weeks use, there has never been any fog on the mirror when I was ready to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the hot water first starts there will be fog. The physics of the shower is that the fog has to heat the mirror to an equal temperature to the surrounding air. Not steaming, per se, but close enough to the ambient temperature that the steam/fog simply won&#x27;t cling to the mirror. The trick, from what my friends in the science building tell me, is to use a surface that helps the mirror reach the ideal temperature in a reasonable amount of time. With this product that is achieved by the design (it&#x27;s really thin) and the material (I&#x27;m not sure what it&#x27;s made of, to be honest).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a more personal basis, the price to quality ratio is really good. You get the mirror, the hook, and then a separate hook for your razor. So you get to position it all in a place that is the most comfortable/convenient for you. In my case, and just over 6&#x27;1&amp;#34; I needed something I could easily attach fairly high on the shower wall. I attached the hook for the mirror and the shaver hook at approximately the same height. This helped to keep both the mirror and shaver on a level that reduced the chance of hitting it with my shoulder was nil. In the past, I&#x27;ve used mirrors that hooked to the actual nozzle plumbing and that meant, with a lower shower head, you had a mirror that was way to easy to bump with your shoulder. A little thing, but it really is worthwhile to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another somewhat unexpected advantage was the strength of the sticky stuff on the back of the hooks. I&#x27;ve used a variety of two sided &amp;#34;outdoor&amp;#34; tapes in the past to hook things to the shower wall (mostly mirrors, of course) and in almost every instance the sticky would simply become unsticky; leaving my mirror on the floor, usually at the worst time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the whole thing comes together by the super customer service I&#x27;ve received without even asking for it. Almost immediately after I received my product I got an email from the seller. The email was simply a followup to the sale, but the important part was the time they took to help provide instructions. These folks are truly interested in giving you not only a good product but also showing that they care about the sale, even after it&#x27;s made. In my case, I responded to tell them I&#x27;d just received the product and that I&#x27;d review it after I had a chance to use it. They were kind enough to thank me, offer to help if I needed anything else. They even &amp;#34;reminded me&amp;#34; to clean the foggless mirror just like I would my favorite sunglasses. I thought was a good tip and really appreciate the fact they were making it so easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IN short, I&#x27;d not only recommend this product to a friend, I&#x27;m going to include it on my Christmas list for several of my male friends. I&#x27;d give it to female friends, too, but I&#x27;m not that politically correct. I just can&#x27;t see any of my women friends holding their calf six-foot in the air to get a good shave.e chance of hitting it with my shoulder was nil.

    <li> Great product, I&#x27;ve always loved shaving in shower and was just happy with other mirrors.&lt;br /&gt;This one well exceeds others I&#x27;ve bought!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for great product. Materials are well made</li>
    <li> Like many stated, this is great at first.  For me, that period of time was maybe 6-8 weeks.  Now it fogs up and gets water drops all over it.  I won&#x27;t fault this product or company specifically, because EVERY shower mirror I&#x27;ve ever bought (and there have been a few) do this.  Even all the &amp;#34;fog free&amp;#34; ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short...followed all directions and it still gives up the ability to stay clear in the shower after enough time.  Maybe its just physics and unavoidable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My fix is to splash water on it constantly, or smear a bit of soap on it and you&#x27;ll get a couple minutes of fairly clear use out of it.  If the mirror stayed fog/water free for even half a year or so, I&#x27;d give it 4 stars...but not even 2-3 months is still leaving a lot to be desired.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mirror for a week.  No fogging and the hooks haven&#x27;t gone anywhere.  (Prior to adhering the hooks, I cleaned the area with shower cleaner and rinsed it well;  then I cleaned it with rubbing alcohol and let it dry;  I applied the hooks per the instructions and left them alone for 8 hours, then put the mirror on.)  So far I&#x27;m enjoying having this mirror in my shower.</li>
    <li> This mirror just works. It&#x27;s easy to install, easy to use, looks great. Unlike previous mirrors I have used that have had many challenges. I really love the no-frame feature.</li>
    <li> it is perfect  could not ask for a better fogless shower mirror  and i have had many</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great because it&#x27;s easy to remove and use as a hand mirror as well. Perfect size and fog free as advertised.</li>
    <li> Fog less for a same time and yes I followed instructions</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror and used it for a few days, and it worked great.&lt;br /&gt;Then, my housekeeper cleaned it with a standard glass cleaning product, and the mirror was ruined (I did not know that you should NOT clean it with anything but soap or tooth paste...)&lt;br /&gt;At the following day, the seller sent me a &amp;#34;thank your order&amp;#34; email, with some instructions about how to clean it. I replied to him, saying that these instructions were not clearly marked on the box, and next time I suggest that this email will be sent before you get the product.&lt;br /&gt;The seller sent me a new mirror, without even me asking for it!!&lt;br /&gt;And he promised that from now on, these instructions will be added to the order confirmation email (or in a separate email, but before you get the mirror).&lt;br /&gt;A customer service at its best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the product is great, as I already mentioned...</li>
    <li> Picture an oval mirror hanging in space. It has no frame whatsoever which is good. I ditched my last mirror because the plastic frame was loaded with soap scum that I could not get off, making it less than elegant.&lt;br /&gt;This mirror is fog-less even when I don&#x27;t bother running warm water over it.&lt;br /&gt;Watch out when applying the adhesive for the hanging hook, It practically pulls itself in once you touch one edge to the shower wall. You only get one try. Mine is off level a bit but hardly noticeable. I recommend that you tape a ruler to the shower wall and use that to guide your hook placement.</li>
    <li> Seriously, mirror works fine, doesn&#x27;t fog up, helps me be more efficient by shaving in the shower. I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Outstanding, does a great job of staying fogless.</li>
    <li> I have had this for 4 months now and it fogs up non stop and the glue on the clip just fell apart. Just like any mirror I had to put soap on the mirror to get rid of the fog. Do not waste your money. I have no idea why it has good reviews</li>
    <li> The mirror was great when we just received it, no distortion, clear, no fog, lightweight, good size, just perfect. But it has scratches all over (from top to bottom, from one side to another) just after a couple weeks of use. We do not scrub it, husband said he used his washcloth to wipe it off (manufacturer&#x27;s response - washcloth is abrasive..). It&#x27;s still usable though. I am not sure I would order again at this price.</li>
    <li> Fogless mirror? Yea ok maybe when it&#x27;s still in the box and unused. It fogs up after 30 seconds. Don&#x27;t believe all the &amp;#34;good reviews&amp;#34; on here. It&#x27;s garbage and a waste of money. And also the adhesive must&#x27;ve been made on the planet Krypton because it look me over an hour to get it off my new bathroom shower tiles. I want a refund!</li>
    <li> After a couple of weeks of use, the backing is coming off. But more importantly, this mirror is not fogless. It fogs up within 45 seconds, even after rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what it&#x27;s worth, customer service was really polite. But they told me to try washing the mirror in vinegar, wiping with my hands, etc. Pretty sure the problem can&#x27;t be solved by doing any of those things - it&#x27;s just not a fogless mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ended up getting a refund.</li>
    <li> I really liked this mirror at first - it seemed like such a good (though spartan) design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after a few months, it&#x27;s developed a cloudy haze that just won&#x27;t clean off:  I&#x27;ve tried everything, even toothpaste, but it almost seems as if the surface of the mirror has changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to throw it away,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical at first that this mirror could be FOG FREE, but i have used it multiple times &amp; it has proved to be fogless 100% of the time! this mirror is very handy and you can hang it wherever in your shower that is most convenient for you! it even comes with a hanger for your razor! this is the best mirror i&#x27;ve ever owned and would recommend it to everyone!!</li>
    <li> The mirror arrived when Amazon said it would. The Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror is a great one to have. The product name is &amp;#34;fogless shower mirror&amp;#34; and it does just that! It stays clear during my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The holder for the razor is very useful also. It&#x27;s out of my 2 year old&#x27;s reach, and it&#x27;s always where I can find it when I need it. My razor fits the holder perfectly so I don&#x27;t have to worry about my razor falling all the time. Again I mention . . . I like that it&#x27;s kept out of my 2 year olds reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To install the fogless shower mirror is very simple and I imagine most showers, if not all, would be able to have the Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror installed. This is due to the fact that it doesn&#x27;t use suction cups to stick to your shower wall. Instead, it uses adhesive wall mounts and stays where I placed it. I don&#x27;t have to fight it to stay on the wall, I only ever had to install it once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product for free in exchange for a review.</li>
    <li> This mirror was amazing! I am always shaving in the shower and need a mirror for my lady parts and this worked great haha. Also, the Hubby likes to shave in there as well so it saves him a lot of time in the mornings :) No fogging up, a perfect mirror!</li>
    <li> The Fogless Shower Mirror works really well! The only thing I can see might be an issue is if your shower has any type of texture to it then it would be harder for it to stick. The mirror works just as directed, it does not fog! The razor holder is a mega bonus! I did receive this product for a review and did not purchase. Over all- I recommend this if you are looking for a cool holiday stocking stuffer for your guy.</li>
    <li> YES, the finish on the mirror is very slick and prevents the water from spotting up.&lt;br /&gt;Cannot give a full review yet since I&#x27;ve only had the mirror 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;In those two weeks the finish has not washed off, and I do put a lot of water on it.&lt;br /&gt;I use a suction cup I purchased elsewhere on Amazon, and it works fine.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t like the permanent &#x27;glue&#x27; type fastener they provided.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed - (until the slick finish wears off, if it ever does...)</li>
    <li> Have been using the mirror for a couple of months now, and I am very impressed with it.  No spots or streaks so far.  I rinse it off after shaving to remove any soap residue that might be on it, and it still looks like new after drying.  i scraped the foam tape off of the supplied hooks and installed it with 3M Command (TM)  tape in case I want to move or remove them latter.  I plan to buy the travel size one for a trip to Peru this fall.</li>
    <li> This is such a cheap way to improve your morning routine.  The adhesive works well and the mirror is just the right size (it might seem small but it&#x27;s quite sufficient).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you run the shower very hot, the mirror will fog up at first.  Just take it off the hook, run it under the water for just a second and it will heat right up and not fog up for the rest of the shower.</li>
    <li> This product was just what I was looking for.  High quality, clear view for shaving, plus it is lightweight and easy to pull of the hook if needed, unlike the suction cup models that tend to break over time.  The reflectivity and clarity is great, far better than any other fogless mirror that I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> Bought this mirror about 2 months ago. I based my purchase decision primarily on the favorable reviews. Boy, was that a mistake. The mirror fogs up within seconds and the water spots are so bad, you can barely see a thing. I fond myself constantly wiping the fog and water spots away, while trying to shave. The company that sells this mirror professes to be customer service oriented, but I call their bluff. It&#x27;s imply not true. This must be a case of ballot box stuffing where the company has hired people to write favorable reviews of their product. Don&#x27;t believe the favorable reviews. Maybe the product was worthy in the past, but it is no longer.</li>
    <li> Finally a mirror that works. I have used a lot of different mirrors to shave in the shower. This one really works. Would highly recommend it</li>
    <li> This mirror works better then any other I have used. It&#x27;s really makes a difference shaving in the shower and is almost painless due to the steam and moisture. I have used several other mirror and this one works flawlessly. I normally have to wipe the mirrors over and over but never with this one. No steaming up along the edges ether. Unlike most fog less mirror this one does the job the way it should. Even the sticky pads that hold them om</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for Father&#x27;s Day and he loves it.  He&#x27;s always said its more convenient to shave in the shower than at the sink but he never took the time to find a fogless mirror for the shower.  He&#x27;s complimented it each time he&#x27;s used it.</li>
    <li> Love the way it hangs but it fogs up all the time</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Works great In the shower - doesn&#x27;t fog up at all!</li>
    <li> Bought this product three months ago. Everything was great. About two weeks ago, small white spots started to appear on the mirror. Now, most of the mirror has rough white markings on it that make it hard to use, especially when wet. Now it&#x27;s unusable.</li>
    <li> This mirror is great...warmed it with the hot water and it remained fog free for the rest of my shower.&lt;br /&gt;Nice size and very clear image.  Very light weight so no fear of it falling down.  Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I was tired of seeing hubby carry a hand mirror to the bathroom whenever he is going to shave his head. I decided to look on Amazon and see what they had to offer for shower mirrors. I read the reviews and decided to give it a try! My hubby is very particular in his choice of stuff. Well, before I could ask how the mirror is he said: &amp;#34;Sure this mirror is a nice surprise!&amp;#34; I asked how and he said he doesn&#x27;t have to carry the hand mirror as he gets a clear view as he shaves his head and it is fogless! Installation was a breeze. He didn&#x27;t have to attach the razor hook as he doesn&#x27;t need it. Thanks Cassani, Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have shaved in the shower for 35 years and have probably used 15 or 20 different mirrors. Some did the job pretty well...others didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best...period!</li>
    <li> there is nothing special about the design of this, there is nothing fancy about the looks. But this mirror truly works and stays cleaner and clear than any other mirror i have used in the shower.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a replacement shower mirror after the suction-cup version I had been using gave up on me after about 2 years of use.  The suction cups simply don&#x27;t last forever.  When I received this new &amp;#34;Fogless Shower Mirror&amp;#34; I was shocked at how cheap it seemed - it is scarcely thicker than a piece of paper.  Rather than suction cups, it uses adhesive panels (one for the mirror and one for the razor holder).  I am skeptical of adhesive products used in the shower because they seldom hold up - even when applied properly.  The razor holder gave up in about 5 days (must have been under-engineered as it was only supporting a featherweight disposable razor on the hook).  The mirror has so far remained in place - but then again, it is about as thin as a sheet of paper so I suppose scotch tape would have held up as well.  Four weeks into it so far and the mirror is not so &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; anymore.  Since nearly anything of this nature we purchase now comes from China where production costs are next to nothing and transportation costs are more significant, distributors are looking for cheaper and lighter materials to use.  Bottom line, this product isn&#x27;t awful, it would be a good &amp;#34;value&amp;#34; at about $1.99 at a dollar store - if you buy this, you should consider it a disposable item.  This is a real review from a real customer who actually purchased the product .</li>
    <li> Good quality, not a barn burner, a bit flimsy.  Seems that the press tape is holding fine, it&#x27;s only been a month, so we&#x27;ll see in a year.</li>
    <li> This mirror has worked better than I expected. It has not fogged once since I&#x27;ve had it! I wish my main bathroom mirror was coated with this stuff!</li>
    <li> Original five-star review, written after owning the mirror for only a few days: I really couldn&#x27;t be happier with this mirror. It&#x27;s so much better than anything I&#x27;ve tried before. The anti-fog coating is awesome and the size is perfect. Absolutely 100% recommended to anyone shopping for a shower mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated one-star review, after many months of use: Thanks to to the seller&#x27;s terrific customer service (sincerely!), I&#x27;m on my second mirror in a year, and I can say without reservation that the anti-fox coating simply does not last.</li>
    <li> Works great for me.  No batteries or power, hit the front and back with the shower stream for a second, hang it back up, and I can see plenty clear without even wiping it off.  Wish I had never spent years trying to use the plastic stick-on mirror type.  It even seems to magnify slightly.</li>
    <li> Stopped working after a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Are you kidding me? I used it once without fog and ever since then, it gets foggy all the time. In fact, every time I shower and shave, I have to take this off the wall and run it under the water to clear the fog. I was better off sticking with the usual one I buy from Target - at least that one starts to fog after a good six months. This was a waste.</li>
    <li> Great simple product that works way better than any of the fancier models. Also excellent proactive communication from the supplier. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Stop looking and buy this mirror. No filling reservoirs with water like others. It&#x27;s light, mounts quickly, allows you to see your entire face while shaving and comes with a razor hook. Didn&#x27;t know a plastic mirror could look just as sharp as a glass one but it does. Perfect. Don&#x27;t waste your money on any other more expensive, clumsy mirrors.</li>
    <li> This product got worse with time.  It fogged up right away and was difficult to keep clear from the day I started using it. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> quite small with small plastic mounting pieces.</li>
    <li> This product is terrible. I bought this back in December and the mirror ALWAYS fogs up.</li>
    <li> Long story short, it doesn&#x27;t work. Fogs up and is constantly covered in beads of water, so it&#x27;s hard to use. Completely defeats the purpose. One of the worst purchases I&#x27;ve ever made on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This mirror is great to have in the shower! The reason I gave three stars is not the fault of the manufacturer, but my husband accidentally wiped the mirror with his towel after the first use (he was unaware of how to take care of the mirror), so I haven&#x27;t been able to know how well the fogless feature works. So far we do not have any water marks (and it no longer gets wiped off with a towel.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of so-called &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; showers and none of them worked as advertised.  They fogged, the fell down, etc....  This fogless shower mirror was by far the easiest to install and is the clearest mirror I&#x27;ve ever had in the shower.  And NO Fog!!!</li>
    <li> This fog free shower mirror works great.  Easy to install and use.  The Cassani Company does a fantastic job of following up to ensure customer satisfaction and to ensure that the customer is fully aware of how to properly care for their product.</li>
    <li> Easy to install the mirror &amp; razor hook. Nice compact design. So far it has not worked as well as I had hoped. It works better than my old one, but I&#x27;m still getting annoying fog to appear. Rinsing it helps some, but then there are water droplets to look thru. I&#x27;ll try cleaning it &amp; then see how it works. Maybe scuba mask cleaner will help.</li>
    <li> Easy installation.  Superior clarity compared to my old shower mirror.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great, just remember to rinse it when it does eventually fog up... Then, it&#x27;s right back to being a perfectly useful mirror!</li>
    <li> Good for a few months, then it&#x27;s foggier than a regular mirror.</li>
    <li> I will start off by saying that I enjoy this mirror, it is easy to hang, and is very useful in the shower. I shave my face in the shower and this has proved useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint, though, is that this mirror is not fogless. Right out of the box I setup the mirror in my shower, followed the included instructions, have *never* used any cleaning products on it of any kind (nor any cloths), it is not in the stream of water from the shower (nor getting splashed), and yet it still fogs up (even on the first use). I have seen other complaints of the mirror fogging up and it is very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone from the company wanted to reach out to me on this, please feel free.</li>
    <li> For the price paid, I think this is the best mirror yet! I have only had it for a few weeks which is why I haven&#x27;t given it five stars. I placed it on the far end of the shower and leave the curtain open a little and it hasn&#x27;t had any fog whatsoever on it. It is very easy to take on and off the hook for travel but you wouldn&#x27;t be able to hang it unless you tied a rope to it. The hanger is meant to stay on your shower. I would rather it be like this so the mirror doesn&#x27;t fall- suction cups don&#x27;t work. I am very pleased with this purchase and definitely would buy again or buy for a gift!</li>
    <li> It works really well. I have zero idea how it works. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas.  I was super excited because of some of the reviews that I read.  Seemed like a good product and a great price.  We got the mirror, hung it up and it&#x27;s FOG CITY!  You can&#x27;t even see out of the thing.  Worst product ever!  It was like this right from the start.  I can&#x27;t even say one good thing about this product.  I am very disappointed and hopefully will be able to return it, even though we have already thrown out the box.  Here is a picture of this &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; product.  Don&#x27;t waste your time buying this.  Says Highest Rated!  I would say it&#x27;s the Highest Rated as being the WORST!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t even last 1 month before the mirror began to fog up. Have done nothing besides let it hang in the shower and it doesn&#x27;t function as advertised. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> The fogless mirror worked for about 2-3 days, then fogs up immediately like a normal mirror. No cleaning products or anything was used on it. Would not recommend!</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I was skeptical but I&#x27;m one who must shave in the shower and after having two other models and being unhappy, I&#x27;m finally VERY happy. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this as replacement for another brand of fogless mirror my husband was using. The one he had didn&#x27;t work well at all. He said this one is great! We definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Item is as described.</li>
    <li> The mirror is perfect! I use it to shave in the shower and it truly works! It&#x27;s the perfect size and takes up very little space.</li>
    <li> This mirror does not work as advertised.  I contacted customer service after the first mirror fogged up and they were great in sending a replacement.  Unfortunately the second mirror fogged up within a few minutes of showering.</li>
    <li> It has never fogged up on me in the shower.  I use it everyday with no problem.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I broke my previous shaving mirror and decided to buy this based on the reviews.  It is simple and effective with no fogging so far at all.  It is also so light that I doubt it would even break if dropped.</li>
    <li> Great fogless mirror. Does just what the ad states. Haven&#x27;t had an issue with fogging at all, evenin very hot water...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great u can see very well . No foging and very clear ,by far the shower-&#x27;mirror I have had ....and u can&#x27;t beat the price ....</li>
    <li> I love this mirror.  It truly is fogless and is a very nice size that allows me to see my entire face and neck area.  The parts are well made and the mirror is shatterproof.  Great for home or travel.  Easy to use and mount.</li>
    <li> Good product, I recommend it. You can place it basically anywhere in the shower easily.</li>
    <li> Usable but not fog less</li>
    <li> Was &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; for about a month.  Now it fogs instantly and has to be rinsed at least three times during a normal shave in the shower.  I have never cleaned it with other than water, as advised.</li>
    <li> Fogless for one week. Then failed immediately. It&#x27;s nice and lightweight so I can rinse under water and clear but this is anything but fogless. Fail.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Living in humid Florida, this is the 1st shower mirror I have owned that actually is Fog-less. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The first one I bought lasted about 6 months which was far better than the competition. The second and its replacement you sent me lasted a week or so and they get really foggy you can hardly see anything Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I buy a fair amount of items on Amazon. They always do a good job! But this was shipped first from this Cassani company and let me tell you... unless they have a rogue employee who&#x27;s trying to make the company sink, they are not trustworthy! The mirror arrived USED, and I mean BADLY USED, with scratches, water marks, even a hook still with the glue attached!!! ...and, you figured it... no included glue as promised!  You don&#x27;t want to deal with a company like this!  I&#x27;m attaching photos. Notice even the back covering was peeled away and torn!  11/10/2014 Update: I had attached 2 photos, but they are no longer here. And I see no way to add them!</li>
    <li> Great product, works perfectly as stated. When I buy a product from Amazon first I look at how many five stars, then I read the few complainers reports. You can get a feel for how credible the complaints are. There is nothing wrong with this product. If you pay attention to the instructions, use a little common sense and care, you will have no problems with this mirror. The company stands behind it 100%. A little rinse under the shower is all you need, the coating on the surface takes care of it. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with the mirror.</li>
    <li> Great product very satisfied with my puchase.</li>
    <li> We have had a “fogless” mirror in our bathroom for years, and I honestly felt that fogless was a myth.  It never failed, each time someone would take a shower you still had to wipe down the mirror of the fog prior to use. Well, it was time to replace our mirror so I decided to try the Cassini fogless shower mirror, I am glad I did!! We take those lobster red type showers, so it seems everything fogs. But this mirror didn’t have a spot of fog. I am impressed!! Now the hubby can shave, and I can easily see to get all my facial primping done. Thanks Cassani for a product that actually works!!</li>
    <li> is not fogless, very disappointed</li>
    <li> I find myself very happy with my fog less mirror and so do my husband. When I first seen it I was like yeah right a fogless mirror, I just knew I was going to be wiping and leaving be hide ugly water stains. And the mirror will be wet making it hard to see. I was very Happy that I was WRONG abut it. Works super great and will be happy to buy one as a gift for my sister. Now if they can only come out with glasses I can wear in the shower. :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a mirror. Not much to say about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions to the letter—no cleaning products were ever used, and I hung it out of the direct stream of water. I&#x27;ve had this for about about a month, and it&#x27;s starting to fog up seconds after I start the shower. This means it&#x27;s no different from a normal shower mirror at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, some extra mounting tabs for the hooks would have been nice, but this is just nitpicking. It&#x27;s not a bad product, but it&#x27;s not fogless.</li>
    <li> Works as described! Awesome mirror that is great for shaving in the shower.</li>
    <li> Helps my shaving; now I can see myself shaving.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fog up!  Great mirror</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do. The instructions about the backing could be clearer, but that&#x27;s a minor issue that doesn&#x27;t really impact the mirror&#x27;s usefulness.</li>
    <li> I bought this a couple of weeks ago for my husband and he&#x27;s  blown away by how great it works compared to the last one he bought from a different vendor. I will be ordering more of these as gifts for relatives in the future. You can take a super hot shower and shave with no fog. And the customer service couldn&#x27;t be better. They gave me an email before I got it explaining how to install so I&#x27;ll have little to know trouble. I would give them 10 stars if I could.</li>
    <li> Exactly what we were looking for! This mirror is light and installs very easily anywhere in the shower. No fogging at all - it&#x27;s great!  :)</li>
    <li> This mirror looks sleek and really does work, as long as you follow the cleaning instructions to a T.  It&#x27;s hard to keep errant shower spray from always hitting it but just let it air dry.  Do not wipe it down with you fingers or a cloth.  Mine worked great until I started to try and get the little water drops off it and then it started fogging up.  I think if you just let it be and make sure it&#x27;s as far away from shower spray you&#x27;ll be very happy!  I really do like it and have a replacement one coming.</li>
    <li> So, helpful to see what I am doing when I wash my hair. It hasn&#x27;t fogged up on me to the point where I can&#x27;t see anything, and I tend to take hot showers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this mirror for about a week now and it&#x27;s great and much better than the one I had before that requred hot water.</li>
    <li> I recently received a free Fogless Shower Mirror by Cassani to review.  It arrived in a bag with a protective film on the mirror to prevent it from getting scratched during shipping.  The mirror was very clear and defined.  It came with a wall mount for the mirror as well as a mount for a razor.  They were easy to apply since I just had to peel and stick.  I actually placed this mirror next to my bathtub because I take a lot of baths.  I often wish I had a mirror next to the tub so I could tweeze my eyebrows or remove eye makeup.  I can even relax in the tub now with a facial mask on and I will be able to see if it is dry without getting up to check.  It&#x27;s so handy to have right there!  I can see why they would be nice as a shower mirror because it doesn&#x27;t fog up.  I would definitely recommend the Fogless Shower Mirror by Cassani to anyone who wants a mirror in their shower or tub.</li>
    <li> Even when my bathroom is foggier than London at midnight, I can see my mug clearly enough to shave. great product. One thing when you receive it. it has a clear invisible protective sheet and a sticker on top of that. The 1st time I used it, I removed the sticker, but thought that was the protective sheet. Once the mirror got wet, I peeled the clear sheet off. It was amazing.</li>
    <li> It was really great - for the first two weeks. Then, gradually, it lost its anti-fogging ability (it won&#x27;t shatter because it&#x27;s mirrored plastic). Now, I use it as a mount for a small magnifying mirror with suction cups, which works well for me because I need reading glasses to safely shave.  On the plus side, the included minimalist stainless steel razor holder is attractive and practical. I would buy the razor holder by itself.</li>
    <li> My fiance has been looking at shower mirrors for quite some time now.  They&#x27;ve either been too bulky or too small or just plain impractical.  Then I came across this fogless shower mirror, it is absolutely amazing.  My fiance loves very hot showers, so our bathroom gets pretty steamy, surprisingly the Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror really does stay fogless!  Because he&#x27;s also able to shave in the shower, the steam moistens his skin, opens his pores and gives him a nice close shave.  The razor holder is also quite handy, keeping your shaver clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s absolutely nothing bad I can say about this mirror, it&#x27;s absolutely fantastic!  A couple of recommendations though, be sure to hang it of of the shower spray and never ever clean it with window/glass cleaner.  They recommend soap and water or toothpaste.  Harsh chemicals will remove the fogless technology.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Will allow my man to shave in the shower, and will let my brush my teeth as well. It is going to be fun for the toddler as well since it is not breakable like regular mirrors. Fast shipping, reasonable packaging. Great product for our bath!</li>
    <li> Stays clear, no matter what! I get a much closer shave in the shower, now that I can see what I am doing.</li>
    <li> Very, very good. Bought two and been using it for more than a month now.</li>
    <li> Not sure what it will look like when I remove it and the adhesive, but it works well and no more falling down and marking the tile.  Had it up for a couple months now and still works great.  I just wipe it with my hand.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Fogs up when I shower but I just run my hand over it and remove the clouding.  I would not call it fogless by any means, but it still is a nice little mirror for my morning shower and shave.</li>
    <li> still fogs up but its really helpful in the bathroom</li>
    <li> Not really fogless, but it does the job. I do find I have to splash water on it every few minutes which the instructions state may be needed. The manufacture needs to rename this product more appropriately, maybe something more like &amp;#34;Fog Inhibiting/Reduction Mirror.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Eventually got the mirror..... I must say that it took so long to get here that it would put me off ordering again...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Installed and working a treat...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.....&lt;br /&gt;Happy Man In Shower!</li>
    <li> This mirror is grate does what it says does not fog I rate it a10 so if you need one it is the best.</li>
    <li> I love having a mirror in the shower. We had a another one for a while but you had to fill it with hot water to keep it fog free and that was a little of a pain. With this mirror you don’t have to do a thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest the mirror itself seemed a little cheap when I took it out of the box because the ‘mirror’ part seemed like it wouldn’t last very long. Although I have been pleasantly surprised on how well it looks like a real mirror and it seems really durable after using it for a while. The reason I was worried was because it isn’t really glass it is made of some kind of plastic with a brown backing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it isn’t glass it is very light so I didn’t have to worry about it being too heavy and falling. It comes with two metal hooks, one for the mirror and one for your razor. The hooks are very easy to apply. They come with a sticky back which you can apply to a flat surface by simply applying pressure for 45 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor holder is a nice bonus. Since it is a hook style you don’t have to worry about your razor going anywhere. The hooks have held up very nicely also, they haven’t budged at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror hasn’t fogged up on me at all. If it get wet the water just falls away and the mirror is back to normal when dry. You aren’t supposed to use any cleaners on it at all because this can ruin the mirror, instead if you need to clean the mirror they suggest just using water or a little vinegar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, $14.99, it is a great buy and looks like you paid a lot more.</li>
    <li> I have tried other mirrors and most fog at some point.  Have been using this for a month with no issues.</li>
    <li> No complaints here...bought it for my husband, he loves it.  That just about sums it up, but apparently I need to write a longer review.  :)</li>
    <li> the title of my review says it all. I was extremely pleased with the look and ease of installation of this fogless mirror, and it even remained fogless for the first 2 days. It was downhill after that. Even with constant wiping, it still fogs over in a matter of seconds, making shaving darn near impossible. I&#x27;m on the lookout for something better already. This product was a huge disappointment.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent fogless shower mirror as it truly lives up to its name - FOGLESS.  I&#x27;ve been through several mirrors for shaving in the past, but this is the best I&#x27;ve had so far simply because no fog forms and leaves a clear crisp viewing surface.</li>
    <li> This mirror works just like it says it does, if does not fog up, you can see to shave, and do not have to constantly clean it</li>
    <li> I absolutely love that everything is stainless steel, including the wall mount and the razor holder mount. Installation was a breeze too!My husband loves this mirror! Not only does it stay fog free during his hot showers, but it&#x27;s extremely lightweight. He can take it off the mount and easily hold it while shaving the back of his head. It&#x27;s the perfect size for use in the shower and also compact enough that it&#x27;s easy to pack for traveling. My husband has been using this mirror for almost 2 weeks and couldn&#x27;t be happier. I honestly have to say, this is the first Fogless Shower Mirror that we have ever used that actually worked like it says. The Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror  is definitely worth investing in whether for yourself, your husband or as a gift.</li>
    <li> I gave this to a friend as a gift.  After reading many reviews I decided to get the mirror and it works great.  I don&#x27;t use it since it was given as a gift but from what he tells me, he uses it to shave in the shower and it works great.</li>
    <li> Works great. Doesn&#x27;t fog. The reflection is sharp and clear. I would buy it again. The adhesive works better than the usual suction cups.</li>
    <li> It worked well in the beginning. A month later it was like the anti-fog layer had simply dissipated and now it fogs up just from breathing closely to the mirror.</li>
    <li> I have tried plenty and this is a fogless mirror that truly stays fogless.  Make sure to follow the very simple instructions: basically don&#x27;t clean the mirror with anything other than regular bath soap; if it starts to get a little foggy (and it will!) just put it in the shower water for about 5 seconds and you&#x27;re fogless again. I have got in the habit of just taking it down from the hook and rinsing it in shower water before I shave.  It will stay very clear for the rest of your shower. It works so well I have purchased a few as presents for some of my buddies who also shave in the shower.  This is the real deal at by far the lowest price.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe people gave this product high ratings.</li>
    <li> Works great, a shave in the shower can&#x27;t be beat</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift and my friend loves it.</li>
    <li> An excellent shower mirror.  It does not fog up.  It is absolutely clear.  I had a previous mirror that was always fogged up, no matter what I did to prevent it.  Very pleased with this mirror.  Easy to mount an can be taken off the hook with ease, but you probably will not have to do that.</li>
    <li> fogs up like any other. worthless</li>
    <li> Works exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been on the lookout for a mirror that I can place in my shower that I don&#x27;t have to constantly wipe away the fog. Loved this one the minute I placed it in my shower. It also comes with a little hanger that you can place your razor on right next to it. It&#x27;s very durable so I will definitely be traveling with it and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Great product!  It truly is fogless! I am ordering a second one! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> If it fogs just let it dry.  Then take a tiny amount of dish soap, like Dawn, and smear it to cover the mirror.  Set aside for couple of hours.  Then take a paper towel and buff the soap off, only enough to see yourself clearly in it.  Rehang in the shower and voila, no more fog.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Better than all other shower mirrors I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product.  I was skeptical but it works very well.  It was shipped promptly and securely.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is an interesting product. It is a mirror like surface, it is not a great detailed mirror. It is enough to see to shave with. It comes with its own hook that mounts to a shower wall surface. I did not do this option, did not want to take the chance to mess up my shower wall. I did however use the hole that it comes with and hang it from the shower head. Next the fogless part of this. It is fogless for the most part. Some of what I do is to test things. So I took and cranked the hot water on full for 15 minutes. I only had one spot that fogged up, was about a 1 in. by 2 in. patch, but again this was at full hot water. On a normal showering I never seen any part of it fog up. It comes with cleaning and care instructions, only use water and a soft cloth to clean it, or it may lose the fogless ability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The other things worth mentioning, it comes with a razor holder that sticks to the wall like the mirror mount. Upon opening the package and removing the mirror. I noticed many little scratches on my mirror surface. I do not know if this is from the wall mounts or not moving around on the surface of it during the shipping or not, but that is my best guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Over all, if you shave in the shower this is a handy piece of equipment.</li>
    <li> I, like many others, have purchased &#x27;several&#x27; mirrors over the years to continue to shave in the shower.  Most would work for the first couple of showers with their &#x27;anti-fog&#x27; technology and then would dwindle quickly - almost as if the coating or &#x27;technology&#x27; washed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror, however, has been different so far.  I&#x27;ve intentionally held off writing a review on the product as I wanted to give it a go for a while in the shower before I made my opinion known -- I mean, I&#x27;ve had several of this type of mirror that have failed; why wouldn&#x27;t I think that this one would fail as well?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It hasn&#x27;t.  And shows NO indication that it&#x27;s going to...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it now for going on a month and it&#x27;s just as good today as it was out of the box.  The key is to READ THE INSTRUCTIONS.  It&#x27;s super simple... a trained chimpanzee could accomplish effective use with this mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works.  Get one.  It&#x27;s a little more expensive than what I wanted to pay for a shave mirror to accomplish a warm/wet shave but, it&#x27;s worth it.  I&#x27;ll post back if I start to see problems but, for now, it&#x27;s two huge thumbs up from this guy.  Nice product!</li>
    <li> Great shower mirror.  Does not steam up as advertised.  Holds  the razor nicely.  Sticks to wall well with no movement.</li>
    <li> This product works ok. It feels little cheap in the construction of it but it&#x27;s ok. The way you hang it is adhesive which I would prefer a suction cup so it would be easier to move it if necessary. After about a week it started fogging up. Which you can counteract by running it under the water but I keep getting a film over parts of the mirror also. I have to wipe it off everytime I use it. Overall ok product.</li>
    <li> My husband got a new shower installed and I ordered this mirror and razor holder for him. Now he&#x27;s shaving daily and looking good!!! He really likes it!</li>
    <li> Not really fogless. There is a coating of some kind on it that will keep it fogless for about a month, and I didn&#x27;t touch the mirror with any kind of cleaner. Just rinsed it with shower water when it had spots on it.</li>
    <li> So far the mirror performs as advertised. I have only had it long enough to have used it several times, but I followed the directions about rinsing it with warm water from the shower and wiping it with the bare hand before using each time, and it is indeed fogless and clear. I do not clean it with anything, but I do turn the mirror face to the wall when not in use, so as not to get stray dust and such on it.</li>
    <li> THIS MIRROR WORKS JUST AS THEY DESCRIBE IT AND THE COMPANY STANDS BEHINH THERE PRODUCTS. MY FIRST MIRROR GOT DAMAGED AND THEY SENT ME A REPLACEMENT AT NO CHARGE FOR ME TO TRY AGAIN. IT WORKS EXTREMELY WELL WITH NO PROBLEMS BUT BE CAREFUL TO HANDLE IT PROPERLY SO AS NOT TO SCRATCH IT</li>
    <li> If you are one who likes to shave in the shower (really, the benefits are threefold: your sink won’t get gross from all the hair, your skin will stay moist, and your razor stays warm and clean under the stream from the shower), this fogless shower mirror is exactly what you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a free mirror to review. All opinions are 100% my own.**</li>
    <li> The mirror was very easy to install in the shower.  Just wipe down your tile with alcohol, let dry, and adhere the enclosed hook.  After using the past few weeks, I can safely say the special coating on the mirror prevents it from fogging up.  I can clearly see myself in the shower even when the medicine cabinet&#x27;s mirror is completely fogged up.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any mildew buildup on the mirror either. My only complaint:  I wish it were larger.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I missed something in the directions or maybe I didn&#x27;t read them . I wiped off the mirror with windex and a paper towel and now it looks like someone took a razorblade to it. Not usable anymore :(</li>
    <li> NO fog at all!! My bathroom was almost a sauna, but the mirror kept pretty clean!&lt;br /&gt;Buy it! No doubt! And it&#x27;s still cheap.</li>
    <li> I got this mirror and was kind of skeptical on  whether or not it would work. Happily it did work. My husband really likes this since he doesn&#x27;t have to get out the shower and walk to the vanity area. I like it for washing my face. My little boy likes it to look at his self in it when I give him a bath.It makes giving him a bath much easier since he can see what is going on.&lt;br /&gt;It came in handy a few a weeks ago. My husband sprained his knee and was on crutches for a short time. This meant he was unable to stand for too long. The ability for him to remove the mirror and use it separately was great for him.&lt;br /&gt;I would gladly recommend this for anyone especially if their shower is in a separate area from their vanity areas. I would also recommend this for someone who cannot stand for long periods or is bed-ridden for any reason.</li>
    <li> Works great.  The size is perfect (I was worried it would be too small).  It was fog less for about a month.  Now I have to splash it under the water quickly before I shave, which is to be expected.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Easy to install. In the past it was a chore to shave. I would usually shave every other day. Now, with this mirror, I shave everyday. It also takes less time to shave because my beard is soft from being in a hot shower. Before, I would have to wait in front of the sink for the shaving cream to soften my beard. In addition, I believe I get more shaves out of each disposable razor, probably use less shaving cream, and don&#x27;t cut myself as frequently. Cleaning? Just run it under water.</li>
    <li> Awesome - get to shave in the shower again.</li>
    <li> Not the best fogless mirror -- I&#x27;ve tried tons of different cleaning methods but it still fogs up. It was truly &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; for about 4 days!</li>
    <li> This stays fogless as long as you do not turn on the shower...  but the design is easy enough to rinse off the fog and continue shaving....  very cheap, but you get what you pay for..  works fine, but be ready to continually rinse the fog off.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Easy to install. Works for gals underarms too - not just for men.</li>
    <li> NOT &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34;  You must constantly keep splashing warm water on this thing to keep it from fogging.  Very light and cheap feeling.</li>
    <li> Works great in the shower.</li>
    <li> Started out great, fogless and all...but after 2 weeks it is beginning to fog up.  I have used no cleaners or anything on it, and it simply hangs in my shower.  In fact, I actually spray down the whole shower each time I am in there, to make sure nothing is on the walls / mirror.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this and says it works well, unlike others he has owned.</li>
    <li> Not fogless at all.. All mess up while taking shower. I didnt clean with soup or anything. Just raisn up with water, but the worest part is you can not even see after raisn up.. DONT BUY!!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror as a gift for my husband who always shaves in the shower. How he&#x27;s never seriously cut himself is beyond me. He asked me to write a review to let people know not to bother with this &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirror. He says he can run it under water and get a couple of minutes of use before it fogs over again. Definitely not worth the $$!</li>
    <li> Not a fan of this mirror.  Just ok.  At least you can see yourself a little.  Foggy.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving in the shower for years and this is the best \\&quot;Fogless\\&quot; mirror that I have ever used.  Per your website if you order 2 or more you get free shipping. If I would have known that I would have ordered 2!</li>
    <li> I purchased originally on 5-13-14 and 3 months later the mirror was unusable - it appears the protective coating wore off. I&#x27;d only rinsed with warm water in the shower so contacted Cassani Company for a replacement. Their customer service was excellent and I received a replacement 2 days later. The first few months were great - the mirror remained fog-free. I again rinsed only with warm water but after 4 months the mirror has become as unusable as the first one. I&#x27;m going back to the ShowerTek WV2 Fog Proof Shower Mirror which I had a few years ago and it worked much better over several years. The only drawback with the ShowerTek is it attached to the shower head and requires water to flow through it. Seems a small sacrifice to be able to see when shaving.</li>
    <li> The mirror was &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; for about 2 weeks and now it instantly fogs over when the shower is on for just a few minutes.  I should have known that this product was too good to be true.  Product does not work as described and I was unable to find any customer service for this company.</li>
    <li> This is one of those items that makes me love Amazon. 10-15 years ago you would have had to spend half a day in a box store looking for an item like this, only to pay twice the price for an inferior product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is perfect for what it is. Both the hook and the mirror work perfectly. Sure, the mirror fogs after lots of steam. But all you have to do is run it under hot water for a second or two and it is back to being fog free. No complaints at all.  Perfect for shaving in the shower.</li>
    <li> This mirror becomes useless like all the others after a year.  I bought this in Jan of 2014..it worked great for about  8 months, and now in Jan 2015, I can not shave with out splashing it multiple times while shaving.  I get it is only $14 but who cares..I would rather pay $30 and not have to replace it in 12 months.  Now I have a that thing stuck to my tiles as well which may be a pain to get off.  If you want to buy again in a year..go for it.  I am shopping now for another.  I know it is not going to last a lifetime but this thing does not deserve to be the most high rated..far from it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just a simple mirror you&#x27;re supposed to use double sided tape (included) to attach to your wall.  I didn&#x27;t like this.  Cheap, and doesn&#x27;t fog up.  Based on that criteria, it&#x27;s great.  Functionality and design, poor.  Just my $0.02.</li>
    <li> So far (about 1 month), works as advertised.  I was skeptical hanging it from stone tile in my shower, but it hasn&#x27;t budged.  I like that it is simple to remove from it&#x27;s hangar to quickly rinse under the water, and then its good to go.</li>
    <li> Really works!! Husband loves it!</li>
    <li> Worked great for the first week. Now I may as well be shaving with my eyes closed. Just as fogged up as any other mirror would be.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a modest shower mirror. No problems setting it up. It was fogless for the first shower, but since then, it fogs up fairly quickly. I haven&#x27;t used any cleaners or cloths on it, as recommended. I hold it under the hot shower for a few seconds to bring the temperature up, as recommended, but it fogs back up after 10 seconds.</li>
    <li> Hilariously, this thing fogs up even when the normal mirror in our bathroom doesn&#x27;t. You had ONE JOB, fogless shower mirror. Thanks for nothing.</li>
    <li> Ok while it lasted but it only lasted for about six months before the protective finish on it started coming off.</li>
    <li> Mirror lost fogless abilities within two days</li>
    <li> I have used shower mirrors for over 20 years.  Most either keep falling off or they turn spotty and won&#x27;t clean.  This mirror is amazing.  It is extremely clear and, because of its lite weight, I don&#x27;t think it will ever fall!</li>
    <li> Likes-&lt;br /&gt;Very lightweight&lt;br /&gt;It comes with two hanging cord- one for the mirror; another one for the razor&lt;br /&gt;Very fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;It is great for travel/student who live in Dorm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes-&lt;br /&gt;The mirror texture is not smooth/plain.I mean you can see the wave pattern kinda view on it.&amp; I feel like it&#x27;s kinda disturbing when you use it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not even a glass mirror. (made with plastic,paper)&lt;br /&gt;As I mention above, the view is not smooth. and I see many scratch mark on the mirror!&lt;br /&gt;The mirror shape is smaller than I thought!&lt;br /&gt;You can see the Fog on the mirror, while taking shower!!! (Failed!)</li>
    <li> Not only is it quite attractive, the &#x27;Fog Free&#x27; feature really works. Just be sure to note the caution NOT to use cleaners on the mirrored surface. This, say the instructions, will wipe off the film that makes the mirror Fog Free.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the mirror installed in my shower for a few weeks now and it still works just as well as it did when I first got it. The install was quick and easy. Just stick the included double sided tape to the back of the hook and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
    <li> I do not understand why they charge around $15 for this item. I was very disappointed in this. It does not reflect accurate image. You do not want to stare at the mirror as it is eye tiring. I think amazon should not allow this type of item to be sold on their site as it is lowering the credibility of its own.</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to review the Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror which included a razor hook.  It uses Anti-Fog Nanotechnology to prevent the mirror from fogging in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Installation was easy.  Just peel the back from the adhesive on the back of both the razor hook and the fogless shower mirror hook and stick them where you want them to be in the shower.  Keep pressure on them for about 45 seconds and let them sit over night before hooking the mirror on it, and it’s ready to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we have a mirror in the shower so that my husband can shave while showering and take advantage of the warm, moist air.  I can put my razor on the razor hook so I can have it handy when I want to shave my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror which included a razor hook, which really does work and is reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How is The Cassani Shower Mirror Fogless?&lt;br /&gt;By warming the mirror with the shower stream, the difference in temperature between the shower air and the mirror disappears. With mirror and shower being the same temperature, there will not be any fog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where Should I NOT Place My Mirror?&lt;br /&gt;We recommend you placing your mirror away from areas in the direct shower stream or where cooler air may enter from outside the shower.  We also advise to try and keep the mirror away from spray as well.  Do a test run first before placing your mirror and razor hooks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How To Attach My Wall Mounts?&lt;br /&gt;1) Clean the area in your shower where you will put your mirror and razor hooks with rubbing alcohol and make sure the surface is very dry before putting the adhesives in place.&lt;br /&gt;2) Place pressure on the hook(s) for 30-45 seconds&lt;br /&gt;3) Allow the hooks a few hours to set before hanging anything on them. This will almost guarantee that your wall mounts stay in place as long as you need them to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Is The Best Way To Clean My Shower Mirror?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: Do NOT use cleaning products on this mirror.&lt;br /&gt;Our Anti-Fog Nanotechnology is infused into the reflection surface.  Using cleaning products here will very likely remove our anti-fog magic.  We recommend using regular soap, or simply rinsing it with water.  Any small amount of soap or even toothpaste can be rubbed on and rinsed off to clear away any water spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.ng products on this mirror.&lt;br /&gt;Our Anti-Fog Nanotechnology is infused into the reflection surface.

    <li> This product worked well for the first couple of weeks and now it fogs nearly as fast as a regular mirror</li>
    <li> I have never heard of a fogless mirror prior to purchasing the Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror however, I am now a fan.  Every bathroom should come equipped with at least one fogless mirror mounted on the wall.  Initially, I had reservations about the placement of an additional mirror in our bathroom as we had just broken the plastic framing of a suction-cup mounted mirror.  The design of this mirror is frameless and both the mirror wall mount and the razor wall mount easily and attached to the wall with the attached adhesive.  I have no idea about the process behind the Anti-Fog Nanotechnology, but it works and that&#x27;s all that matters.  I am very satisfied with this mirror, the prompt shipping and the friendly customer service.</li>
    <li> Would give it 5 stars but it came with scratches. But does the job</li>
    <li> I got this to be able to better wash my makeup off in the shower. Works great, but is definitely not fogless. I followed the instructions and have not even cleaned it yet, but it fogs up every time I&#x27;m in the shower. I just rinse it with water to use it.</li>
    <li> This mirror is so easy to use! We, as in my family and I love this fogless shower mirror. I give it 5 stars. So, shaving is a huge part of our lives, at least here in America. My husband and two of my boys are shaving now. My daughter and I both shave our legs and pits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting to review the Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror was awesome! It has been so much fun watching to see if the mirror was going to fog up, even after getting it wet, it has not fogged up on us.  It is very easy to set up, the razor holder and the mirror holder just stick on to the shower wall.&lt;br /&gt;*note* make sure you place it where you want it, the hooks do not move again. Mine is opposite of my shower head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My boys beg to use my bathroom so they can shave while they shower.  Makes it so much easier to do clean-up as well.&lt;br /&gt;I find it easier to wash my face while in the shower than over the sink. So I use to clean my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will so tell my friends about this for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** Edited to add, this mirror has begun to fog up. No cleaning products were used on the mirror. It just hangs in the shower. I am sad to say, this is no longer foggless. I have changed my rating.  I had such high hopes.</li>
    <li> For those complaining about it fogging up - here&#x27;s a quick fix - rub a little soap on your hand and wipe the mirror with it and voila! Clear mirror.</li>
    <li> It works but it certainly isn&#x27;t fogless.  Steams up really easily, but because of the design its also easy to just grab it and rinse under the shower.  I have to do this about 3 times during my shave, but it&#x27;s really not too inconvenient.</li>
    <li> the only downside to it that it doesn&#x27;t stay fogless for very long. a month in and it&#x27;s not as clear as it was.</li>
    <li> Works as described! Follow manufactures instructions on how to clean it! Should last a very long time! Happy with purchase!</li>
    <li> Product is ok.. still fogs up when temperature is hot, but splash a little water on it and its good to go.</li>
    <li> Others i&#x27;ve bought never lived up to their claims from the get-go. This one is clear viewing from beginning to end of shower. It&#x27;s leightweight for easy hand-holding, and doesn&#x27;t require constant rewetting to stay fogless.</li>
    <li> We got this mirror to put on the wall under our vanity mirror so our toddler can see herself while standing on a stool brushing her teeth.  It works great, BUT don&#x27;t clean it with anything, including vinegar!  It totally clouded up and is barely useable now.  Water only!</li>
    <li> This fogless mirror is great.  It&#x27;s simple and clean looking so it will work in any bathroom without looking tacky.  The mirror works great - no fogging up at all.  The installation of the mirror is super easy - no complicated instructions.  The razor wall mount works great, and should work fine for any razor. My only complaint is that the mirror is not adjustable, so once you place it that is were it stays. In our house I&#x27;m 5&#x27;2&amp;#34; and my husband is 6&#x27;0&amp;#34;, so obviously we would want the mirror located at different heights in our shower.  But even with that I would recommend this mirror without hesitation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER: I am a member of Tomoson and I have received a free product to try and review.

    <li> When I first got this mirror, I thought the 5 star reviews were spot-on. However, after 4-5 months, the mirror started fogging more and more quickly until finally, 10 months after purchase, I need to rinse it off 2-3 times per shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror has never been &amp;#34;cleaned&amp;#34; by anything other than water -- no cleaning agents or solvents or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a quick, temporary fix -- this mirror will be great. If you&#x27;re looking for something that lasts a bit longer, keep looking....</li>
    <li> The mirror was scratched when it arrived.  Also mine fogs up terribly.</li>
    <li> Works as intended. Makes shaving easier in the shower. Way less cuts on my face now</li>
    <li> Had the mirror for a day and then this film-like covering started creeping-up on the sides of the mirror. It now covers the entire mirror and it is useless. I followed the cleaning instructions, but it didn&#x27;t do any good. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Worked for about 3 days and that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> Works great and is a good size.</li>
    <li> This is advertised to not fog but it does. My man hasn&#x27;t said anything about it falling or the coating comin off yet. I hope I&#x27;m not even more disappointed and embarrassed for getting a product like this for him. I&#x27;ll cross my fingers that he doesn&#x27;t think it&#x27;s junk. I really hope it will work for him.</li>
    <li> This is a great addition to my morning ritual!!  I would love it if I could find a travel version of this mirror so that I can use it while I am on the road.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fog or fall down. Don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to buy this,</li>
    <li> Similar experience that others here have had. For the first couple of months, it was great. No fog at all. Then, it started getting a little foggy around the hole at the top where it hangs on the hook. Then, the center of the mirror would fog a little. Now, most of the mirror will fog unless I rinse it under the shower once or twice during a shave. Not the end of the world, but certainly not the greatest fogless mirror in history.  Also, after purchase, I started getting annoying emails from the seller, although to their credit, when I used the &amp;#34;unsubscribe&amp;#34; tab, they stopped.  All in all, an OK product, break-resistant and somewhat fog resistant mirror. Probably would not buy another one.</li>
    <li> It fogs up nearly every shower, even when it&#x27;s not very hot. Disappointed in that but it&#x27;s better than having no shower mirror at all. I just wouldn&#x27;t hang on the &amp;#34;Fogless&amp;#34; claim too much or else you will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror. It works great out of the box.  Please warn your wife or room mates not to clean it with anything. I am not sure, but I think this has a film of product on the surface of the mirror that you only want to rinse off with warm water.</li>
    <li> Great product, quality construction on both the mirror and hooks.  Would have liked for the back paper to be taken off as it was somewhat difficult to remove.  Very happy so far with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Caution! We received this mirror without the hook to hang it! Now i have to go through the hassle of returning it.</li>
    <li> As described. Wonderful!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheaper than the other alternatives and it JUST WORKS.  No fog, rather impressive.</li>
    <li> The mirror performs as advertised. I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase. Great price too.</li>
    <li> No issues after 3 weeks of use.  Has not fogged up once and is extremely clear image.</li>
    <li> Excellent product which (so far) performs as advertised.  Shipped quickly and price is reasonable.  I have only had it for a month so can not yet comment about the long-lasting nature (or lack thereof) of the anti-fog properties of this mirror.    Have used this product now for 6 months and unfortunately I have to edit my review, as the key feature - anti-fog performance - has failed.  It worked well for a couple months, but in the past 3 months or so the mirror becomes fogged very quickly (about 30 seconds) during a hot shower.  I have to constantly rinse it off with the shower head while shaving.  Makes shaving in the shower much less convenient.  I wanted to love this but am disappointed with the performance.  Seems like whatever \\&quot;nanotechnology\\&quot; they are marketing this as possessing is just some type of coating that wears off after a few months.  Can not recommend this product, even though it was cheap.</li>
    <li> it does what it&#x27;s for, and how it discribed</li>
    <li> It is the a great product to have in anyone&#x27; shower.  Though we see a man&#x27;s face shaving, for a woman I used it to tweeze my eyebrows. It does not fog up and make note do not clean it with anything other than a cloth.</li>
    <li> Awesome shower mirror. Easy installation and doesn&#x27;t fog. For reals!!</li>
    <li> Mirror works for a week or two and then completely fogs up like any other mirror. The instructions say to splash water on it to clear it up, however that only clears it up for 5-10 more seconds before fogging again. Does NOT work as advertised.</li>
    <li> Good product! Gave it three stars because its a very simple design and could have been less exspensive but, knowing that, i still would have bought it.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised, easy to install. Excellent speed of service.</li>
    <li> Originally I was very disappointed and ready to chuck it. There is a thin film on the surface that must be removed in order for it to be fog less.  VOILA!  Now works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Unlike other fogless shave mirrors, this one actually stood up to a steamy shower. It did not fog up for the whole duration of the shower. My husband was able to get a nice close shave this morning. I am just super happy I no longer have to clean whiskers out of my sink in the morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I review the mirror more in depth here http://tipsygypsyartco.blogspot.com/2014/08/cassani-fogless-shower-mirror-review.html</li>
    <li> Great product, works exactly as claimed. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. It really works stayed completely clear and fog free. My husband got the cleanest shave in his life!!! I recommend Cassani&#x27;s Fogless Shower Mirror!</li>
    <li> It works, but it&#x27;s not completely fogless for us. It&#x27;s handy, and serves it&#x27;s purpose...but It does fog up in the shower.  We followed the instructions, so all though we need to wipe it off in the shower, its still handy. I&#x27;m still glad we bought it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Ended up picking up a second as our house guest thought it was amazing also.</li>
    <li> easy to install - simple peel and stick - and then it just works great</li>
    <li> Works just as advertised, and it makes a huge difference in the ease of shaving in the morning.</li>
    <li> As others have said, fantastic little mirror that works as advertised. My only issue was that I am 6&#x27;6&amp;#34; and because of where I had to place the stainless steel mirror hanger, I could only see my chest in the mirror. I needed to angle the mirror to be actually able to see my face. Luckily the mirror also comes with a s.s. razor hanger! I simply put the razor hanger on the wall about 1/4 of the way down from the mirror hanger, hung the mirror and presto, the mirror was held up at an angle that allowed me to easily see my beautiful beard.</li>
    <li> This mirror is great, I received it in the mail yesterday and I a went hung it in shower (which was easy to do) and then took a shower to test if it really did work and it did! Not even in speck of fog in it after 45 minutes. I would recommend this to anyone who shaves in the shower or scrubs their face in the shower.</li>
    <li> My husband keeps raving about this and I can see that it&#x27;s much better than the mirror I had in there before.  My old one had suction cups on the back and would fall down occasionally.  This one has a very sturdy attachment and it never looks like it&#x27;s steamed up.</li>
    <li> After many years and many styles of shower mirror, we&#x27;ve found the perfect one. It&#x27;s of average size, but flat-to-the-wall (a bonus in my book) and truly fogless (which many of the others weren&#x27;t). With no frame, there&#x27;s no place for a razor, but the simplicity of it far outweighs that. We have them in three locations, and are quite pleased with them.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised, very clear and makes shaving in the shower very easy.</li>
    <li> My husband always had to shave before he got in the shower. If he shaved while he was in the shower he always missed spots. This mirror was so easy to hang in the shower. It comes with a razor hook which makes it his own area in the back of the shower. It doesn&#x27;t fog up. Make sure you read the directions on cleaning. If you use cleaning products on it, you can take off what makes it fogless.&lt;br /&gt;  This mirror is inexpensive. It will make a great gift from the kiddos for Daddy for Christmas. The man in your life will appreciate his own little area since when tend to take over everything in the bathroom. I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my fiance and he loves using it every day.  The mirror is bigger and taller than most others so he doesn&#x27;t have to contort his head in different directions the whole time he is shaving.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace another fogless shower mirror.  This one really works.  Amazing simplicity, stays close to the wall (my other one stuck out a good bit).  I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised how well it works!</li>
    <li> The mirror works like magic . I kept thinking I would buy one of the more expensive models out there but I sure  am glad I didn,t . You can not go wrong in fact I plan to buy another for my guest shower.</li>
    <li> This Cassani Fogless Shower mirror is a nice compact size.  It is clear, stays fogless and, even though it has no frills, it serves its purpose.  The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is that my husband and I are of different heights.  We have to move the mirror when either one uses it.  That is okay though, because I have been through so many shower mirrors, ones with and without radio.  It seems that the more expensive they are, the shorter they last.</li>
    <li> exactly as described, fast shipping</li>
    <li> Bought this item twice actually.  It does fog up or become spotty after a few uses but it is easy to wipe down and will stay clear long enough for a shave.  it is better than the other products available.</li>
    <li> Love the fogless aspect. It works perfectly, without batteries. The problem is that it scratches incredibly easily. I scratched mine with my fingernail while wiping soap scum off of it. It also didn&#x27;t come with a mounting bracket, which the instructions refer to. Weird, kind of annoying.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a nice, fogless shower mirror.  This one fits that bill, as it is sleek and has not fogged up in the hottest shower.  Very nice product.</li>
    <li> Purchased in July. Worked great until September. Now fogs up. Useless.</li>
    <li> Indeed, this mirror does not fog or cloud.  A great value for the money.</li>
    <li> Stayed fog-free for 2 weeks... Very disappointed but it does work just not fog-free</li>
    <li> No more dirty sink, Fogless Shower Mirror makes it so easy to shave and shower and it does not get fogy.</li>
    <li> Got the mirror on time as promised. Simple directions which i followed carefully. Using no cleaners or soap, just water if i need to rinse it off. Fogless so far. I held the hangers for 45 sec and cleaned off the area with alcohol before i attached the to the tile. Im am very happy with this product. I shave my entire head so i really need this product to work as advertised.</li>
    <li> Great mirror.  NO fog.  The razor holder is nice as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just about given up on using a mirror in the shower. Thank you to the fogless mirror, I can now prep and wash my hair and seeing what I&#x27;m doing. I love, love, love it. I take hot showers and steam up the bathroom mirror, so my dude loves to use it to shave while I&#x27;m in the shower. No more annoying complaints from him. Relationship saver! Lol</li>
    <li> This is the only mirror that has not fogged up.  I tried to fog it and could not.  Should have purchased this one first instead of the last 3.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly!  Would love another that magnified!</li>
    <li> I gave it as a present, it has worked so well that I will be giving more!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a better mirror.  Looks great on the wall, works great without fogging - simple and effective.  The guy on the package is smiling and for good reason - he has finally found a shower mirror that delivers what it promises.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. The mirror is very light and installs easily via an adhesive hook. It could stand to be a bit wider. So far, I haven&#x27;t noticed any fog on the mirror. It even comes with an adhesive hanger so you can hang your razor on the wall.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much for letting me try this for free. It has worked wonders for me and my husband who now shaves his face in the shower all thanks to your product we love it</li>
    <li> I got this product to review and to say honestly, it is pretty good. I asked my husband to try it out &amp; he loves the mirror as he doesn&#x27;t have itching or red bumps or cuts, since his skin softens up after the shower &amp; shaving doesn&#x27;t hurt; it is really amazing. Also no more messy sinks, as this comes with a  holder for the razor. Just hook the mirror &amp; the razor holder in the shower room &amp; its all done. Added to that, its not bulky and not made up of glass ( where it can hit on something &amp; crack/break accidentally). Definitely would recommend.</li>
    <li> So far this is exceeding my expectations. As long as you run warm water over it briefly it works fine. Cleaning the surface before you apply the adhesive backing will make it stay on much longer. A nice extra is the hook for the razor. Cut my shaving time down a lot by being to do this in the shower.</li>
    <li> Great Mirror..Works just as described...</li>
    <li> Worked great for the first couple weeks. Now it fogs up after a few minutes in the shower.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror for my husband for Valentine&#x27;s Day. He absolutely loves it!! This is the best mirror he has ever had and he was in desperate need of a new shower mirror. This was definitely highest rated for a reason!</li>
    <li> Great mirror for my husband. Great seller.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY! So this mirror worked great for being &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; for 1 week exactly. Now, it is no longer &amp;#34;fogless.&amp;#34; I cleaned it several times per the instructions and still no luck. I guess it was too good to be true. Returning this asap.</li>
    <li> Great service, although a little fragile looking this mirror holds up as fog less.</li>
    <li> Does not work. Fogs up in shower. One star because it hangs in shower and works when you squirt water on it to defogger it.</li>
    <li> I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHERE THESE GOOD REVIEWS ARE COMING FROM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This mirror is awful!! I seriously think the manufacturer is writing them or paying others to do so.... because it&#x27;s just bad. It&#x27;s completely fogged over BEFORE I&#x27;M EVEN IN THE SHOWER!!! Just waiting for the water to heat up.... FOGGED. Splashing water on it does not do anything. You cannot clean the thing because it&#x27;s not actually a mirror, so any cleaning products will ruin it. If i still had the box I would return it in a heartbeat! DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!</li>
    <li> This mirror works great and the adhesive is much better than the suction cups and the antifog is better than  other mirrors I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> Mirror looked great for the first 3 to 4 weeks. After 6 weeks the mirror is 50% fog free. After 3 months I can &#x27;t look clearly to be able shave.&lt;br /&gt;The coating does not last long in this mirror.&lt;br /&gt;Listing did not mention mirror ONLY has 2 to 3 months lifetime....</li>
    <li> great product. Very happy with it and the customer service.</li>
    <li> I followed all the instructions and no fogless mirror, it is good for holding your razor but i have to keep pouring water on top of it to use it for a min and again gets fog. I really followed all the details they instructed in the booklet but still disappointing :(</li>
    <li> Excellent mirror and easy to hang.</li>
    <li> Fogs up after a few weeks!  I fallowed all of the instructions exactly as they reccoment and it fogs up in a few minutes now.  Only lasted 10 to 14 days.</li>
    <li> Works great for about one shower and then it fogs like you wouldn&#x27;t believe... how in the heck does this thing have so many high ratings?</li>
    <li> I got this mirror and tried it out and wondered where it had been all my life! It lives up to what it claims,it indeed is fogless! Both myself and my fiance have gotten so much use out of it since we got it.He uses it to shave in the shower and I use it to apply facial beauty masks and pluck my eyebrows.I&#x27;m naturally a multitasker so this was right up my alley! I highly recommend this! I got this product free for purpose of review,all the claims and views are 100 percent my own.</li>
    <li> Work well. It&#x27;s lightweight and looks good in my shower. No problems with it staying in place. It can start to fog a little if the mirror is really cold and the water is really hot, but if you warm the mirror under warm water for a few seconds it goes away. The hook makes it easy to remove to do that. Great for removing makeup in the shower and when rinsing out hair color so I don&#x27;t miss any.</li>
    <li> Mine doesn&#x27;t work at all for some reason. I have moved it to different locations in the shower with the same result. It fogs over like a normal mirror. I have followed the directions and have not cleaned it with anything, other than to run water over it to remove the fog.</li>
    <li> If you need a mirror that will not fog up while taking a COLD shower than this is your mirror.  Its state of the art technology prevents it from fogging up when there is no heat.  However, if you decide to take a hot shower, this mirror will fog up faster than you can say #$%@, I can&#x27;t believe I bought this @##$%&amp; thing!  What a waste of money, not to mention it looks like something you could have bought at the dollar store.</li>
    <li> Everything is what it said, fogless and clear. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Works great so far. No fog. Attached easily to the shower wall. Very good buy for this price.Would recommend. good.</li>
    <li> Works well in the shower. Not too heavy that it falls off the wall and big enough for my husband to see his whole face when shaving.</li>
    <li> I bought this for shaving while in the shower.  The first time, it worked as advertised.  Ever since the first time, its fogged up within 10 seconds.  I have to take it off the hook and run it under the water multiple times during a shave.  At least the adhesive hook is still holding up!  It&#x27;s not totally worthless, but definitely not as advertised!</li>
    <li> This mirror is totally not fogless. It fogged as bad as any regular mirror.  I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
    <li> Worked amazing for the first year I owned it, then it began to completely lose its anti-fog properties over the course of several weeks. Water and hand soap (as recommended by the manufacturer in other reviews) was the only thing I cleaned it with. Running it under warm water no longer does anything. I did not have any problems with the adhesive hook (it was mounted to a glazed tile) unlike some reviewers.</li>
    <li> Why did I wait so long? A must have if you shave in the shower! Easy to install and clean.</li>
    <li> Mirror works perfectly. I&#x27;ve shaved in the shower for years and finally a clear mirror!! Shipping could have been faster but the product is awesome.</li>
    <li> Finally a shower mirror that doesn&#x27;t fog!. I&#x27;ve been through many of these and this one is great.</li>
    <li> The fogless shower mirror fogs up quite a bit</li>
    <li> First of all, this is NOT a fogless mirror. Unless you take cold showers it will fog with not a doubt. The description says that shaving in the shower softens the beard etc. But to do that the water must be a little hot. The instructions then say for those who take a hotter shower the mirror may need to have the fog wiped a bit, catch 22. Bottom line is this is not a fogless mirror. I gave it two stars because it has nice hardware to attach it to the tiles and looks good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to give it 5 stars anyway, because it truly deserves it... BUT I ruined mine by cleaning it one day :-(.  It&#x27;s an every day item in my bathroom, I didn&#x27;t remember it had special cleaning instructions, and to be fair, probably never read it in the first place anyway.  You should have seen my heart melt as my beloved mirror turned into a fogged up mess with just a quick spray of gentle eco-friendly cleaner.  Instantly ruined it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT CLEAN THIS THING!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what else they could have done other than etch DO NOT CLEAN into the mirror (which would be ugly anyway), so I&#x27;ll chalk this one up to lesson learned.  You bet I won&#x27;t forget next time!  Worked fantastic for the first couple months I had it.  Rarely ever needs to be cleaned as it is, I was just being anal retentive in a bathroom cleaning frenzies trying to get rid of 1 water spot.</li>
    <li> I feel some of the five star reviews are fake.  Just read the other one or two star reviews.  The mirror fogs-up after one use.  When you spray water on the mirror, it will un-fog for a few minutes only.  Like others, I followed all manufacturer directions.  I&#x27;ve also removed all wrappers from the mirror as the manufacturer suggests.  Threw the packaging away so now I can&#x27;t return.  Am disappointed.  One star because the mirror hangs nicely.  How this mirror received five stars from people with only one review to their name is highly suspect....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer saw the review (unaltered above) and sent another mirror.  Same fogging issues no matter what bathroom and what placement in the shower the mirror resides.  I resorted to the old trick of smearing shaving cream on the mirror and then buffing it out to make the mirror &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34;.  You can do that with any mirror.  Only difference here is this hangs nicely (hence one star rating).  Search YouTube to find the shaving cream trick.  I&#x27;m still disappointed the mirror seems like a &amp;#34;too good to be true&amp;#34; deal or perhaps just a bad product production run?  I hope the seller starts making a product that works as this is a good concept.</li>
    <li> The mirror is a nice size; attaches securely. But the &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; feature lasted exactly three showers. Now it completely fogs up within seconds; and I have to rinse water over it to see while I&#x27;m shaving about every 20-30 seconds. Very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed all the instructions, did not clean it or treat it with anything. It just doesn&#x27;t work as advertised.</li>
    <li> This item doesn&#x27;t distort your image. It also doesn&#x27;t fog up. I feel that this is a good product that works well. The shape of the mirror is sleek and can look good in any bathroom decor. The accessories seem pretty high quality. If you need a mirror for the shower or bathroom, I do recommend.</li>
    <li> good quality and like the hook for your razor.</li>
    <li> I bought my husband two fogless mirrors this Christmas because we&#x27;ve gone through several that have been awful.  I was intrigued by the reviews on this product and so far they have proven to be correct!  It works just as described and we&#x27;ve had it up for 3 months without any sign of fogging.  The other mirror I purchased is for him to travel with and this one remains at home.  Cassani sent us emails before it arrived with very useful tips and directions.  Follow their suggestions and you&#x27;ll be very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Nothing ti do with fogless...I have to keep rinsing the mirror..waisted money</li>
    <li> This lasted less than a week before the chemical on the glass started to come off.  it made the surface of the mirror all oily and distorted so i wiped it off.  the mirror still worked for a while because i would take it off the hook and put it under the hot shower water.  as long as hot water was on it,  it would stay clear (as do all mirrors). but there seemed to be permanent water spots on the mirror and i got tired of messing with it.</li>
    <li> It does not work! Fogs up in cool bathroom shower. Tried running it under hot water as recommended, but fogs up again. Totally unsatisfactory.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, maybe I just got a bad one. It had an imperfection in the middle of it. First time I bought something from Amazon and it didn&#x27;t work, maybe next time I won&#x27;t throw away the box so I can return if it doesn&#x27;t work,  my mistake.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m not really sure what i was expecting...some flimsy piece of sorta reflective plastic or something...but this little thing gets compliments from people about that cool little mirror i have hanging in my shower...works great, looks neat...didn&#x27;t really understand that it dangles from a stick on hook, but i like it</li>
    <li> Best mirror for shaving in the shower</li>
    <li> Awful. It not only fogs up but the hook that comes with it, doesn&#x27;t stay put. Total waste of money. Within seconds of using this mirror, the condensation forms causing streaking and beading, followed by fog. Keep searching, this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
    <li> My mirror is fogging up.  FYI...</li>
    <li> With in 1 month it started to fog up and has never worked the way it says it doe&#x27;s! Not happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I have no idea why I never looked into a proper shower mirror before! I have been living with a cheesy free suction type mirror that was 2x4inches, and not at all clear!&lt;br /&gt;I saw a promotion for the Fogless Shower mirror by Cassani Co. and decided I needed to have this in my own shower!! The pictures were worth 1,000 words, and I had to have it and test it!&lt;br /&gt;Upon arrival it was packaged in a box, just like the picture. It came with clear instructions of how to properly stick the mounts for the mirror and razor holder.&lt;br /&gt;Installation took just seconds!&lt;br /&gt;This morning in the shower I could see..and clearly! How amazing after all these years, never really knowing what I was missing until I have this one hanging in my shower!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a nice hot steamy shower, and the mirror never fogged a bit...now, if I could get that same technology on my bathroom mirror, I&#x27;d love that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband was very pleased as well. He&#x27;s never been one to shower and shave in the shower, but I made him try it today!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is now going to make some shaving changes! He said he can see better, more close up, and since his face is warm from the water, he can get a much closer shave then shaving at the bathroom sink!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s a bonus for me since not only will his face be smoother longer, but now I will not have those pesky whiskers all over my bathroom sink area!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it came with the hook for the razor, so I can hang the razor instead of having it sit on the ledge of my shower. Nice bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror to replace one that had become scratched from Brookstone. We have used it for a couple of weeks and it works great..visibility is fine and it was easy to install.</li>
    <li> It is not fogless..... when used inside the shower.</li>
    <li> I would not buy this mirror at this time. Here is e-mail I received from merchant a few days after I ordered my unit on 2/25/15.  &amp;#34;Due to an error in manufacturing a small portion of our recent inventory is not up to our usual standards and we are working to correct this for our next run of Fogless mirrors. If you receive one of our substandard mirrors please contact us so we can send out a new mirror or issue you a full refund immediately. We sincerely apologize for this issue and we appreciate your understanding. &amp;#34; I assumed my unit was fine so I hung the unit. But, it is defective.  My unit fogs up in about 60 seconds. If you splash water on it will clear up for 20 seconds or so. I have contacted the merchant on their website via their contact form 4 days ago without an answer.  I like the mirror and it was easy to install and looks nice.  I don&#x27;t want to return it to Amazon, I just need a mirror that works, I have already mounted hardware in shower.  That said, my guess is this merchant has a bad batch and should stop selling on Amazon and wait for a batch that is up to their standards.  I hope once I am contacted and get a working mirror I can update this review.  Seems like a great product, clear instructions - just does not work and company appears to be aware of the issue based on e-mail they are sending.</li>
    <li> Terrible.  It&#x27;s only fogless if you don&#x27;t use it in the shower.  I don&#x27;t get how they get away with claiming this is fogless in the shower.  I have used other products that have worked much better.</li>
    <li> The mirror doesn&#x27;t work and fogs up every time you turn on the shower...  The distributor, Cassani Company, doesn&#x27;t stand by their product &amp; even stated that they were aware of the mirrors being substandard, which also describes Cassani&#x27;s &amp;#34;Customer Service&amp;#34;...</li>
    <li> Excellent reflection. Doesn&#x27;t fog.</li>
    <li> A big big big joke this fogless works only for cassani company. If possible they can send me one thats really is a fogless mirror</li>
    <li> I like the size of the mirror ant the way it attaches to the shower wall.  It was just what I was looking for.  My only complaint is that it started fogging up a short time after I started using it.  Not a big problem just splash some water on it to clear it up.</li>
    <li> works great! No more fogging.</li>
    <li> All the reviews were correct. Best shower mirror I have ever own!!!</li>
    <li> Shower mirror worked as stated. Stickers are very adhesive and actually comes with a razor blade holder which was unexpected. Bravo!</li>
    <li> ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ They&#x27;ve nailed it. Out of all of the fog less shower mirrors on the market, this one works. It is unencumbered by unnecessary mounts, brackets, springs, and suction cups. It works because it&#x27;s simple.</li>
    <li> When I was doing research to replace an old and useless shower mirror, this one caught my eye because of the customer ratings.  In my view a product with less than ten percent one ratings and over fifty percent fives is probably a decent one.  All manufacturing  processes have quality assurance programs, but occasionally a defective product slips through the cracks.  It is simply a matter of how big the cracks and I figured I had a pretty good chance of getting a decent product so I bought it.  Unfortunately, the one I got failed the test.  Almost immediately the anti-fog coating developed hairline cracks and started to peel off. After a week or so, it was almost completely useless and I would have returned it to amazon and rated it a one had I not gotten an email from the company asking me how I liked the mirror and requesting that I give them a good review on amazon. They also asked that I contact them if there were andy issues or problems, so I decided to do so before returning it.  Finding their email was bit of challenge because correspondence coming through amazon automatically deletes contact information, but I prevailed and contacted their customer service.  I was pleasantly surprised at how fast they responded and after sending them a picture of the mirror, they sent me a new one, which arrived the next day.  The replacement mirror is much better and works pretty well.  It has been a cold winter and most mornings the bathroom is cold and the shower is hot. The mirror does fog up a little bit under these conditions, but a rinse under the hot water takes care of the fogging problem, which is very minor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would probably have given this product either a three or four star rating, if not for their customer service.  Any company that follows up, does what it says it will do, and does it when they say they will do it deserves the highest rating in my book.  Buy the product and if you are unlucky enough to get a defective one, contact them and they willmake it right.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work and cheaply made</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really buy the nono technology stuff but the mirror works well in the shower. Expect to hit it with water to keep it from fogging but only once per shower. That ain&#x27;t so hard. I bought one just before I moved to another house and left it for the next tenant rather than trying to remove it from the wall of the shower. Just bought another one instead.</li>
    <li> I find the need to constantly wet the mirror in order to reduce/ eliminate fogging.</li>
    <li> Finally, no more razor burn. The mirror does smudge a bit but easy fix i just brush it with water with my fingers. DO NOT USE SOAP TO CLEAN, it will mess up the mirror and start to fog it, just rinse with water and it will be clear again. Love the razor holder too. Just make sure to place at face level while you&#x27;re standing in shower as you normally would.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a replacement for my gimmicky fogless+light Bed Bath &amp; Beyond gadget which I put up with for too many years.  This is 100x less fog, 10x more classy.  Even my wife made a comment how great it looks and I never have any trouble seeing into it clearly.  The Cassani Company does a great job with instructions and follow up, and the tip to put it out of spray&#x27;s way is right on the nose.  Overall great product so far.</li>
    <li> it is practical and works but unfortunately my maid washed and it does not work the same anymore...</li>
    <li> Clearest mirror I&#x27;ve ever had in the shower!</li>
    <li> Tried multiple so called fogless shower mirror and every one of them has failed to meet my expectation.  But out of all them, this is by far the best that I have used.  Although it is not 100% fogless as it fogs up a little at times, but once you wipe it across with your hand, it goes away unlike the others where the fog will come right back.  The style and the durability is great and makes my shower a bit more modern feel to it as you have the shaver holder to match it.  Great value for the money</li>
    <li> It was very easy to install. I used it once and was able to shave with no fog. I have not found any cons to this mirror yet but will post them if I find any.</li>
    <li> This is an important purchase as I use it everyday, and I am 100% satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;-Its an adhesive backed hook (perfect for my textured shower wall that suction cups wont adhere too)&lt;br /&gt;-its lightweight (great at not destroying anything when, and there will be a when, it falls)&lt;br /&gt;-its all plastic (no rust)&lt;br /&gt;-the image is clear (very little distortion, worth mentioning as some reviews claimed this was an issue, but I&#x27;m not shaving 5 feet away)&lt;br /&gt;-no more rubbing soap on the mirror (this is my favorite feature... although it will fog a bit, because its on a hook, I just grab it, put it under the hot shower water and back on the hook and its good for about 5 minutes; i will never go back to a suction cup mirror again)&lt;br /&gt;-customer service (I did deal with someone from customer service, and there are helpful and there for you if you need it)</li>
    <li> It still fogs up! My husband likes having the hands-free thing while in the shower now but with it fogging up, defeats the purpose and he has to stop and clean the mirror.  Not the greatest.</li>
    <li> Great mirror. Great price, works well -- truly stays fog-free. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this mirror to others.</li>
    <li> Fogless for 18 seconds at a time then you have to wipe the fog off. Completely false advertising. Do NOT recommend.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this mirror.  I wish it were slightly larger and had a lighted frame option but this does the job well.</li>
    <li> I did receive this product for free to review. That being said, I&#x27;m not impressed. When I first received the mirror, it was easy to set up. It worked the first two times I took a shower. By &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; I mean it didn&#x27;t get foggy. Now, I can&#x27;t take a shower without it fogging up every single time like a normal mirror. I have never washed it (per instructions) so I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s failing. Overall I&#x27;m pretty disappointed</li>
    <li> Great Mirror! Actually works! Husband loves it!</li>
    <li> Looks flimsy, but it works great in the shower! I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I feel the need to post a review here, mostly because I feel a bit misled by the enormous amount of positive reviews. First, let&#x27;s start with the positive and just say that the customer service of the company is top-notch. When I got my first mirror and assumed it was defective because of how quickly and dramatically it fogged up, I sent an email stating as such to the company. I immediately got a response apologizing for the fact the mirror didn&#x27;t work and was told a new mirror would be on its way ASAP. Indeed, I received the mirror and was hopeful that the second mirror would provide a better experience. Sadly, it fogged up almost as badly as the first (and even had a few small scratches on it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So just getting to the product. The mirror itself looks kind of cloudy to begin with as it doesn&#x27;t appear to be exactly a glass product; I just assumed that had something to do with trying to make the mirror fogless. given the mirror is far from fogless, i&#x27;m guessing it has more to do with making the product inexpensive. I did dig the enclosed mirror and razor holders - they stuck to the tile nicely and look pretty decent so i will use them. Unfortunately, the mirror itself just doesn&#x27;t do the job; despite following all of the recommended tips and suggestions, the mirror basically fogs up within a couple of minutes at most (admittedly, I do like a hot shower, so maybe it would do a better job in a lukewarm shower -but then what&#x27;s the point of that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By spraying the mirror with water you are able to remove most of the fog (reminds me of the zadro mirror i used before), but it comes back pretty quickly so getting a shave is not so easy to do without constant resplashing the mirror with water. Anyway, the product would get one star, but the appreciated customer service bumps it up a notch.</li>
    <li> shatter proof, does not fog, easily moved because it mounts with a suction cup .  Love It ;)</li>
    <li> Foggy mirror - this thing worked great for exactly one shower, then it fogged up like a high school kid&#x27;s car on prom night.  I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. I put this in my shower and use it daily. It is compact and works great will not fog up</li>
    <li> After a week of using this mirror, it has not fogged and stays securely on the wall.  The razor hangar is very handy.</li>
    <li> The advertisement for this product is great.  I get it home and I follow ALL instructions to hang it in the shower.  Do everything is says and suggests.  I hang it leave the room and hear a bang.  The bracket that holds the mirror fell.  Will not stay on the wall. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
    <li> The Fogless Shower Mirror is literally a miracle in my household. For one my husband has a long beard and is constantly shaving it and shaping it and this tool has been a huge help for him. When I purchased the Fogless Mirror he was not convinced that it would really work but I told him I bet you it will. So he pulled it out and &amp;#34;installed&amp;#34; it. Let me tell you it was the most easiest installation I have ever seen done. Yes this mirror did not let us down. It works like a champ and doesn&#x27;t fog up at all!!! So he can have fun in the shower trimming and maintaining his beard and I can exfoliate my face with the luxury of seeing my face in the shower while I do it. No more getting soap in my eyes or missing any spots. I love this mirror and might even purchase another one for our guest bathroom!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product didn&#x27;t work for me. I contacted the seller &amp; they did provide great customer service by offering to ship me a new mirror free of cost. After about a week of using my mirror- it started to fog which is exactly what happened with my first one. Contacted the seller a second time for a refund.</li>
    <li> Now as a woman, I can’t tell you about shaving my face because I don’t have anything there to shave :-) But my husband does have a goatee and he really did like using it in the shower to help with trimming up his face. I can also see where it would be beneficial for women to help shave their bikini area as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But where I found the mirror to be the most helpful was when I dyed my hair and I was able to not only take the mirror off the hook it comes with me and move it around to use outside of the shower to make sure that I had the back of my hair covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what I absolutely loved was using it in the shower rinsing the dye out of my hair, I was able to make sure that I had all of the dye off of my hairline.  As someone who dyes their hair pink, it is super important to make sure that you rinse until the water runs clear and with the mirror I was able to use it see the water actually coming off my hair instead of relying on the water at the bottom of the shower. Which incidentally turns the tub base pink temporarily and makes it difficult to see if your truly getting clear water running off your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you are running extremely hot water, the mirror does live up to the promise of not fogging up and if it does fog, per the instructions just give it a quick rinse and it will prevent it from fogging up again. I did find that to be true to an extent, your really do need to run it under the water to bring it up closer in temperature to the temperature in the shower to prevent it from fogging up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a separate note, when I was first opened it up and was looking at it, my English Mastiff was throughly enthralled with the mirror and her reflection.  Many times she walked up and put her nose directly on the mirror and it never fogged up.  She also loved trying to find out where that other dog was :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All around this is a great mirror for in the shower.</li>
    <li> We purchased this to use along with a shower installed water pik.  The mirror is exactly as described.  It doesn&#x27;t fog up at all and the image is very clear.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This mirror is super easy to install, and it blows my old mirror away.  Now I can shave in the shower without leaving patches of hair all over my face!  Thanks Cassani Company for putting out such a great product!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not really fogless.  I&#x27;ve used a bunch of them over the years and this is the same basic thing...gets fogged up slightly slower as a regular mirror.</li>
    <li> Still fogs after having replacement sent, but the customer service bumps it up a star</li>
    <li> The mirror isn&#x27;t solid so it doesn&#x27;t show the object (me!) clearly.</li>
    <li> Nice style. But still Foggy in shower</li>
    <li> This mirror mounts easily and cleanly on my ceramic tile shower wall. It also has a neat little separate hanger for your razor, which attaches to the shower wall wherever you choose. Here&#x27;s my difficulty with this product: I find that I have to spray the mirror two or three times in the course of my shave in order to remove some fog that always builds up. I had hoped for better, but this mirror certainly is an improvement over a more expensive anti-fog mirror I purchased a few years ago from Sharper Image.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Fogs up as soon as the shower is turned on.</li>
    <li> After about a month, this was completely ineffective. It&#x27;s cheaply made and it will be lucky to remain fog free after a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Read all the bad reviews, they are accurate!! I bought it and it was good for about 2-3 weeks.  Two months have passed since I bought it and it is completely unusable.  Wish I spent a bit more money on a quality product so I wouldn&#x27;t have to buy again.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have had this mirror for a week and it has not fogged up once. Best formless mirroring have owned.</li>
    <li> A simple, but well made, mirror that is just what it says: fogless! While it comes with a nice stainless hook to use for hanging it (and a matching razor holder) for me its was best hung on my existing wall-mounted caddy. No more open the curtain to try and catch a glimpse of myself through the main mostly fogged-up bathroom mirror; this works better! Cassani also follows-up on your order with emails to make sure you&#x27;re happy and getting good use of their product; an awesome level of customer service rarely seen anymore. Very pleased - highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I am someone that reads reviews thoroughly before I decide to buy something. Despite the few negative reviews I thought I would give this product a try. Within a minute of my shower being on, the mirror completely fogs up. I have the mirror on the opposite end of my shower from the shower head and a new ventilation fan slightly above the shower. This mirror isn&#x27;t even useable. It&#x27;s a great size and looks nice, just unfortunate that it doesn&#x27;t hold up to its name &amp;#34;fogless mirror&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> The mirror is great, you just need to follow their directions to get the best experience from it. As someone mentioned earlier, they do send you a lot of follow up emails.</li>
    <li> I recently got cassani fogless mirror as a part of promotion, and the product does whatever it claims of. Its an amazing product as I need it everyday while having shower. I highly recommend this product for all those people who have a habbit of multi tasking while having shower.</li>
    <li> Works great. Husband is happy.</li>
    <li> So far, this has been the best shower mirror I&#x27;ve ever had. It hasn&#x27;t fogged so much as accumulated some condensation that had not effected visibility. But, I just run it under the hot water as per the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions and the condensation goes away and does not occur again, unlike most other mirrors that just fog up again. I am glad that I spent the extra money for a decent shower mirror and look forward to seeing how long this mirror will actually last.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s small but big enough for my face. OH wait, is that how I look in the shower? I can see my pimples I can see my black head I can see my- ok that&#x27;s enough  I received this exchange for my UN-BIAS and honest opinion and review!  4 stars because the mirror can get damaged if not careful. I have to explain to everyone in the house before I dare put this on the wall.</li>
    <li> *Disclaimer* I was sent this product for free for review purposes. ALL opinions and thought are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the opportunity arose to review this product, I had to ask myself, would I, as a woman, use this? Would my husband use this?  As he is currently refusing to shave his beard! But, I decided, what the heck? Why not, it couldn&#x27;t hurt to check it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Installation was super easy. The instructions state to clean the area and make sure it is completely dry, peal off the backing of the foam sticker, press it to the desired area firmly for 2 minutes. I followed the instructions and was able to install both the mirror mount and razor mount in under 5 minutes. I decided to install the mirror opposite of the faucet as I felt that would be the best area to be able to see my face without having water running down it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the mirror for almost 2 weeks now. I have to say that I am impressed. The mirror hasn&#x27;t fogged once and surprisingly I&#x27;ve used it myself! I find it easier to wash my face in the shower and even shave my underarms! As odd as it sounds, I feel more comfortable being able to inspect and see that I got every hair! I also seem to have developed an obsession with staring at myself while I wash my hair! My husband was even impressed, his exact words were “I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s a mirror from hell, I stood in front of it breathing onto it and it didn&#x27;t fog!” Yes, that&#x27;s his unique way of telling me he likes it lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to what I stated above, some other things I like about the Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror are it&#x27;s design. It will look good in any bathroom décor. It&#x27;s very lightweight, so I don&#x27;t feel that it will fall under it&#x27;s weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to pay special attention to is cleaning. The instructions are very specific in how to clean the mirror. They state to not use any chemicals on the mirror and to only use water and a soft cloth. They say using chemicals on the mirror can destroy some of the anti-fogging properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have some concerns though. The mirror seems to be mounted on a type of cardboard and I worry that in time it will possibly getting soggy or mold. I also wonder how easy it will be to remove and reinstall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite my concerns, I fully recommend the Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror. Everything that Cassani has claimed seems to be true.</li>
    <li> It works great, but not for long. I&#x27;ve now had three of them, and the same thing has happened each time-they fail in two or three months. When the mirror is just out of the box it is great. No fog at all. I think that it doesn&#x27;t fog because the reflective surface seems to be covered with a very low-surface tension coating. Water doesn&#x27;t bead up;  instead it spreads out and covers the surface of the mirror evenly.  So no fog can form over the thin coating of water because steam condensing onto water just makes...more water. Clever. But the coating, as other negative reviews note, is very fragile. It is damaged with minimal contact. My third and final mirror became scratched and non-functional with almost no handling. Maybe occasional contact with fingers or a washcloth, that&#x27;s all, at least as far as I could tell. I certainly tried to be careful with it. Maybe Amazon could offer a subscription so that it would automatically be replaced 4 times a year. Or maybe you&#x27;ll buy something else. That&#x27;s my solution now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for about 20 years so I consider myself an expert in the field. Don&#x27;t mistake me for other 38 year olds who pretend like they shave, I&#x27;ve been doing this for a long time, 20 years at least as stated previously in my review. This mirror reflects light in a way that makes it appear as if there&#x27;s another world inside of it with a person that looks just like you. Buy it just for that reason!!</li>
    <li> It worked great for the first little bit, but it stopped working within 3 months. It fogs up now immediately and every time. I&#x27;ve finally resorted to putting a little soap on it and that seems to work, but then why even purchase a fog free mirror?</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. This is great mirror for the shower. Would buy again. I looked at several options and I&#x27;m pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Better than anything else I&#x27;ve used; just use your wet fingers to clear any condensation and it stays clear.</li>
    <li> Great little mirror that does as it says. Super simple install with a razor holder that my bf loves. Great as a gift too. My roommates were jealous of ours so they went out and bought one that was similar from somewhere else that they ended up hating. They&#x27;ll be getting theirs from here as soon as they can.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a simple &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirror and stumbled upon this one. It came with a mirror, mirror mount, and razor mount. I liked the set up and it was simple to install. First week using this mirror was awesome. No problems at all. After a week, the &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; feature of the mirror disappeared. I love everything about the mirror except for the fact that the mirror fogs up every time i take a shower. I would consider this before buying this product.</li>
    <li> even following the numerous instructions I received for the mirror it still fogged up. It still works good for a mirror in the shower.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to have received my husbands Cassani fogless Mirror in the mail!&lt;br /&gt;This to me meant no more messes in my bathroom sink!! That alone was worth a million stars. I, excitedly, opened the package and immediately followed the direction on how to install it into the shower. INCLUDES STAINLESS STEEL RAZOR HOOK – The perfect addition to your new shower mirror, keeping your razor wherever you want it and always ready for action. This means more room on my bathroom sink. Cassani Detachable Fogless Mirror is ideal for home or travel use – Hassle-Free&lt;br /&gt;The ANTI-FOG NANOTECHNOLOGY – Their patented technology is infused directly into the reflective surface of the mirror to repel fog, leaving you free to focus on getting the perfect shave.This, according to my husband, is amazing. Before he received the Cassani fogless mirror he had fought with our bathroom mirror being fogged up. Resulting in our bathroom window being open and making it a very cold shave.&lt;br /&gt;NEW MODERN DESIGN! – OPTIMAL VIEWING – The improved modern design was voted on by thousands of customers. My husband being one of the thousands , The new Cassani Fogless Mirror has added width and height to match the shape of your face and neckline, making the best use of space in any shower. This is also a great thing for me in the shower. I can see when I wash my face and do my eye brows!&lt;br /&gt;This was a great addition to our household. Not just for my husband, but for three girls!</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this.  The fogless thing is not very good.  I followed the directions to the letter &amp; you will have to wash it off 2-3 times during your shower to shave.  It fogs up pretty quickly.  It was easy to install &amp; held quite well.  It is plastic &amp; will not be a problem of breaking.  I gave it 4 stars because of the fogging.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste you money.</li>
    <li> Great Product. Does as advertised and was much needed while shaving in the shower.  Another mirror I used was bad because it wasn&#x27;t fogless and after a while you get tired of wiping.  This mirror resolved that issue completely.  Comes with the mirror, the attachment (to hold the mirror) and the attachment to hold the razor.  Both sticks and holds to the tile even after a couple of days use, so it showed no signs of losing their grip.  Overall a great product!!!!!</li>
    <li> This company also has a mirror holder as well.  Even after proper installation, it will fall down.  I would stay far away from this company.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t look like much when you take it out of the box, but don&#x27;t be dismayed.  It does everything it promises to do.  Easy to install and now my husband only shaves in the shower.  He thinks it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
    <li> Great look and larger mirror but it still fogs up.  Had it for a couple of months and it is fogging up in the shower as soon as a little steam hits it.  Very disappointing based on everything I read about the product.</li>
    <li> This shower mirror happened to be in my wish list as I have wanted to shave in the shower (and be precise with my sideburns) for some time.  My wife picked this up for me as a little Father&#x27;s Day gift from her because she knew I&#x27;d had my eye on it for a while.  That is where the love I attribute to this mirror ends.  It is fair at best.  It is a thin mirror and has a cardboard backing and, unfortunately, the mirror fogs up pretty quickly.  It is a nice size and the mounting hook affixes securely to a tile wall, but I find myself wiping it several times throughout my shower.  For reference, I have a stall shower with a curtain so the bathroom does not have excessive steam and the mirror is mounted in a place where it does not get directly hit by streaming water.  Despite my high hopes, the nanotechnology let me down.  Maybe my expectations were too high.</li>
    <li> The damn thing fogs up, and yes I followed all of the instructions, just too lazy to return it.</li>
    <li> Good Mirror, but the adhesive failed after 48 hours.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this for the fogless property -- like any mirror it&#x27;s going to get water marks -- but it is a convenient, light-weight, hand-held mirror that&#x27;s great for shaving in the shower and won&#x27;t break if you drop it.</li>
    <li> this is a great shower mirror! does not fog up and made for an easy shave due to being able to see what i am doing! i highly recommend for yourself and your significant other! i really like the great price tag too! so glad i had the opportunity to test and review for free!</li>
    <li> Fogs up.  No good  in hot shower.  It should be a  minus one rating.</li>
    <li> This mirror is not FOGLESS by no means. If you run water over it to warm the glass, then it will stay fogless for a few miniutes but nothing like the description claims.</li>
    <li> This mirror fogs in my shower. Normally I have to take it off the hook and rinse it under water a couple of times during a shave. I&#x27;ll be going back to the ToiletTree model with the water reservoir on the back.</li>
    <li> Works very well! I use the holder with suction cup to hook the mirror. I can move the mirror around to get better view of my shave.</li>
    <li> Completely functional mirror, but fogs up very quickly.</li>
    <li> This is better than the other one Amazon sells.  I have 2 of both ones..this one stays fogless better.</li>
    <li> I have purchased several mirrors for my husband over the years. This is the best one yet. The mirror itself is of a better quality with no distortion and no fogging whatsoever. Hopefully, the hook it rests on will not rust. Other mirrors framedwith metal always eventually rust. Since there is no frame it should be ok</li>
    <li> I installed it but it fell after the first shower. The sticky substance doesn&#x27;t hold if you take hot showers.</li>
    <li> Fogs up almost immediately in the shower. Customer service is very nice, as they sent me a new one when I said the first mirror fogged up. But the replacement I received did the same thing. Doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Works good for a month or so.</li>
    <li> This is a follow up review (April 24, 2015) Tried everything I could, including water surface tension reduction sprays. Nothing seems to work very well. I&#x27;ll look for something else to do a more credible job; Nanotechnology isn&#x27;t it, though it sounds good. For now, it&#x27;s back to the sink when shaving. Will post again, IF I come up with a more suitable solution.    Purchased Product on March 12, 2015. Installation was a breeze, and both mirror and shaver holder are doing what they are supposed to. However, after using it a few times, the mirror started to show fine drops (NOT fog) and even after splashing it and turning shower off, the drops formed again within seconds from the water layer on the mirror. Appears that water surface tension helps in forming drops, impairing the mirrors use significantly and degrading the shaving process pretty much to a tactile operation. Don&#x27;t know if spraying it with a surface tension reducing spray would help. Haven&#x27;t done so yet because I wanted to strictly follow the manufacturers directions. However, the &#x27;Nanotechnology&#x27; is definitely gone. -I am at a loss; really wanted it to work well, but don&#x27;t know how to do so. Maybe some advice from the supplier??</li>
    <li> 1 week into it...but love it. It is clear even in a hot shower, and since I put it right on top of the old mirror that came with the shower column, I can really see the difference. Great product - and love the hang hook that it comes with -- seems to be holding up well in the shower.</li>
    <li> ehh its ok but when it gets steamy you can see anything in it</li>
    <li> What happen? For the first four days this mirror was fog free I thought wow finally a fogless shower mirror that lives up to it&#x27;s name.Then day 5 it started fogging up like all the others and I kept having to clean it off with water to finish my morning shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes I followed the directions, yes I pulled the plastic film off and no my showers are not the hottest I can stand. Maybe one day there will be a fogless shower mirror that truly stands up to it&#x27;s name but unfortunately this is not one of them. Keep looking my friend!</li>
    <li> I paid more for this product because of its nanotechnology.  It is so &amp;#34;nano&amp;#34; it is not existent.  Fogs every time.  I followed the directions.  Adjusted my shower head so it doesn&#x27;t touch the mirror, made sure my fan in the bathroom is on....nothing works.  If I place it under the running water it clears for a brief few seconds and then it is foggy again.  The only thing I got out of this was a nice hanger for my razor.  I will have to remember to take a dry washcloth with me in the shower if I intend to use this mirror.  I have been an avid Amazon shopper for years, but I just think the company is getting to big.  I have had several problems over the past year with either the product being inferior or shipping problems.  If anyone out there knows of another company similar to Amazon, I sure would like to know it as I live in a rural area and do a lot of online shopping.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, we have VERY hard water, so it has streaked something horrid after a few months use.  Not the product&#x27;s problem, but since I can&#x27;t use anything to clean the hard water stains off, I can&#x27;t give it any higher rating. I will say that using the double-sided sticky tape and metal hook keeps it from falling off the shower wall, which our previous mirror&#x27;s suction cup was notorious for, usually in the middle of the night...</li>
    <li> This mirror is as good as described. I will caution you to listen to the seller&#x27;s instructions on care. I have a cleaning person and forgot to tell them not to clean this, and they ended up scratching it. Treat it like you expensive sunglasses, clean with water and a tissue, and you have the perfect shower shaving solution (say that five times fast)</li>
    <li> I like the previous one I purchased from the same place better. It was square. This one started water spotting a few times after using and now you can hardly see in it. It has never been washed, only rinsed in the shower as directed, so I don&#x27;t know what happened this time? I haven&#x27;t ordered another one because it is getting a little expensive after buying 2 already.</li>
    <li> I have used the product for 8 months. It was easy to mount in a tile shower. It is used almost daily. I rarely write reviews, but this product is awesome.</li>
    <li> Product is exactly as described. After using it for the first week I went to clean it exactly as described in the instructions. Essentially, the instructions say to clean it as it were sunglasses. All I did was wash it with water than dry it off with a brand new lint free microfiber towel. The surface ended up getting completely scratched. If you get this mirror, do not attempt to dry it or clean it with any type of cloth because it will scratch it up. Other than that, it truly does not fog up and has great clarity....before I tried cleaning it.</li>
    <li> I liked this mirror at first, and read the literature which explained that you are to clean this mirror with only a soft cloth and no chemicals.  So I was disappointed when, after 1 week of use,  I used warm water and a tissue to clean the mirror, and just that easily there are permanent scratches.</li>
    <li> So far excellent product as well as superior follow up and instructions for use.</li>
    <li> Lasted only 2 weeks. This is real piece of garbage. Don&#x27;t fall for false reviews.</li>
    <li> I have tried many &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; shaving mirrors. So far this is the best. Just rinse it with water and wipe with your fingers and its clean. I liked it so much i bought two more for my sons.</li>
    <li> The mirror was fantastic for about a month or so, but this morning I jumped in the shower and it was like someone flipped a switch and the mirror no longer works foglessly.  It fogs up within seconds now, and the water beads up on the surface, as if there were some kind of treatment that&#x27;s just no longer coating the mirror.    I have no idea what kept it fogless originally, but whatever it is, the magic is gone, and this product is completely useless now.  I originally rated this 5 stars, but seeing as it&#x27;s now just a paperweight, it&#x27;s down to 1. :(</li>
    <li> Over two months in and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. It&#x27;s still fogless (I don&#x27;t do more than splash some water on it to clear stray droplets) and I just bought one for my son who finally decided that shaving in the shower was a good thing. And the razor hook has turned out to a very welcome bonus.</li>
    <li> Works great. I&#x27;ve only had it 3 days.</li>
    <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED  I&#x27;ve had the mirror for several months. For the first few weeks it worked very well and then slowly it got worse and worse.  No cleaning solution was used on it as per the directions, only cleaned with water.  It now performs like any play old mirror that I could have used for a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> Works great so far but does fog a little...</li>
    <li> I got this mirror for my husband and he used it twice and wiped it said he had troubles seeing and it scratched. Wish it came with a cloth to use that wouldn&#x27;t scratch it.</li>
    <li> arrived without all the parts. (missing hooks)</li>
    <li> I installed this about mid-September and used it only a couple of times before leaving on a week long business trip. When I returned, this mirror began to fog slightly after just a few days of showering with it installed. (Note: It is not in direct contact with shower spray and only gets wet from over spray.) My wife threw the box away after a few days of opening and before I had installed it. If I had the box, I would have returned this item. It isn&#x27;t worth a dollar bill.&lt;br /&gt;Lately I just discovered that  rubbing some left over Gillette shaving gel onto the mirror and then rinsing it off after a minute or two that it would not fog up but just be covered in droplets. I may try to use some Rain-X or Fog-X on it to see if this can be salvaged.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot believe all the great reviews. They must have been written during the first few days of use.</li>
    <li> Works as promised. Easy installation, mounts easily, light weight, nice size and so far....fog-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased.</li>
    <li> works great and is very light weight so I&#x27;m not worried about dropping it and it breaking.</li>
    <li> Works great....low profile.</li>
    <li> working  perfectly.....is adhering well in shower, perfect.....no fog...husband loves it for shaving!!</li>
    <li> I used this for a couple of weeks. At first it was great. Then it started to become harder to see anything as water spots began to build up.    I decided to clean it using just water and a soft microfiber cloth as described in the manual. Long story short, the mirror is no longer fogless.    UPDATE: After noticing my comment, the company sent me a replacement mirror. This new mirror lasted exactly 2 showers before losing its \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; ability. This time it was not due to cleaning or anything else. I have no idea how this item is so highly ranked. Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> Second review: Difficult to see. It may be fogless but it isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;waterless&amp;#34; I have discontinued using it since it is worthless to me.</li>
    <li> Wonderful for shaving in shower guys.  !!!</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband to replace a &amp;#34;fogless &amp;#34; mirror that was nothing but fog in the steamy shower.&lt;br /&gt;This mirror is truly amazing...it REALLY is fogless !!!!  A very welcome addition to his shaving routine.&lt;br /&gt;He &amp;#34;loves it&amp;#34; and says it is &amp;#34;clear as can be!&amp;#34;. Thanks, Cassani  Co.!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love it...works as advertised...</li>
    <li> First fogless shower mirror I&#x27;ve bought that works as promised. Even the adhesive hooks it comes with are high quality. Great value for the money</li>
    <li> Very disappointing performance.  It has a weird slime on it that comes off quickly.  Then it fogs up.</li>
    <li> Totally fogless, I have purchased many shower mirrors over the years, this is simply the best one.</li>
    <li> This mirror fogged over within 5 minutes in the shower. You have to splash water on it to clear off the fog. It&#x27;s pretty much like every mirror in that way. I use these reviews to make purchase decisions, and my decision is that I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice mirror with simple hardware to mount the mirror and a razor (using sticky pads that adhere to the tile).  The mirror, though, fogs up every time if the water is any warmer than tepid.  Was hoping for something that truly wouldn&#x27;t fog up.</li>
    <li> Really Excellent Mirror!! A Best Buy! Exactly as advertised!</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised--a fogless shower mirror.  It&#x27;s a simple mirrored oval, about 8 inches tall and 6 inches wide, with a small cutout at the top to hang it on the included stainless adhesive-backed hook.  It also comes with a stainless adhesive-backed razor holder.  The mirror face shows water spots/residue after a few uses, but they disappear after a few seconds under warm water.  All-in-all, a good product.</li>
    <li> Plain and simple, it&#x27;s a good mirror the crap about &amp;#34;nanotechnology&amp;#34; is bull and a bit disrespectful. It will fog and when it does pick up some rainx anti fog and that will make it stop fogging again.</li>
    <li> This purchase was made by my husband and he says the mirror is working very well. He installed in the shower with little effort &amp; says that so far it has not fogged at all. Thank you for your product &amp; interest in how it has worked out!</li>
    <li> Very good little mirror.  Terrific that it doesn&#x27;t hang on suction cups which always fail, but definitely follow the directions and give the adhesive on the backside of the mirror hook and razor hook time to set.  If you do, you won&#x27;t have any worries about the mirror falling.  Because it is technically hanging from a hook, it hangs nice and plumb without any warping of the image and faces directly at you, whereas with suction cup held mirrors, sometimes the mirror surface flexes because of the contour of your shower wall.  That doesn&#x27;t happen with this mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews on the potential for scratching and quite frankly I have just avoided touching it at all.  I have had it for about 3 weeks or so and it hasn&#x27;t fogged once  or needed to be cleaned and has been hit with the shower sprayer a couple of times with no ill affect.  I would recommend this mirror and if you have kids (I have 6) who use that shower, hang it high and tell them how easily it can scratch.  Mine have left it alone.</li>
    <li> Anti-fog only lasted a few months before just acting like a regular mirror. It fogs up before the glass on the shower door does now.  The hooks for mounting the mirror and razor are indeed quick and easy to setup and seem to last, but that&#x27;s not what I bought this for.</li>
    <li> Works well enough. Got sort of a film to it after a while, but still works fine. Would not give up shaving in the shower for the world, by the way. Getting great mileage even from my cheap razors.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what I need it to. Simple to hang and stays unfogged while being used in the shower.</li>
    <li> Worked nice when I first got it... for a few weeks or so all was well. By the end of the first month, it seemed like a few little &amp;#34;spots&amp;#34; decided to form on the mirror, where water seems to stick like glue, not a big deal though; just splash some water on and all is well. Another month after that and now the mirror is covered in these spots that water sticks to, I have to wipe the mirror off with my hand and then rinse it off with water every time before using it now. This is only two months after purchase. I have never touched it with any cleaner, any cloth, nothing has ever touched this mirror except for air, water, and my (clean, soap-free) hand, and yet it can not seem to maintain the same level of non-water-magnetism as the hundreds of wall tiles behind it that it&#x27;s mounted on... ever think of just making ceramic reflective? Seems like that would work much better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted a shower mirror for shaving that I could both hold in my hand and put on the shower wall, didn&#x27;t fog up after 5 seconds (bonus if it just didn&#x27;t fog up at all), and was large enough so I could see a decent amount of my face at one time. I had come to the conclusion that these three qualities being present in a single product must be unreasonable. After nearly 15 years of shaving in the shower I still hadn&#x27;t found a mirror that didn&#x27;t have at least one of the qualities missing. Most are worse than that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still in awe. I have finally found such a mirror. As you might notice from the box it is nothing more than a mirror hanging up on a metal hook. This makes going from holding it to hanging it up simple and easy. I placed it fairly close to the path of the water stream and I have yet to see a fog form. And when on the hook it&#x27;s large enough to see everything I am shaving on my neck and face at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to anything else I&#x27;ve ever owned, I give this thing a 10/10 (or 5 stars or whatever).</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as he frequently shaves in the shower. I got to tell you he loves it and I love it too. It is so clear and there is absolutely no problem seeing what you are shaving in the mirror.  What a great  product. I am actually thinking of buying another one just to have it hear for my guest bathroom.  5 star product and the manufacturer also sends you an email explaining how to properly clean it to make it last a long time.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Was looking for a mirror that attached to the shower head... Not willing to pay $99 for one so I bought this instead.  Just a simple little mirror with a coating that keeps it fog proof.  Does exactly what it says it does.... Works well for me.</li>
    <li> Works well as long as you don&#x27;t ever wipe the mirror. Once you do, you&#x27;ll find you&#x27;ll most likely scratch the &amp;#34;nano&amp;#34; surface and ruin it for good. Otherwise, works well and is easy to maintain. If you&#x27;re worried about scratching it, I&#x27;d highly recommend a version where you fill up the reservoir in the back of the mirror (see my other review).</li>
    <li> My husband was delighted to have this shower mirror.  He says it works great and I felt it was an excellent buy.  The company sent him a couple of e-mails providing extra tips on how to use the mirror.  Look no further, get this mirror.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> 1 star for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. kept fogging-up. had to constantly rinse it as i was shaving.&lt;br /&gt;2. the hook actually fell-off about 3 hours after a very long first shower and shave. maybe i didn&#x27;t wait long enough for the adhesive to stick, but it was a few hours before i finally got in there. i did prep the tile area with rubbing alcohol and the dried it w/clean paper towels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hoping somebody from cassani see&#x27;s this review and responds. i am wanting this to work. it was great to shave agin in the shower. i has stopped doing that. even with all the hassle (until the hook fell off) i was ok w/the constant fogging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cassani you there?</li>
    <li> Great Product, it works as it was advertised</li>
    <li> Great mirror, doesn&#x27;t fog and I get a better shave being in a hot shower. I&#x27;m diggin it for sure - get yourself one people.</li>
    <li> I rarely review on Amazon and am skeptical of most others. For a $15 shower mirror I figured there isn&#x27;t a lot of fraudulent reviews. Let me just say this. After 1 week I LOVE you this mirror. Just the right size, CRYSTAL clear and works as advertised. I just hang it up and do nothing else. If it starts to fog just a quick blast of water and poof clear again. I have gone through 4 mirrors in 10 years. I will be hard pressed to buy anything other than this if I ever have to. This is a great gift for guys too. FYI. I had $100 in Amzon Gift cards and this is by far my favorite item from all Christmas. Thank you for the great product and fast shipping. Great job!!! You have earned a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> clear reflection; not distorted, doesn&#x27;t fog, good/strong adhesive hook and great price!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve had this mirror up in our shower for 2 weeks. Followed all the directions and haven&#x27;t cleaned it. The &amp;#34;no fog&amp;#34; finish on it is already coming off. Now the mirror looks like it&#x27;s melting because the no fog layer is sticky and is dripping off the mirror. Can&#x27;t even use it anymore because you can&#x27;t see yourself. Not happy at all.</li>
    <li> So far so good!  We&#x27;ve had this over a month and it has yet to fog.</li>
    <li> Works great.  gets a little fogged up now and then but a quick pass with the shower stream and it&#x27;s clear again.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to use this mirror but the coating must be cheap because it began to fog very soon. I would look elsewhere!!</li>
    <li> Okay, I&#x27;ve purchased 2 of these now. The first one was fantastic and it lasted about a year before I made the mistake of trying to clean it with toothpaste (I know it was dumb). I bought it again because the first time the mirror was perfectly flat and the anti fog feature worked great as long as you followed the directions and warmed it up in the shower stream first. I live in Florida and don&#x27;t have a water softener so I don&#x27;t knock off any points (stars) for the mirror needing cleaning. We have hard water and the fact that it lasted a year before getting any spots is actually a testament to how well this thing was made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for the bad news. The SECOND one I purchased was horrible! The mirror was warbled/distorted and the anti fog feature was non-existent. After a couple of days I saw a tiny, thin, film start to peel from the surface of the mirror. I can only assume that this is the anti fog &amp;#34;coating&amp;#34;.(?) And before anyone suggests this; No, it was not the &amp;#34;protective&amp;#34; plastic coating that ships with it. Right now I&#x27;m going on the premise that there was a bad production run maybe because it seems odd that I had 2 completely different experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company was great about refunding my money and I will give it another shot with a third one. I will return here and update with my review of the third one!</li>
    <li> Excellent, simple and works; this is my second purchase of one of these mirrors for the shower.  I added one to the guest bath.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this. The mirror fogs up everytime.</li>
    <li> Makes a shower shave much safer :)</li>
    <li> Works pretty good. Not 100% fog proof, but decent for the price. Looks nice and hangs easy. Does get water on surface</li>
    <li> Works great. My husband loves it since he doesn&#x27;t have to get out of the shower to shave anymore. If you follow the directions carefully for installation this will stay up without issue and if you don&#x27;t rub it with a towel or something else and just rinse it like it says it will not fog. Great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> Does the job as promised. The one drawback is that once it&#x27;s mounted on the shower wall it&#x27;s very difficult to detach and place elsewhere. So make sure it&#x27;s mounted where you want it to go.</li>
    <li> It is an ok mirror but it still fogs up in the shower.</li>
    <li> The mirror does not perform as suggested. I have to repeatedly run the mirror under water to keep it from fogging up.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving in the shower for many years.  Always had trouble with fog; had to keep splashing water on the makeup mirror to see my face.  After one week of use with the Fogless Shower Mirror, I am a believer.  This is truly an amazing product.  Hanged it opposite right shoulder out of shower spray and, so far, no fog whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tsum</li>
    <li> Really cool style, modern and easy to set-up. Going to buy another for the guest bathroom shower.</li>
    <li> This exactly what I wanted as ordered. I would order again if looking for another shower mirror.</li>
    <li> This mirror is NOT fogless! It&#x27;s simply a mirror.  Fogs up instantly in the shower.</li>
    <li> Does for sure fog in the shower... may be better than others, but I wouldn&#x27;t consider it fogless.</li>
    <li> Gave to husband and sons for Christmas. Already have to replace.</li>
    <li> Okay, the whole &amp;#34;nano&amp;#34; thing is malarkey.  Run the mirror under the hot water, the temperature of the mirror equalizes to the temp of your shower and doesn&#x27;t fog up.  Stayed fog free for maybe 3 uses before I had to start running under the water.  No big deal.</li>
    <li> 2nd purchase of this mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic for shaving in the Shower!</li>
    <li> This is not permanent. The mirror has a layer preventing fog from forming but eventually it got worn out less than 1month.</li>
    <li> I purchased this two months ago 12/17/2014 and the protective coating that prevents if from fogging up has already failed.  The product worked well for perhaps a month.</li>
    <li> After about 2 days the mirror fogged up! How is this the &amp;#34;HIGHEST RATED foggless shower mirror&amp;#34;???  I hung the morror in the back of my shower as suggested, I NEVER wiped the mirror with anything, and still it fogs up! and the stupid hooks for the mirror and razor are stuck in my shower now....  Save your $ and look elsewhere!</li>
    <li> Works well and looks nice. Had it in shower for a week or so. The back of the mirror it&#x27;s covered with what looks to be cardboard. I&#x27;m concerned it won&#x27;t hood up.</li>
    <li> Easy to assemble and mount. Definitely stays put and stays fog free. Husband loves it to shave in the shower. A must have for any guy who shaves frequently in the shower or if your a women who removes your makeup in the shower to be sure all of your eye makeup is removed! Great product!</li>
    <li> Lasted about 2 weeks. Never cleaned with any rag or cleaner (as it suggests not to), now it fogs repeatedly. They must of changed their product judging by earlier 5-star reviews.</li>
    <li> Great Product!!! Was wondering why I haven&#x27;t shaved in the shower all these years. Product does fog up but a little rinse in the hot water will clear it up for a few minutes for you to finish up shaving. Easy to Install also.</li>
    <li> Great for shaving in shower!!!!</li>
    <li> I have to tell this story, because customer service is my forte. The Cassani Company actually reached out to me via email and admitted there may be a problem with their product, &amp;#34;an error in production&amp;#34; they said. So now my radar was up, was this product really worth the $15.00 (plus shipping)?&lt;br /&gt;After receiving that first shipment, they were correct -- fog city, not even two minutes into my shower. I let the company rep know via email and just four days later I received my replacement mirror. So during my morning shower I purposely let the steam build up and I&#x27;ll be a nanotechnologist... NO FOG whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be sure to follow the care instructions and never let a towel or wash rag come near this thing. My Shower Tek mirror (with the water running through it to prevent steam build up) was the absolute bomb for about seven years, until corrosion got the better of it. I couldn&#x27;t find a replacement for the Shower Tek, so I only hope this product lasts half as long as its predecessor. I&#x27;m a happy camper Cassani!!</li>
    <li> Worst product ever!!!! Don&#x27;t buy it gets fogged right away Never worked</li>
    <li> I was optimistic about this mirror but it fogs up within 2-3 minutes of the shower being on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not as impressed with this as I had hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;1) the mirror seems to fog up just as frequently as the one I replaced&lt;br /&gt;2) the pointy metal hook they include to hang the mirror now that it&#x27;s installed seems danger to have in a shower. I&#x27;m terrified that I am going to slip and it will impale me. (paranoid and stupid I know) This is easily remedied thought I think I would add a string around the mirror and hang the hook higher up... possibly completely out of the shower stall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;1) SUPER lightweight&lt;br /&gt;2) crystal clear - the firs time I looked in this thing it felt like high def&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tons of e-mails on proper care and use after purchase felt spammy. I read the instructions and know exactly how they recommend to care for this product. I don&#x27;t need daily reminders.</li>
    <li> What do you think of mirrors in the shower? Do you use them? Now thank god as I have aged I have not started to sprout a beard - yet! However I love having a mirror on hand when I put hair dye on while sitting in the tub. Needless to say most of the time I end up with red dye on my ears, by my cheeks and just about anywhere it should not be. Taking a mirror along was useless since it would always fog up anyways, until I was send the Fogless Shower Mirror by Cassani to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, hello there! The mirror has some sort of anti-fog nanotechnology  that prevents the mirror from fogging up. The mirror is send with a stainless steel mirror wall hook, a wall razor holder and of course the mirror itself. I hate suction cups and thankfully adhesive pads are send that actually work quiet well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised to see that the mirror barely fogged up. While testing it I really had to just have extremely hot water running in order to see it slightly fog up. Under normal shower and bathing conditions it did not fog up and I liked it so much that I am going to buy an extra one for my husbands shower.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I have used a ShowerTek mirror for years and I decided it was time for an upgrade. This mirror does not require attachment to the shower head and is aesthetically more pleasing.  The design is great with simple brushed metal hook attachments.  Installation takes 5 minutes .  I have had none of the problems with fogging noted in other reviews.  Cleaning just involves rInsing under the shower. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> How is this fog-less? From the first time I used it, this thing fogged up, so I don&#x27;t understand the raving reviews, unless, of course, I got a dud. Anyway, mine is NOT fog-less at all. Also, way overpriced for what it is.</li>
</ol>
