      <li>I liked the tingling sensation I got, which made me feel the product was working on my scalp.</li>
      <li>I deducted a star from the rating because it honestly won&#x27;t \\&quot;grow\\&quot; hair.</li>
      <li>I know the regaine so far worked the best for me.</li>
      <li>The most beneficial product is the foam which is included in this pack.</li>
      <li>I wasnt sure if this product was for women or men though I wish they would have specified that more.</li>
      <li>I feel it&#x27;s better than using a store bought shampoo that does not include ingredients that promote health growth.</li>
      <li>Also seem to have more volume and visibly looks thicker</li>
      <li>and I forget it&#x27;s even in there except that I feel like my hair looks better.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really tell if this is helping my hair grow but the product us a great shampoo</li>
      <li>I have used the Nioxin products, and all of these are better, in my opinion, than the Nioxin comparisons, including the leave-in conditioner.  </li>
      <li>so I am extremely satisfied&#x27;</li>
      <li>You may have better luck</li>
      <li>and like there was more there.</li>
      <li>But I do feel that I have to wash my hair more often.  </li>
      <li>I cannot afford to have the hair transplant, so I&#x27;ll use this product until I cannot afford it anymore and it looks as if I&#x27;ll get better looking hair.</li>
      <li>The shampoo and conditioner are just ok.  </li>
      <li>I purchased it because of the reviews for my dad who is thinning on the top.  </li>
      <li>I love this product</li>
      <li>If you want to continually buy this product maybe it would be better for you</li>
      <li>Like many reviewers here, I made the switch to Bosley after I noticed that Nioxin changed its formulation.</li>
      <li>and I love the softness and sheen.</li>
      <li>All it did was make my hair brittle and break even more.</li>
      <li>I thought this product would help hair loss and keep hair looking and feeling healthy like it claims.</li>
      <li>, my hair still feels healthy</li>
      <li>I used this product for 60+ day, my hair was thinning at the top</li>
      <li>(She had recommended this and product and said she has seen it help many men)</li>
      <li>I can safely say that it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>but I did order more after I ran out.  </li>
      <li>I gave bosley a try even though there was not that many reviews at the time, with my start date of march</li>
      <li>Anyway, one more update to come after month 3!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s quite refreshing.</li>
      <li>By the way, it&#x27;s also important to keep your head up and not stress about this kind of stuff.</li>
      <li>im glad.</li>
      <li>May need to buy more.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going to give this stuff one more month</li>
      <li>Plan to order more when needed.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this is probably all in my mind, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this set.</li>
      <li>After reading so many great reviews, I had high hopes for this product.  </li>
      <li>Shampoo and conditioner make my hair feel clean and they do make the scalp tingle, which feels nice.</li>
      <li>Good but not as good as Nioxin in my opinion only</li>
      <li>Then when I used the thicking treatment right after, I could immediately feel my hair more thicker than ever!</li>
      <li>Excellent product and arrived on time as expected.</li>
      <li>I rarely use hair wax anymore as my hair already has the volume to stand on its own.</li>
      <li>Great product with super fast shipping.  </li>
      <li>They make your scalp and  hair feel clean and healthy.</li>
      <li>The Bosley mousse gives my fine hair body and fullness</li>
      <li>The shampoo and mousse seem to be fine.</li>
      <li>I am so glad I tried this product, because it has helped me tremendously.</li>
      <li>and I can tell a huge difference.  </li>
      <li>This is primarily on account of the foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
      <li>and my hair looks 100% filled in after 30 days..</li>
      <li>Plus I have two family members who are now using it and have experienced the same results.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t remember the last time my scalp felt this great.</li>
      <li>I will not be purchasing again, and for what it&#x27;s worth, I have now fallen in love with Carol&#x27;s Daughter Minoi shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>To me, conditioners should detangle and smooth hair.</li>
      <li>product works great for those with thinning hair who want their hair to look and appear full for an event (wedding, etc.), but should only be used as a one time basis.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>originally tried out Bosley&#x27;s Defense Starter pack.</li>
      <li>On the bright side, the same starter kit has lasted me until now.</li>
      <li>I should start off by saying that I&#x27;m a male in my mid-twenties, I&#x27;m in good health</li>
      <li>The shampoo amount is good for short hair and compare to Conditioner you will run out quicker.</li>
      <li>I have had such good results that I no longer need to use the Thickening Treatment at all.  </li>
      <li>He said his wife and him both use it and he has a full head of hair.</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t see yet much differences in hair growth (maybe if I use more days it will work).</li>
      <li>Like others have written, this product won&#x27;t grow a full head of hair.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This actually makes your hair fall out!  The volumizer basically damages your hair follicle which makes your hair look fuller at the time and then as the hair follicle weakens causes your hair to fall out.&lt;br /&gt;This product works great for those with thinning hair who want their hair to look and appear full for an event (wedding, etc.), but should only be used as a one time basis.&lt;br /&gt;This product should never be used on a daily basis to revitalize hair growth!</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews and thought it was going to work. I&#x27;ve been using it for little over a month and nothing yet. I&#x27;m a Caucasian female and im thinning out really bad and this stuff isn&#x27;t working. Good luck!</li>
    <li> I have medium to thin thickness/hair. It is straight and manageable. My hair is not in need of any styling products. I recently cut about 12 inches of my hair, because I noticed that I was losing a lot of it. I&#x27;m not sure if the cutting made a difference. Hair still comes out during showering and occasionally on my clothes and pillow, but since it&#x27;s shorter, it&#x27;s not as bothersome I guess. I purchased this set after a recommendation from a friend. I liked the tingling sensation I got, which made me feel the product was working on my scalp. However, even with shoulder-length hair, the shampoo and conditioner tangled my hair badly. To me, conditioners should detangle and smooth hair. However, this did not do either. It bothered me so much that I felt like I was losing more hair in the shower than I should, due to trying to get the product through my tangled hair. I will not be purchasing again, and for what it&#x27;s worth, I have now fallen in love with Carol&#x27;s Daughter Minoi shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> seems to be new growth and thicker hair</li>
    <li> Been using this product for a month now, it helped my dandruff significantly, and my hair doesnt get as greasy after a day of washing it, those are the only reasons i like it, however it has done nothing for hair regrowth, and im still losing as much hair as before using this product. Because this product does not seem to hold up to what it says it can do, i think it should come down in price.</li>
    <li> If I could give this no stars I would. I bought these products based on all of the great reviews.&lt;br /&gt;All these items did was accelerate my hair loss and made it fall out more, at an alarming rate!&lt;br /&gt;Not only did it not help, it made my thinning much worse. Perhaps Bosley does work for some&lt;br /&gt;people. But, it definitely did not work for me. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> YOU ARE PRETTY MUCH GOING TO GET A TRAVERS SIZE KIT FOR 20 BUCKS! WTF IS THIS IN THIS THAT COSTS SO MUCH!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say if it really helped my hair grow but I do feel it is very healthy for my thining hair. I like all three products and feel they work best when used together.</li>
    <li> Not Yet ... but I&#x27;m waiting</li>
    <li> This product is marvelous. It has menthol in it so it tingles the scalp and immediately forms the mindset that it is working. The itching and red blotches on my scalp are gone. My hair no longer falls out by the handfuls during the day. Three weeks later, there is noticeable fine hair growth at the hair line and on top of my scalp. My hair looks healthier than it has in months; it shines, has more volume, and the natural curl is coming back. I will purchase these products individually in their full sizes.</li>
    <li> I have dry eye problems after I started to use this junk for 2 weeks, I had some kind of reaction. I have dry eyes now for over 1.5 years, 4 doctors and 17 appointments later after using the Bosley Shampoo for 2 weeks. got to a point where I couldn&#x27;t drive until I stopped it for 4 days. If I could turn anything back in my life, that would be using this.</li>
    <li> I used this product for 60+ day, my hair was thinning at the top so I decided I  would try something out and i tried this product out. I followed all the direction and was consistent with using this, I let my hair grow as i was using it an cut it twice during the process. The person that cuts my hair said that they say hair that in the top back of my head growing towards the front. I am now finish with it and My verdict is it depend of the person hair type, it seen a little diffidence just not as much as i believe i would. if this review helps anybody im glad. Would i buy this again no. i am going to try another product my family suggested and its the same price.</li>
    <li> good product, haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see results yet. it has made my hair seem to be thicker.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because my hair was at the point of no return..or so i thought..i hadnt noticed how much i had truly thinned on the back, and crown/top of my head. I had been shaving my head once a week with the clippers #1 setting to keep it thin but it was looking like i&#x27;d have to use a bic razor to make it look good. My fiancee convinced me to buy this.  I was skeptical and a lot of reviews here said took 3 months for results. well i doubt these people keep their hair as thing as i do.. I started seeing results within a few weeks.. in under 3 weeks it was noticeable.. even my mother and family i dont see all the time was like wow your hair looks thicker..its growing back!  The areas with hair have noticeably thickened and i&#x27;ve actually sprouted new hairs in teh thinning areas..especially the top..  the back crown is taking longer to fill in but its filling and i have not lost any new hair.  I&#x27;ve taken pics along the way and i&#x27;ll see if i can attach them.  Today is my 30th day and I missed a day or 2 in between but its definitely noticeable.. My confidence starting rising just under 3 weeks.  I also put hte treatment on in the morning before a trip to disneyland and spent all day in the sun. I grew like a chia pet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to use this product til it runs out(still have another months worth left of the shampoo and conditioner) and also buy when its gone.  5 stars!!!!! A+++&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit: shaved my head today after i took pictures and my hair looks 100% filled in after 30 days..you can&#x27;t even tell i was ever severely balding/thinning other than my receded temples where obviously hair cannot grow back.</li>
    <li> I guess i don&#x27;t understand why there was tape on the cap.It almost seems to me that my bottles were used</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend who had a bout with halitosis.  It really helped stop his hair from falling out further and then helped it to grow back faster.  Great product with super fast shipping.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I am already impressed with this product! After only three washes my hair has stopped falling out and I can brush it without the fear of a lot of hair coming out. I will continue using this! I hope to see new hair growth soon!</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t seen any results</li>
    <li> I have not used this product long enough to know whether it will do all that it claims, but already my husband says my hair looks fuller and I love the softness and sheen.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work! Burns your skull and you start loosing more hair faster! Don&#x27;t buy find something else!! Use with caution!!!</li>
    <li> like the fullness after using to thinning hair</li>
    <li> Personally, since buying it, I haven&#x27;t seen any hair regrowth (not that I expected to). After the 2 month mark, the &amp;#34;hair falling out in the shower&amp;#34; symptom has dwindled, though not a lot. Shampoo and conditioner make my hair feel clean and they do make the scalp tingle, which feels nice. The foam whatever-it-is just irritates the scalp for a little bit, but obviously has a minor thickening effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy it thinking your hair is going to grow back. You&#x27;ll get clean feeling hair that is slightly thicker.</li>
    <li> It definitely makes your hair look and feel thicker. However, there was no new hair growth, other than some small buds that appeared in my widow&#x27;s peak. I used it for 5 months, so I&#x27;m on the fence about ordering it again.</li>
    <li> So for the past 2 years my hair has been slowly falling out especially on the top of my head(Im young,very healthy,in my mid 20&#x27;s, male), with my hairline receding Ive tried various brands including nioxin, which actually made my hair fall out more. I gave bosley a try even though there was not that many reviews at the time, with my start date of march I began using the shampoo every other day, the conditioner every day and the nourish pump every morning and evening. My hair line slowly started coming back with itty bitty hairs at first but on top of my head I still saw a lack of hair. now my hair line is 80% back with more itty bitty hairs growing in the remaining area and the previous small hair now thick and long. The top of my head has finally also started showing signs of growing back. Many shampoos always dried my hair and scalp but this product leaves my hair feeling soft and healthy. It worked really really well for me. If you try it, it may work but give it a few months(3-6 months) to see big change, there is no instant overnight cure for hairloss.&lt;br /&gt;CHEERS!</li>
    <li> Uh...over 1 month and ZERO improvements. Still losing hair. I&#x27;m very upset about this product.</li>
    <li> My husband has using this for about a month and there is definitely a noticeable difference. He is young (mid 20&#x27;s) and just started noticing a receding hair line. This is the first hair growth product he has tried and there is definitely improvement. Even his hairdresser asked him what he had been doing different since she noticed baby hairs growing in. (She had recommended this and product and said she has seen it help many men) Definitely worth a try if you are considering it. They are small bottles but he still has a ton left.</li>
    <li> Hair seems thicker after use</li>
    <li> does help a lot  even helps with dandruff I have no words only that you should try it  you wont regret it</li>
    <li> I have been using this awesome product for over two weeks now. I don&#x27;t know about the regrowth of hair, but my hair stopped falling. Also, it stopped the dandruff, which is a major step in my life, from the first time of using it.</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner are just ok.  The treatment leaves your hair sticky and dull.  I was very disappointed in the products.</li>
    <li> Great product,,very satisfied with it..thanks</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really tell if this is helping my hair grow but the product us a great shampoo and it is void of a lot of the dangerous chemicals in a lit of shampoos.</li>
    <li> Shampoo has a nice tingling effect &amp; the conditioner is cooling (reminds me of getting my hair washed at the salon). The ingredients consist of natural products so it&#x27;s not a prescription medication like Propecia (which give me back pain so I started taking before bed time so I wouldn&#x27;t feel the affects). I feel it&#x27;s better than using a store bought shampoo that does not include ingredients that promote health growth. Having the Bosley name is just a bonus. The most beneficial product is the foam which is included in this pack. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about a month so it is a little early to be certain of its effectiveness.  However, I do think I am finding fewer hairs in the shower.  I probably will continue using it regardless because I like the products.  It takes just a little dab of the shampoo to lather and the rinse out conditioner and the leave in conditioner make my hair feel fuller.  I have recommended it to all of my friends who have a thinning problem.</li>
    <li> This product makes your hair soft and very fluffy. The package arrived promptly and in great condition. The tingly sensation is great.</li>
    <li> Not trying to lie or hype this product but I will start off by saying everybody around me tells me I&#x27;m just paranoid and I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;Not thinning at all. Been around 3 weeks and I&#x27;m noticing less hair in my hand in the shower. Also seem to have more volume and visibly looks thicker I can&#x27;t seen any scalp or anything! Now thin or not the lack of hair falling out is a visible improvement so I am extremely satisfied&#x27;</li>
    <li> I actually feel my hair is thicker.  I have reordered a standard supply.  But I do feel that I have to wash my hair more often.  My hair has gotten thin with age and this product works for me.</li>
    <li> My head was itching itensely and I had bald spots forming on the front and back of my head prior to using this product. My doctor assumed it was stress induced, but was unsure exactly what the cause was. I have been using this product for 1.5 months, and the itch is GONE. Not only is the itch gone, but my hair is growing back, and does not get as greasy as it once did. I can&#x27;t remember the last time my scalp felt this great. I am so glad I tried this product, because it has helped me tremendously.</li>
    <li> In My opinion it doesn&#x27;t work but if Your problem is psychological and You need to feel like You are doing something to keep whatever hair you have left then go for it.</li>
    <li> I like Rogaine to tell you the truth..this product works slowly..not sure how really effective it is. Thanks! I appreciate your business!</li>
    <li> It has stopped hair loss and that is  good enough for me. My hair looks fuller and it is the action Of both the shampoo and the treatment. I am on my second bottle and loving it. I even sent a bottle to my sister.</li>
    <li> Was a very good product still using it. you can feel it working after the first use. Not sure if it will cure or regrow hair but willing to give it a shot.</li>
    <li> I tried this product for 6wks and saw relatively no change in hair loss. I would normally lose about 20 strands of hair each shower and this product didn&#x27;t help any. It makes your hair smell good and the conditioner gives it a tingle. For that I would much rather spend less money on Head and Shoulders. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it because it didn&#x27;t slow my hair loss at all after using it for nearly two months.</li>
    <li> I will be ordering again. Great product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and arrived on time as expected. I would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Gave to my mom as a gift that she requested. She says that she likes it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Bosley shampoo/condition kit for a few years. I use it daily and I have to admit that I see little to know hair strands in the shower now when compared to when I was using random supermarket shampoos. I also do believe that my hair is thicker as well. According to some research hair loss is attributed to DHT. Bosley shampoo is to remove the DHT thereby preventing hair loss. Try it for awhile. You have to wash your hair anyway, might as well give this a try and if it doesn&#x27;t work for you at least you tried. But I refuse to change as I see this product working for me.</li>
    <li> In fairness, I did like it and thought it was starting to thicken my hair but then my scalp broke out. I had to go to a dermatologist for treatment and was forced to stop using this product. If you&#x27;re not allergic to the ingredients, it may be just the thing for you.</li>
    <li> Like others have written, this product won&#x27;t grow a full head of hair.  But it has STOPPED my thinning hair from getting thinner.  My hair used to fall out copiously.  It doesn&#x27;t do that anymore.  I have used this product for about two years and I won&#x27;t give it up.  Plus I have two family members who are now using it and have experienced the same results.  I deducted a star from the rating because it honestly won&#x27;t \\&quot;grow\\&quot; hair.</li>
    <li> Not worth buying. Instead buy the Walmart Brand (Equate) Rogain for superior results! It took 3 months, but hair is actually coming back and it&#x27;s a lot simpler than using 3 products vs 1.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell any difference. May need to buy more. I know the regaine so far worked the best for me. But Rogaine gives you a 3 month supply. This was about 2 months</li>
    <li> Have been using almost daily for two months and haven&#x27;t really seen substantial regrowth. I have however noticed slightly less hair loss.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any hair improvement :-(&lt;br /&gt;Hair feels decent but I haven&#x27;t seen any hair restoration, I&#x27;m continuing using it and see what happens.</li>
    <li> So far, I&#x27;ve noticed no growth or thickening of my hair, nor any volume improvement by using this product.  Not yet used 30 days.</li>
    <li> I have been taking Bosley products for several months and its absolutely of no use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion is never go for Bosley products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> It did nothing like it says.  A pure waste of money.  Don&#x27;t spend your money on this product.  Sorry, sorry.</li>
    <li> I purchase this set after the successful result I&#x27;ve got with their hair supplement product. but unfortunately I did not notice any difference since I used the set. The shampoo amount is good for short hair and compare to Conditioner you will run out quicker. I have to say I loved the cold effect of the conditioner on skull after shower it&#x27;s quite refreshing.</li>
    <li> I gave it a try to use this product because the Nioxin shampoo ran out. The first day I used this product made my hair very drizzel and thin looking and after a week got even worst and my scalp itching like never, I dont know if this product works to certain people but not for me I was using Nioxing and it works great. Just now I returned this product.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a shampoo to replace the unfortunately discontinued Progaine. This combo is not that replacement.  The shampoo itself is adequate, but the combination of three products left my hair flat and dirty looking.  The exact opposite of what I would want!</li>
    <li> I think I see improvement on my husbands hair. It hasn&#x27;t been too long since he used it, but will see when he continues to keep up with it. I still have hopes that this treatment will work on him.</li>
    <li> Big waste of money.  Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> Not enough of the product to make any decisions on liking or not liking but I did order more after I ran out.  It does state that you won&#x27;t see results for at least six months and I am going into eight months with not much change.</li>
    <li> Wishing to see my hair stay in my head, not continue to fall out.  I like the thickening foam however.  I doubt that I will continue using this product.  I didn&#x27;t have any skin redness so that was not a factor.  Just was hoping to see some new growth but haven&#x27;t as yet.  I will use it to the last drop and keep praying that I get better results.</li>
    <li> Works very well in restoring hair or at least keeping it from falling out.  Had been using Nioxin but as they changed the formula, it caused hair to fall out in great amounts and become very thin.  So even though I had large bottles of unused Nioxin, I gave Bosley a try and it seems to have reversed the problem.  At least my hair isn&#x27;t falling out in huge amounts anymore.  I hope it continues to be a success.</li>
    <li> Starter Kit great for Traveling!</li>
    <li> I admit I have had a few health problems which has led to some noticeably thinning hair.  Though Bosley says that, with use of this item, hair will look noticeably fuller in 30 days, I bought TWO of these packages to allow it TWICE the amount of time to show any results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for a full 60 days the results were.... bupkes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only did my hair not look even slightly fuller, the conditioner left my hair more brittle with considerably more split ends than I had previously.  I&#x27;ve had far better luck with any of the biotin shampoos and conditioners from Avalon Organics, which are a fraction of the price.  I&#x27;ve also found that the [[ASIN:B006TUSOI0 TRESemme Split End Remedy Conditioner, 25 Fluid Ounce (Pack of 2)]] is helping manage the split ends that the Bosley products did to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is unfortunate.  After reading so many great reviews, I had high hopes for this product.  I guess for some people it simply doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Not for me but for my Mom who has been using this product for awhile but this price was the best.</li>
    <li> Have been using since May (6 mo) and don&#x27;t really see a difference in hair regrowth. Didn&#x27;t work for me. Useless product.</li>
    <li> I am 68.  After wearing my hair very short for 25 years, I decided to let it grow out 2 years ago. As it has, it has also grown much finer and thinner.  I asked my hair stylist what she thought of Nioxin, and she recommended  Bosley products instead.  I ordered the started kit and have been using both shampoo and conditioner for 7 weeks - I have had such good results that I no longer need to use the Thickening Treatment at all.  My hair looks beautiful, with lots of new growth apparent at my hairline.  i am recommending Bosley products to every one I know!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch, if it was expired, or if what was in the container wasn&#x27;t what it was suppose to be, but there was nothing I noticed any different than buying a $5 shampoo/conditioner</li>
    <li> Nice hair product. Have not noticed any visible change but I do agree with other reviews on the quality of the product, especially the conditioner (tingles on the scalp and smells great). I assume that is by design in that it&#x27;s stimulating the hair follicles. Don&#x27;t expect overnight growth but I suspect it should at least prevent hair loss. I have not seen as much hair in my sink lately come to think of it. Recommend.</li>
    <li> Like many reviewers here, I made the switch to Bosley after I noticed that Nioxin changed its formulation. My hair also started getting thinner again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally tried out Bosley&#x27;s Defense Starter pack. I used it for six months, but my hair did get a little thinner during this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then switched it up to this product. I&#x27;ve been using the Revive series for about four months now. Below are the pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Visibly thickens hair. I rarely use hair wax anymore as my hair already has the volume to stand on its own. This is primarily on account of the foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Simple three-step process. Not hard to learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Hair stopped falling out. This is the biggie. I rarely find strands of hair while shampooing anymore.  My hair loss has definitely halted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contras:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) No new growth. While my hair loss has halted, I&#x27;m not observing any new hair growth either. The crown of my head is still noticeably thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Pricey. The pack can be expensive for a lot of consumers. A pack typically lasts me about 2-3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: Since I&#x27;m not overally concerned about the thin hair on my crown, I gladly will continue using this product in order to prevent further hair loss. The thickening action of the foam clearly voluminizes the hair considerably, a great plus. If you&#x27;re visibly losing hair but just want to stop hair loss and aren&#x27;t too concerned about having your same hair like when you were a teen, I would definitely recommend this product over Nioxin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For women: the Defense Starter pack is a great way to thicken and add volume to your hair.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do a darn thing to my hair. Waist of money.</li>
    <li> I have been using these products for less than a month now and I can tell a huge difference.  Remarkable !!!</li>
    <li> It changed nothing but get worse. I don&#x27;t know what should I do now anymore.Could you give me some advices please?</li>
    <li> I love this set. I have used the Nioxin products, and all of these are better, in my opinion, than the Nioxin comparisons, including the leave-in conditioner.  The Nioxin mousse leaves my hair feeling like straw and I can&#x27;t wait to get it washed out.  The Bosley mousse gives my fine hair body and fullness and I forget it&#x27;s even in there except that I feel like my hair looks better.  UPDATE: 4-16-15: I&#x27;m lowering my rating from 5 stars down to 3 stars and going back to Nioxin for both shampoo and conditioner since they come in a set. The main reason is the Bosley Conditioner leaves my hair so tangled I can hardly get a comb through it later. Nioxin&#x27;s conditioner is superior in that I can literally run my fingers through my wet hair with no tangles. Nioxin&#x27;s Shampoo seems to be about comparable to Bosley. Both brands work well as in they do keep my hair from thinning due to my thyroid condition.     Bottom line is that I no longer can recommend Bosley Conditioner. The shampoo and mousse seem to be fine.</li>
    <li> The seller did a great job with getting us our product in time. It also was in great condition when we received it. The only complaint I have is that my husbands hair does not appear to be any better. We have been using the product for about a month now and I have not noticed any difference. If anything his hair looks thinner.</li>
    <li> -FINAL UPDATE-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok. I should start off by saying that I&#x27;m a male in my mid-twenties, I&#x27;m in good health and I live a semi-active lifestyle (I know, who cares? But apparently this stuff matters to some people). So take this review for what it&#x27;s worth to you. Like many of you I was torn between the positive and negative reviews, so I just said \\&quot;screw it\\&quot; and went ahead and bought the starter kit. My main hair concerns were my slowly progressing receding hairline (devil&#x27;s horns as we call them) and my generally thinner looking hair that comes with age. After using this starter kit as instructed and consistently (daily) for about one month now, I have found the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has this product made your hair grow back? Definitely not. I&#x27;m no Chia Pet, yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has this product stopped your hair from falling out? Possibly. But it&#x27;s not obvious enough to tell for certain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does your hair feel / look healthier and thicker? It definitely feels healthier and cleaner. Some days it looks thicker, and some days it looks thinner. I&#x27;m sure this is probably all in my mind, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you get your monies worth? Yes. You don&#x27;t need to use much shampoo or conditioner because it lathers up quite well. This was actually quite surprising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will you continue to buy and use this product? Yes, for three reasons. One, because I still have some left. Two, because I like the way it makes my hair feel (healthier). And three, because it has only been one month. I will probably use this product for three months before I make my ultimate decision on how it works for me. I will update this review every month along the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MONTH TWO:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, I&#x27;m here to update my review after about 60 days, as promised. This is going to be short and simple because well, not much has changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has definitely NOT made any noticeable \\&quot;regrowth\\&quot; and looks about the same as it did when I started two months ago. This could be a testimony to the product preventing further hair loss, however, it has still only been 60 days. How much hair can you possibly lose in two months that&#x27;s visible to the naked eye..?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair still feels healthy and blah blah blah, but we aren&#x27;t paying 30 bucks for a trial version of shampoo &amp; conditioner to say our hair feels healthy (especially if you&#x27;re a dude like me). Let&#x27;s be honest, we all want to have Afros as soon as we throw the stuff on our head. That&#x27;s not happening. On the bright side, the same starter kit has lasted me until now. Keep in mind I have short hair, but I really can&#x27;t complain about the price because its lasted longer then expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to give this stuff one more month and then I&#x27;ll probably call it quits and onto the next miracle shampoo. By the way, it&#x27;s also important to keep your head up and not stress about this kind of stuff. Remember that stress causes hair-loss and if you&#x27;re stressing yourself out about the product while using it, that probably defeats the purpose of using it in the first place. Anyway, one more update to come after month 3!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps- sorry that wasn&#x27;t short or sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MONTH 3 (FINAL REVIEW):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s been a little over three months since I started using this product (every day, as recommended) and I can safely say that it doesn&#x27;t work. When I say it doesn&#x27;t work, that means that it didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, my hair still feels healthy - Thanks Bosley, the little hair that&#x27;s left on my head thanks you for that. However, this product just simply did not work. It did not regrow any hair on my head, or make it look \\&quot;thicker\\&quot; in appearance. As a matter of fact, my hairline has actually receded a little further. Thanks Mother Nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I will NOT be purchasing this product again and I have no idea if it will work for anyone else. I still have a tad left, so if by some miracle I wake up looking like Chewbacca in the next few days, I&#x27;ll let you guys know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this 3-month review has helped at least a  few of you out in your purchasing decisions, and I wish you all the best of luck in the search for long, luscious hair. Sorry Bosley.e next few days, I&#x27;ll let you guys know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this 3-month review has helped at least a  few of you out in your purchasing decisions, and I wish you all the best of luck in the search for long, luscious hair. Sorry Bosley.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser said I should try using Bosley Revive Starter Pack for my very thinning hair. He said not to give up because it could take about 90 days to really see results. He said his wife and him both use it and he has a full head of hair. It&#x27;s only been about a month since I started using it and my hair does look fuller.  I was very depressed with my hair loss but now I feel I have hope.</li>
    <li> I tried this system as an alternative to the Nioxin system. I liked the shampoo and conditioner. They make your scalp and  hair feel clean and healthy. The main reason I tried the system was for the scalp treatment. This is applied after washing the  hair and before drying.  I applied before blow drying my hair and didn&#x27;t like the results. It felt limp and a little oily and It didn&#x27;t seem to thicken the hair like the Nioxin treatment. I quit using and ordered the Nioxin product I had been using before. One warning.....the Amazon description stated that the scalp treatment was 6.8 oz. It is actually is 3.4 oz. I tried to explain the problem to the supplier, Beauty King, but they didn&#x27;t seem smart enough to comprehend the problem. Gave up trying to explain to them the description as incorrect. It seems the same description is used by Amazon for all suppliers of the product, so it probably isn&#x27;t the fault of the individual supplier.</li>
    <li> The product does not work. I have been using the product for over 2 months and do not see any results.</li>
    <li> When I used it the first time I could feel the tingling sensation when I washed my hair with the shampoo/conditioner and it felt super clean. Then when I used the thicking treatment right after, I could immediately feel my hair more thicker than ever! I love this product already!...Then after using it more than 2 weeks it stopped working!  :(</li>
    <li> This product wasn&#x27;t for me...  It may work for others, but it did nothing for me.  I didn&#x27;t have high hopes that it would regrow hair, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to give me a painful rash on my scalp... :-(</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really give it an accurate rating of whether it works or not because its only been three days but when i do put it in it tingles and thats all i know</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this product. It didn&#x27;t do anything for my scalp. But everybody&#x27;s bodies completely different. You may have better luck</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Excellent transaction. Shipping and handling timely and cost effective. My hair appeared thicker and fuller with the very first use. I am looking forward to seeing how it is doing after 2-3 months. Plan to order more when needed.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend who is thinning and after a few weeks of using the product, his hair is getting thicker! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have very fine and dry hair. I thought this product would help hair loss and keep hair looking and feeling healthy like it claims. All it did was make my hair brittle and break even more. It tingles on your head so I can see how it cleans out the pores, which is good for the scalp, but like I said it leaves my hair dry and frizzy.</li>
    <li> I started using this product about two weeks now and I notice less hair coming off during shower. I will recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The product seems to work and this kit is well priced for what it contains. Good buy, would recommend it.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used it for a mothe now &amp; i&#x27;m still loosing hair specially when i shower... but not much like before! &amp; I don&#x27;t notice any new hair growing :( i&#x27;m still gonna try though...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m seeing hair growth after just a few weeks!  Better than I expected.  Tried Rogaine with no results.  Bosley rocks!</li>
    <li> Humn? A product that&#x27;s supposed to help fill in hair that doesn&#x27;t. Humn, I&#x27;ll go back to my traditional EWG-approved soaps. Too bad</li>
    <li> You really need to use it for a while but it does improve hair loss.</li>
    <li> Dont bother. look for something else</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll let u kno if it works</li>
    <li> the product didn&#x27;t do much for my hair. perhaps i didn&#x27;t use it for at least 90 days. it did leave some residue on my scalp.</li>
    <li> The product came in before the arrival date which was great! When I started using the product my hair did feel thicker and like there was more there. After about a week my hair started to feel normal again as if the stuff stopped working. These were relatively small bottles and probably wouldnt have lasted me more than 3 weeks with daily use as I am a woman with medium-long hair. I wasnt sure if this product was for women or men though I wish they would have specified that more. After I stopped using it my hair is right back to what it always was. If you want to continually buy this product maybe it would be better for you but I didnt see much real difference after I used it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to do much after 2 months. Had better luck rinsing with apple cider vinegar twice a week, it&#x27;s cheaper and actually dissolves DHT.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing for me! I used this along with Biotin and didn&#x27;t see any results.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I&#x27;m thinning on top and getting bare in my crown area. Not to say that it doesn&#x27;t work, it just did nothing for me. After one or two times using it the cool feeling that you get is unnoticable. It&#x27;s not a complete waste of money, but you might be better off going with something else.</li>
    <li> I would not buy it again. It&#x27;s such an unpleasant I don&#x27;t even use it. At that cost they could at least make it smell good.</li>
    <li> I thought there was nothing out there to help my receding hairline. I used rogaine with little luck, even though it specifically says, only for bald spots on top your head. Anyway I had small hairs around my receding hairline that never grew and were very thin. I used the shampoo and conditioner daily, never touched the other thing. After a week or two those hairs and the outline of my hairline started growing and thickening. I haven&#x27;t had a haircut in 5months so the new growths are very obvious. When cleaning your hair, massage your scalp to get the nutrients flowing. I also used a scrub to unclog any pores that may have follicles trying to grow. I have noticed my hair falling out some, probably because I never rubbed conditioner in my hair before and letting it sit then looking down at my hands. It&#x27;s not bad and that is the only time I see it coming out which is pretty normal. This isn&#x27;t an overnight thing, it takes time and consistency. the shampoo lasts a really long time too. 23y/o male, been on this for a month, will continue to use.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair feel like straw and the product that you treat your scalp with leaves my hair feeling greasy.  I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> 24 Years of Age-Hair is thinning on top and back center&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product first intrigued me with its myriad of mixed reviews. Some complained that it did not work, others claimed that it completely rejuvenated their head of hair, while still others vocalized how cheated they felt as their hair undeniably became even thinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical, myself, but for the price and small chance of success, I figured I had nothing to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 7 months of religious use, I regrettably inform you that I saw absolutely no change in the fullness or thickness of my hair. Heredity must have hit me like a brick wall, then built that brick wall around my head. I cannot say with certainty that this product will work for each and every individual, but what is $30 or $40 for a chance? Clearly this product has worked on others, so who is to say that it won&#x27;t work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My review is positive, because I am positive. You should be, as well.</li>
    <li> Great product and price!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for the woman of my life and she used it for a while and then she said it made her hair look wrong.</li>
    <li> It nourished my hair very well, I only don&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I&#x27;m using it for around 20 days and I didn&#x27;t see yet much differences in hair growth (maybe if I use more days it will work).</li>
    <li> I purchased it because of the reviews for my dad who is thinning on the top.  He used it religiously for a few months every day and none of us saw anything difference.  Should have know that there is no miracle product.  It didn&#x27;t thicken the look of the hair.  It was just shampoo and conditioner.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s and have been losing hair for a couple years.  Been using this product for a week.  It makes my scalp feel great and the hair has stopped falling out.  I am so much happier with the results of this product than Nioxin System 2.</li>
    <li> Good but not as good as Nioxin in my opinion only</li>
    <li> I have been using that product for 4 months and I have new hair growth and less fall out. I&#x27;ve suggested this product to every one I know. I even take it to the beauty salon and she uses it when she dose my hair. Price is crazy great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 6 months and I&#x27;m and definitely seeing a difference in my hair.  The bald spots have not filled in yet, but I see a bit of new growth in the 4&amp;#34; section at my crown and that is totally bald.  I cannot afford to have the hair transplant, so I&#x27;ll use this product until I cannot afford it anymore and it looks as if I&#x27;ll get better looking hair.</li>
