      <li>Smells nice</li>
      <li>price was great, product was exactly as described.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never used it as a bath oil, and frankly, I think bath oils are just ways to make the tub need cleaning more often.</li>
      <li>It is not my favorite scent</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for more years than I can remember as a temporary, non-irritating, okay-smelling  but sort of greasy mosquito repellant.</li>
      <li>Love this product .....</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not 100% sure that it does</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even know if there are Avon Ladies any more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not terribly fond of the scent</li>
      <li>It is my favorite bath oil I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>We have quite the mosquito problem this year so this is wonderful for spraying on everyone before they go outside and repelling the mosquitoes.  </li>
      <li>Perfect for dry skin, baths.</li>
      <li>Smells so good, feels so clean and fresh.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you get the original if you want it for mosquitos.</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t seem as strong.</li>
      <li>It was nice to find this large bottle so easily.</li>
      <li>Never have an itchy back and smells great.</li>
      <li>I like the light fragrance I have when you get close, too.</li>
      <li>Great to keep away those pesky mosquitos and yellow flies in FL</li>
      <li>If the Marines love it while fighting in the bug filled desert, that&#x27;s high recommendation indeed.</li>
      <li>They used to give away these tiny lipstick samples that I loved.</li>
      <li>It helps to leave the interior foil lining intact and prick the foil top with a pin so you can control how much oil you use.  </li>
      <li>For me it is a great alternative to deet or other chemical mosquito</li>
      <li>I love the skin so soft line.  </li>
      <li>I love this bath oil, lightly fragranced and really helps my dry skin!</li>
      <li>I prefer the smell of the pink label kind, but this one does the job.</li>
      <li>We just put it in a spray bottle with some water and it really does the job!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always worried that Avon would mess up this exceptional product by changing the formula</li>
      <li>I payed $5:00 for shipping that was too much to pay for 12.00 purchase.</li>
      <li>thanks.</li>
      <li>Also, it really does make the Skin So Soft!</li>
      <li>So Soft for years to repel bug bites.</li>
      <li>The product does what it says, leaves my skin soft and silky.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using for over 30 years and people tell me how soft my skin is.  </li>
      <li>but I have been using it in a spray bottle mixed with my lotion and haven&#x27;t gotten any new (knock on wood!)</li>
      <li>This is as useful removing the hard water mineral deposits as it is keeping mosquitoes at bey and softening skin.  </li>

<li> It works, a little goes a long way and it doesn&#x27;t lose much effectiveness in the bottle if stored properly.</li>
<li> This is a redesigned bottle, clear instead of translucent, which is why I suggest it be kept in a dark cabinet and not out on the counter.</li>
<li> The bottle was a sample from a long, long ago Avon Lady.</li>
<li> (But dogs generally hate to smell good.)</li>
<li> Point off for inconvenience of having to reapply and greasiness, Although the oil may well be beneficial for dry skin.</li>
<li> Just be careful, it will stain some fabrics but washed out of my cotton walking clothes</li>
<li> Heart worm in dogs is carried by mosquitos as are other diseases.</li>
<li> Wish it smelled better because it actually smells like bug repellent to me.</li>
<li> I put this in a small bottle and drip it down my back every time I shower.  </li>
<li> I can&#x27;t stand products with DEET and other vile smelling, irritating, probably poisonous (only speculating) formulae for insects.</li>
<li> Takes off hard water stains and nasty built up oven grease in a snap.</li>
<li> I put this into a spray bottle and use it as an insect repellent.  </li>

    <li> I put this into a spray bottle and use it as an insect repellent.  Just be careful, it will stain some fabrics but washed out of my cotton walking clothes just fine.&lt;br /&gt;If you bathe with this beware that it will turn your shower/tub into a slip and slide. I wash my tub after using this every time.</li>
    <li> I got this to do cleaning. Takes off hard water stains and nasty built up oven grease in a snap.</li>
    <li> Perfect for dry skin, baths. Smells nice</li>
    <li> Avon, light oil moisturizing and great fragrance. My mother loves this product and wanted it for Christmas. It was nice to find this large bottle so easily.</li>
    <li> Great value for the size!!! I prefer the smell of the pink label kind, but this one does the job.</li>
    <li> I love this bath oil, lightly fragranced and really helps my dry skin! Only wish the cap had a built in dispenser!</li>
    <li> Have used this over the years after showering to prevent bug bites and it works.  The only thing I do not like is how greasy it is.</li>
    <li> We have quite the mosquito problem this year so this is wonderful for spraying on everyone before they go outside and repelling the mosquitoes.  We just put it in a spray bottle with some water and it really does the job!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for more years than I can remember as a temporary, non-irritating, okay-smelling  but sort of greasy mosquito repellant. It works, a little goes a long way and it doesn&#x27;t lose much effectiveness in the bottle if stored properly. It does only last about 30 minutes to repel mosquitos, enough for a walk in the evening along a lake or beach (works against sand fleas too). I have a miniature bottle that I refill and carry in my pocket. The bottle was a sample from a long, long ago Avon Lady. I don&#x27;t even know if there are Avon Ladies any more. They used to give away these tiny lipstick samples that I loved. Back to the present. This is a redesigned bottle, clear instead of translucent, which is why I suggest it be kept in a dark cabinet and not out on the counter. I&#x27;ve never used it as a bath oil, and frankly, I think bath oils are just ways to make the tub need cleaning more often. I&#x27;ve always worried that Avon would mess up this exceptional product by changing the formula and I think they have from time to time. Make sure you get the original if you want it for mosquitos. I can&#x27;t stand products with DEET and other vile smelling, irritating, probably poisonous (only speculating) formulae for insects. I stick with this one. If you wonder why Avon doesn&#x27;t advertise this feature, it&#x27;s probably because it would have to go through a bunch of testing and get FDA approval. Just market it as a bath oil and let word of mouth keep the brand going. Point off for inconvenience of having to reapply and greasiness, Although the oil may well be beneficial for dry skin. Another thing is my dog hates when I put it on her to go to the park. (But dogs generally hate to smell good.) Heart worm in dogs is carried by mosquitos as are other diseases. I give mine a HW preventive, but just like to keep her from being bitten.</li>
    <li> The product does what it says, leaves my skin soft and silky.  I love the skin so soft line.  Will definitely be ordering again!</li>
    <li> Love this product .....this is great for summertime keeps Mosquitos away. I payed $5:00 for shipping that was too much to pay for 12.00 purchase.</li>
    <li> Love it! Smells awesome!</li>
    <li> I bought this as I heard from others that it&#x27;s good for repelling bugs. I&#x27;m not 100% sure that it does but I have been using it in a spray bottle mixed with my lotion and haven&#x27;t gotten any new (knock on wood!) mosquito bites. I&#x27;m not terribly fond of the scent but I dilute it with my lotion and it doesn&#x27;t seem as strong.</li>
    <li> What can I say, I have used Skin So Soft for years to repel bug bites. It works!  It is not my favorite scent but that&#x27;s not why I use it.  For me it is a great alternative to deet or other chemical mosquito repellants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: this size does not come with a dispenser - once it is opened, it will spill inside a travel bag (that&#x27;s why four stars not five).  It helps to leave the interior foil lining intact and prick the foil top with a pin so you can control how much oil you use.  But even with this option the oil will stil spill in a travel bag.</li>
    <li> I put this in a small bottle and drip it down my back every time I shower.  Never have an itchy back and smells great.</li>
    <li> I rub all over the body after a shower and towel blot the skin.  I&#x27;ve been using for over 30 years and people tell me how soft my skin is.  I like the light fragrance I have when you get close, too.</li>
    <li> This item was purchased for my granddaughter to use on her horses to keep horse flies off them.</li>
    <li> This is as useful removing the hard water mineral deposits as it is keeping mosquitoes at bey and softening skin.  If the Marines love it while fighting in the bug filled desert, that&#x27;s high recommendation indeed.</li>
    <li> Wish it smelled better because it actually smells like bug repellent to me.</li>
    <li> I mix this with water and spray on my dogs  and myself before we go hiking.</li>
    <li> Smells so good, feels so clean and fresh.  It is my favorite bath oil I have ever used.  Also, it really does make the Skin So Soft!</li>
    <li> I had been told this would prevent mosquito bites. Not so, they still bit me&lt;br /&gt;every which way even with the oil on. Some people may have&lt;br /&gt;benefited from the oil but not me.</li>
    <li> Great to keep away those pesky mosquitos and yellow flies in FL</li>
    <li> Got for making a fly spray for horses. Have not tried it!!!</li>
    <li> price was great, product was exactly as described. it came intact. thanks. paula</li>
