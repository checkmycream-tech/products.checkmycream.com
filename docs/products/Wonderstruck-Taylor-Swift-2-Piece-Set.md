      <li>The packaging of this item is fabulous!!!</li>

      <li>Also, the gift box that it comes in is actually very nice, a purple velvety material</li>
      <li>The scent is gorgeous and not overpowering.  </li>
      <li>I love perfume, this is a great addition to my collection.  </li>
      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>Love this set!  </li>
      <li>First off this perfume is awesome, I love the smell!</li>
      <li>Nice gift set.</li>
      <li>Nice set.</li>
      <li>Either it was an ok deal or an amazing deal</li>
      <li>But wow, the box came in great packaging and for the price I paid, I&#x27;m blown away!</li>
      <li>Purse spray was a bonus and her friends love spraying it.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this.</li>
      <li>I thought for sure it was supposed to say 1oz bottle.</li>
      <li>Love the way this smells.</li>
      <li>While replacement item was slightly more in cost, if I wanted that I would have ordered it.</li>
      <li>I really enjoyed the way it was packaged.  </li>
      <li>The roller perfume and jewelry box are an added bonus. :)</li>
      <li>Very unique, I have never smelled another perfume like it.</li>
      <li>The jewelry box is kind of cheap looking, made of purple velvety material, but I took the bow off and it looks fine on my dresser.</li>
      <li>Surprisingly delicious fragrance, light enough to use every day.  </li>
      <li>The roller is easy to carry in any purse to refresh the fragrance mid-day.</li>
      <li>It is not too strong, and has no musky smell at all.  </li>
      <li>It is very light and sweet smelling, like floral vanilla, but not too sweet.  </li>
      <li>Comes with a beautiful purple velvet box to make it extra special.</li>
      <li>Very nice for a teenage girl.</li>
      <li>This was such a good deal, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up.</li>
      <li>Somehow this frag seems kind of &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; to me although it has no green notes, it might be the tea.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s true to size and comes in a jewelry box to keep in a pretty purple color!</li>
      <li>So when I saw this one on Amazon as a 3.4oz bottle AND a roll on perfume bottle for only $21 I honestly thought that it was a mistake.</li>
      <li>Shipped quick and packaging was good as usual.</li>
      <li>The packaging looks higher in quality in person.</li>
      <li>so I took the chance and ordered it and to my surprise it really is a 3.4oz bottle!</li>
      <li>The little spritzer for her purse is a nice touch.  </li>
      <li>Very girly scent and presentation.</li>
      <li>I really like the roll on bottle that comes in this set because I can keep it in my purse.</li>
      <li>I decided to check out how much it would be on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>and you can take the blue plastic out and just use it as a box to keep stuff in, pretty cool.</li>
      <li>Very pretty, just as pictured, would definitely buy again!</li>
      <li>Buying another one right now, actually!</li>
      <li>I get good wear out of this, I can usually still smell it the next day although it fades into something very similar to D&amp;G Light Blue.</li>
      <li>I mainly use this doing the summmer, and her red scent during the winter and spring.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very nice everyday fragrance, not too juvinile but still a bit whimsical.</li>

<li> Did not get Wonderstruck Jewelry Box gift set as ordered, item was switched without approval and did not have time to exchange due to Christmas rush.</li>
<li> If you&#x27;re here looking for review of the fragrance, Wonderstruck is primarily a black tea/blackberry scent on me with a woody dry down.</li>
<li> I bought this for my niece for her birthday, it is subtle, soft and delicate.  </li>
<li> I was not happy at all.</li>

    <li> wonderful smell and very cute bottle and roll on!  I really enjoyed the way it was packaged.  Perfect for a gift or just for yourself!</li>
    <li> First off this perfume is awesome, I love the smell! Very unique, I have never smelled another perfume like it. I bought a 1oz bottle last year at a store for about $20 and that seemed like the average price. That bottle lasted me until now. So when I saw this one on Amazon as a 3.4oz bottle AND a roll on perfume bottle for only $21 I honestly thought that it was a mistake. I thought for sure it was supposed to say 1oz bottle. Either it was an ok deal or an amazing deal so I took the chance and ordered it and to my surprise it really is a 3.4oz bottle! Cannot believe what a terrific deal it is. I am thinking about stocking up and buying more while it lasts!! Shipped quick and packaging was good as usual. Also, the gift box that it comes in is actually very nice, a purple velvety material and you can take the blue plastic out and just use it as a box to keep stuff in, pretty cool.</li>
    <li> I was hesistant to buy this because of the price. In stores it is a lot more expensive. But wow, the box came in great packaging and for the price I paid, I&#x27;m blown away! Buying another one right now, actually!</li>
    <li> Love it!  The scent is gorgeous and not overpowering.  The gift set is a great deal, too.  I went to the post exchange on Ft Lewis and the 3.4 oz bottle was almost 50 dollars.  I decided to check out how much it would be on Amazon.  SO happy I checked here before purchasing it retail.  The roller perfume and jewelry box are an added bonus. :)</li>
    <li> Delivered in time for Xmas and she wears the perfume all the time. Purse spray was a bonus and her friends love spraying it.</li>
    <li> This was such a good deal, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up. The jewelry box is kind of cheap looking, made of purple velvety material, but I took the bow off and it looks fine on my dresser. If you&#x27;re here looking for review of the fragrance, Wonderstruck is primarily a black tea/blackberry scent on me with a woody dry down.

I get good wear out of this, I can usually still smell it the next day although it fades into something very similar to D&amp;G Light Blue. Sillage isn&#x27;t the best, it sits close to your skin. Somehow this frag seems kind of &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; to me although it has no green notes, it might be the tea. This one is not a sugarbomb like Wonderstruck Enchanted.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my niece for her birthday, it is subtle, soft and delicate.  Very nice for a teenage girl.</li>
    <li> The packaging of this item is fabulous!!! Would make for a wonderful gift! I was blown away! It&#x27;s true to size and comes in a jewelry box to keep in a pretty purple color!</li>
    <li> my daughter loves the set!  The little spritzer for her purse is a nice touch.  Very girly scent and presentation.</li>
    <li> When I got it the bottle was smashed and the perfume was everywhere I was not happy at all. I would get it from somewhere else.</li>
    <li> Nice set. Came in a beautiful velvet box. Love the way this smells.</li>
    <li> I wear Wonderstruck on a daily basis.  It is very light and sweet smelling, like floral vanilla, but not too sweet.  I get complimented on it often.  It is not too strong, and has no musky smell at all.  I really like the roll on bottle that comes in this set because I can keep it in my purse.</li>
    <li> I love perfume, this is a great addition to my collection.  The purse size roller is perfect.  Comes with a beautiful purple velvet box to make it extra special.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this. I mainly use this doing the summmer, and her red scent during the winter and spring.</li>
    <li> THE SMELL IS GREAT BUT IT DOESN&#x27;T LAST ALL THROUGHOUT THE DAY.  I WOULD STILL RECOMMEND BUYING IT.  .. ..</li>
    <li> Nice gift set. The packaging looks higher in quality in person.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly delicious fragrance, light enough to use every day.  The roller is easy to carry in any purse to refresh the fragrance mid-day.</li>
    <li> Love this set!  Was a great gift for my daughter!  Very pretty, just as pictured, would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Did not get Wonderstruck Jewelry Box gift set as ordered, item was switched without approval and did not have time to exchange due to Christmas rush. While replacement item was slightly more in cost, if I wanted that I would have ordered it.</li>
    <li> It was a gift and she loves it</li>
