<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Have used this perfume for years!!! Love it! Great price and great delivery!!!</li>
    <li> One of my wife&#x27;s all-time favorites! Great price and hard to find size!!</li>
    <li> Ralph Lauren Safari is my favorite cologne and I can&#x27;t seem to find anything to replace it!!!  I&#x27;ve tried expensive new colognes and end up giving them away.  Lauren Co. doesn&#x27;t  have Safari in production any more and I&#x27;ve been able to find it online, but it is getting harder to find!!!  The company that shipped the product did a great job, the cologne was well packed and arrived in a timely fashion.</li>
    <li> Not much to say--it was what it purported to be; it came quickly and the price was good. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, so there were not any surprizes as far as the actual item.</li>
    <li> I bought mine through Ralph Lauren Web site. So I know I got the real deal. I used to wear this in the 90&#x27;s and while it smells close to the original something seems off. The current scent gives me massive headaches and burns my nose and throat. Makes me sad as this was my all time favorite perfume, and when I put it on I could not get it off fast enough. Disappointing.  Maybe it&#x27;s just that I&#x27;m older now, although other perfumes smell the same on me. Take my review as you will. To me it&#x27;s off a bit.</li>
    <li> my wife has been wearing this scent for years, best and cheapest place to get it</li>
    <li> As always I have the priviledge to give a positive review on the products ordered through Amazon.  The speed in which I received my merchandise was great!  The product arrived in good condition and was what I ordered.  I love this perfume!!!!!</li>
    <li> No complaints. I got it fast and in time for Christmas. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Gift for a friend. She was delighted to receive it and loves it. Hard to find for her. Great price. Quick delivery and a big hit.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery and happy with items</li>
    <li> Very satisfied. Product arrived as expected. Product smells amazing.</li>
    <li> After ordering and waiting on this item to give as a christmas gift, the company cancelled my order without any explanation at all! I will never order from them again. You shouldnt either.</li>
    <li> Good price. It&#x27;s been getting harder to find this fragrance, but it&#x27;s long been my absolute favorite! I&#x27;ve tried so many newer fragrances, but always get compliments on this one.</li>
    <li> A nice clean smell...women should give it a try. A give it a five star.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Safari perfume for over 20 years. All my friends like the way I smell. I&#x27;m smelling beautiful!</li>
    <li> I have used this for many years and wish Ralph Lauren would produce it again!</li>
    <li> I was wearing Safari in my late teens when I met my husband. I wore it on my wedding day. And now, 18+ years later, I am close to finishing the original bottle that has remained such a faithful friend all these years. Her intoxicating yet complex scent brings back all the happiness, joy, and romance of being young and knowing what you want in life. Safari went with me to each job interview, celebrated all the highs of life and helped comfort me during all the lows. If I could give a gift of myself to a fragrance, it would be to you, Safari!</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance and pleased that I can still find it with Amazon.com.[[ASIN:B001M5UEBW Safari by Ralph Lauren for Women, Eau De Parfum Natural Spray, 2.5 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> This was a gift for our daughter-in-law who wears Safari.</li>
    <li> The one and only scent that works well with my body chemistry. Not cloying, heavy, flowery, musky, powdery or stinky.</li>
    <li> I loved this cologne when Dillard&#x27;s sold it.  It was light and airy.&lt;br /&gt;This is quite strong!</li>
    <li> Even though this cologne has been discontinued in the US for several years I can always count on Amazon to have it!</li>
    <li> My wife has been using SAFARI for years, both of love it..&lt;br /&gt;She gets many compliments on the product..&lt;br /&gt;Lauren should NOT discontinue the product..&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000R9UU9U Safari by Ralph Lauren for Women 2.5 oz Eau de Parfum Spray]]</li>
    <li> Safari is impossible to find in any retail store.  Buying it through Amazon is simple and easy. This is the 3rd time I have ordered through Amazon and am completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> So happy to find this product.  Can&#x27;t imagine WHY RL discontinued it! I&#x27;d used this fragrance for years, and have&#x27;t found any that come close.</li>
    <li> Price was great and product was perfect.  I have been looking for a value like this for a long time.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Yep, just as great as it was years ago. Couldn&#x27;t fins the powder. Is it available?</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my mother-in-law because she hadn&#x27;t been able to find it in years. She was so excited to be reunited with this classic scent.</li>
    <li> My signature fragrance does not smell the same nor last as long on the skin</li>
    <li> The item was advertised as \\&quot;new\\&quot; Ralph Lauren&#x27;s Safari for Women and it simply wasn&#x27;t.  It was a high-priced knock-off so I sent it back. It would be one thing if I just didn&#x27;t pick up on language suggesting it was \\&quot;like\\&quot; the perfume but to outright sell it AS the product is really reprehensible. I have my money back but am totally disappointed.</li>
    <li> i simply LOVE this Parfum - have been using it for many years - Amazon is the only place I can purchase it as they have taken it off the shelves in all department stores.</li>
    <li> I started waring Safari Fragrance 15 years ago and loved it.  Anytime my children smelled it, they smiled and said, \\&quot;MMM, that smells like my mother\\&quot;.  So basically it became my signature fragrance.  I was so upset when I found it had been discontinued and so happy that I had finally found it back.  I think I have stocked up so it will last me the rest of my life! :-)</li>
    <li> The safari was perfect. I was unable to find it in stores for many years. Glad to have,a place to go to find it at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> The best fragrance I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> The perfume arrived quickly and in great condition.  It was a birthday gift for my daughter and she was excited to receive it!</li>
    <li> Parfum did not have as good of a fragrance as previously purchased product!  Would not recommend purchasing from this source</li>
    <li> Best fragrance ever . I get complements on it all the time . It is not to strong has a very pleasant fragrance . I hate they quit selling it in department stores .</li>
    <li> A couple of years ago RL stopped selling this gorgeous perfume.  The price fell to about $25-30 a bottle and I started stashing it.  At one time I had six bottles in my linen closet.  Well, they brought it back and is now about $85 a bottle.  It&#x27;s ok though, it is worth it!  I&#x27;ve been wearing it since it came out in 1990 and receive lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> Have much time wanting to buy this perfume, I remember great moments. The scent lasts me not all day. that hurts.</li>
    <li> She was very happy for the holiday .  It was very well handled and everything was early.  Thanks for your help  John</li>
    <li> I love this unique scent. It is very hard to find in any dept store&lt;br /&gt;It has a hint of cinnamon which is delicious.&lt;br /&gt;My signature scent</li>
    <li> this is one of my top 2 favorite perfumes.  the other one is ralph lauren, as well....in burgundy square bottle...a classic.  i always get compliments on safari. i wear safari in the summer months and lauren in the winter.  the package arrived promptly and in good condition.  i am very pleased w/my purchase.</li>
    <li> Love love this, it is my signature fragrance. Purchases from the past have lasted me at least a year. It seems as though this fragrance&#x27;s formula has changed - doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long. Never had to reapply, but have to now. Color doesn&#x27;t appear to be as deep an amber as my original purchases. Because it is my favorite I will still purchase, but I&#x27;m sadly disappointed.</li>
    <li> My wife likes this perfume very much</li>
    <li> Great product. Arrived promptly. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in the product-the scent is very old. Smell doesn&#x27;t last</li>
    <li> I love safari cologne for women.  This is the only thing I ever wear.  You have to order it on line, because it is not sold in any stores except your main Perfume stores.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves it</li>
    <li> I have worn this since is has been on the market.  I cannot find anything that comes close.  It&#x27;s my absolute favorite!!</li>
    <li> One of my wife&#x27;s favorite. A no-brainer, really. Lovely scent and this small amount will last a long time, since a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> My favorite, &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; perfume since it was first introduced to the market...probably over 20 years ago.  A gentle, fresh fragrance.  Wish it was still offered without the spray nozzle, so I could dab on as little or as much as I chose.</li>
    <li> So very glad that I am able to still obtain, this scent, it&#x27;s been my favorite for years, and I get many compliments on how it smells on me, so I will continue to seek it out from providers for as long as they may have it available.</li>
    <li> This Safari does not smell like the Safari I used to buy. It must loose it&#x27;s fragrance after it gets old.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.  Had heard it was no longer on the market, so was delighted to find it on Amazon.  Great place to shop!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the only perfume I will wear in the summer.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it every since it debuted back in the nineties.  I&#x27;m very pleased I can still get this fragrnce from Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> Delighted to receive my order of Safari Women Eau De Parfum Spray.  I love it and so does my husband.  Each time I wear it someone comments on how nice a fragrance it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have worn Safari by Ralph Lauren for 20 plus years.  It works on me!  I can&#x27;t wear just any fragrance. Knowing it has been discontinued made me sad but happily found a source thru Amazon.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume and you are the only place I can still find it. My husband loves it too. Every body wants to know what I wear!</li>
    <li> This is very hard to find and my wife always has it on her Christmas list.</li>
    <li> I ENJOY this fragrance.</li>
    <li> Great service and a wonderful, refreshing scent!</li>
    <li> the shipper enclosed with the bottle  a coupon for $ off the next purchase &#x3D;&#x3D; but that coupon  expired Sept 13.</li>
    <li> I loved Safari from the first moment I smelled it&#x27;s intoxicating fragrance.- in 1990.  I made it my signature perfume.  When they stopped production I was heartbroken.  I spent years buying it on line at inflated prices.  Now, they make it again.  But the sad truth is, it isn&#x27;t the original formula.  So even though the name is the same and the smell is similar.. the perfection of it, is gone.  Do I still like this remake??? OH YES!  It&#x27;s ralph Laurens renewed version of an old favorite.  It&#x27;s still the only one I like wearing... and the one my husband still comments on.  I have gotten it from perfumania  when I have been near one of their stores.  The price is good and I still think it&#x27;s worth the investment.  It&#x27;s 25 dollars more buying it from  the Ralph Lauren store.  I&#x27;ll be buying it on line from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I would order from Amazon again very satisfied with my product !</li>
    <li> Absolutely my favorite perfume. For years, my husband knew exactly which perfume to buy me. I had all of the little bits and bobs when suddenly it went out of production. After years, it is finally available again in this size brought back by popular demand, I am sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a lovely floral - not too sweet. It worked for me in my twenties and still does in my fifties. It is the type of fragrance that becomes a signature scent. I have a lot of allergies to perfumes but this one is a great exception. Absolutely the best.</li>
    <li> Perfume was just what I expected and was delivered promptly.</li>
    <li> So glad someone still carries this scent.  I always get compliments when I wear it.</li>
    <li> I got it for my wife but I had come across a sample years ago.  I loved it then and I love it now.  Expensive yes.  I don&#x27;t think that they make it anymore so I guess it will get more pricey as time goes but.  I don&#x27;t know that for sure but it is getting harder to get my hands on any.</li>
    <li> One of the most beautiful fragrances out there.  I was one of the Safari women promoting the fragrance back when it first came out giving away samples. I have been a fan ever since and still love the smell. Ralph Lauren this is a winner and Amazon you&#x27;re amazing on all the products you can find!!!</li>
    <li> Birthday gift for my wife who loves this product. Great price and easy to order. Received product very quickly and in good shape.</li>
    <li> Love the old school fragrance</li>
    <li> This Ralph  Lauren fragrance disappeared from the department stores shelves 9 years ago.  I&#x27;ve been searching for a similar product, found a few close calls but none as lovely as Safari.  A friend told me to check Amazon.com and sure enough it was still available.  The price was excellent and the package arrived ahead of schedule.</li>
    <li> Beautiful fragrance, along with a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite fragrance and I bought it for her birthday which is right after Christmas.  I always have a hard time finding it and just thought I would try Amazon.  Sure enough, they had it and at  a cheaper price than all the fragrance outlets; I was thrilled.  I can&#x27;t wait to give it to her.  Thank you Amazon!  I would like to add that this is a lovely fragrance with all the elegance that the name Ralph Lauren implies.  It&#x27;s long lasting and comes in a wonderfully cut crystal bottle that is reminescent of days gone by suggesting the \\&quot;roaring\\&quot; twenties.</li>
    <li> My favorite fragrance by far, nothing else measures up! I always get compliments on how nice I smell from men and women alike.</li>
    <li> I received a bottle of immitation Safar Perfume. It was a knock-off. Needless to say I am disappointed. Do not purchase this product!</li>
    <li> From past experience, Safari is a great scent.  I must admit that I have yet to open the bottle.  I do  not think I will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I feel as good as with Chanel #5.</li>
    <li> wish they still made it..worn it for years..love it</li>
    <li> So glad I found it here!  Been discontinued for a while. Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I have used Ralph Lauren Safari parfum spray for years. It is basically the only parfum I use and get compliments a lot. It is gentle yet strong enough to be pleasant to others. I don&#x27;t understand why they stopped selling it in stores. Hopefully I will always be able to buy it online. I have tested other perfumes in stores but they never come close to Safari, for me.</li>
    <li> Terrible product and shame on Ralph Lauren for putting his name on this junk. Save your money . Do Not Buy This !</li>
    <li> I frequently get compliments on this fragrance. Would love to see 100% parfum available but the Eau de parfum does have some staying power.</li>
    <li> I just love this perfume, but it was discontinued in the department stores about 6 years ago, around 2008.  They still carry Safari for Men, but not for women. Go figure.  So when I found it on-line, I ordered it and it still has the same great fragrance as always.  I get many compliments when I wear this perfume.  I would highly recommend ordering this product.</li>
    <li> Received the order on time, but the quality of this perfume is very poor. I paid too much for low quality.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift for a young lady.. Good value and smells great on her.... She had trouble locating it where she lives, so it came as a nice surprise to her.. glad I  got it for her</li>
    <li> Sophisticated, exotic,  and yet classic,  this scent is one of a kind!  This was my signature scent for years and  I got compliments from the 6 year olds in my first grade class and from adult male and female friends.  However, to my knowledge, Ralph Lauren discontinued this product several years ago.  The  scent that I received was my same wonderful  one, however, the scent&lt;br /&gt; immediately floats away and is gone . Isn&#x27;t parfume  supposed to linger?  So.... to the powers that be at Ralph Lauren:  please, please, please start creating Safari again !</li>
    <li> Had been having a hard time locating this perfume, bought it for my grandmother.. She loves it!</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for my 70 year old grandmother. She said that it was just as she remembered it from when she would buy it at Bergners. She had no complaints. The package arrived quickly and the bottle is LOVELY.</li>
    <li> HAVE ALWAYS LOVED THIS FRAGRANCE.  I&#x27;M REALLY HAPPY TO HAVE FOUND IT AGAIN</li>
    <li> I love the smell of Safari.  However, 2006 was the last production of this Parfum line and probably sitting on the shelves too long has changed the smell.  I didn&#x27;t recognized the scent. Wish they would bring it back for a limited time.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and was so happy when I finally found it on Amazon.  I had been looking for it for years.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife, who has been wearing this fragrance since the early nineties. The fragrance is not the same as the numerous bottles we have purchased in the past. The bottle does not have the trademark &amp;#34;R&amp;#34; on it and the fragrance is definitely different. I think this may be a counterfeit. I will ask for a return.</li>
    <li> Product is as expected. Do not like that you have to write at least 18 words or more for a review. Dumb requirement.</li>
    <li> This is my favirute fragrances and ut arruved quickly and I am 100% pleased with the product and service.</li>
    <li> This is not the original Safari for Women, just FYI. Otherwise, received as described.</li>
    <li> I like the scent. My wife likes the scent. Not too many places to buy it where you don&#x27;t get scalped</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve work Safari for many years and am convinced that this is counterfeit. Don&#x27;t purchase it.</li>
    <li> I wore this  Eau De Parfum Spray in the 1990s and loved it.  However, I have been unable to find it in the stores anymore.  I was extremely happy to locate it again.</li>
    <li> The smell seems off and gives me a headache, unfortunately by the time the gift was opened it was too late to return it.</li>
    <li> Have used this Perfume for years, but now hard to get.  Wish they still made the lotion, it was nicer than all others.</li>
