    <li> Proactiv deep cleansing body wash gets your body squeaky clean as it gently exfoliates, revealing the natural glow of your skin.  With the invigorating smell of eucalyptus, it is simply like no other.  It can be used by both Men and Women, so the clutter in your shower stall can be reduced.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for years now and I have no desire to try anything else.  I am just that satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it for yourself, you will be satisfied as well.  Count on it!  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Mindhaunt</li>

    <li> Proactiv deep cleansing wash is the only thing that works on my back acne.. I tried everything, and when I say everything, I mean even accutane, which didn&#x27;t work, because I do not have oily skin, not cystic acne, but very stubborn hormonal acne. To people who say it doesn&#x27;t work, I say be patient and give it time. My acne does flare up during time of hormonal imbalance, and I would say that other than that, my acne is 95-100% cleared. I have been using proactiv deep cleansing for over a year and a half now and I use proactiv plus for my face, because their original formula didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> works the best for my children</li>
    <li> it broke out both my daughter and me. I&#x27;ll stick to the proactiv bar.</li>
    <li> I have ache on my back I thought this product would clear it up, my mistake it did not. I would save your money.</li>
