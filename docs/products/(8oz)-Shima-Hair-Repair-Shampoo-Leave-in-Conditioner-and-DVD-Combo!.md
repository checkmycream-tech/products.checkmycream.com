      <li>Also, who ever said her products smell good is a bold face lie.</li>
      <li>This is more then my expectations.</li>
      <li>but i am glad that you are one of my hair inspirations....</li>
      <li>but if you can get over that these are outstanding.</li>
      <li>I had to use another product on top of the leave in.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s more of a staple product for me.</li>
      <li>I love all of Shima hair products.</li>

      <li>Well.. i love shima oil the most..</li>
      <li>The ingredients are phenomenal and it leaves my hair looking thicker and stronger</li>
      <li>for weeks before I ever purchased, but I am so glad that I did.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many others.</li>
      <li>I have to admit that I love the healthy direction my hair is going.</li>
      <li>I hope that by winning  I will have a chance to try it.</li>
      <li>then i.. love her more than i..</li>
      <li>i love your products..</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend purchasing these products, you will be very pleased with the results!</li>
      <li>but I really wasn&#x27;t expecting anything good out of this either, but my hair is thicker</li>
      <li>and plus it makes my hair easy to comb when washing out...</li>
      <li>I parted it in sections and combed it easily, just as instructed.  </li>
      <li>&quot; There were many good reviews and the products were natural.</li>
      <li>Not only does it have great moisturizing properties</li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable buying a repair shampoo (b/c</li>
      <li>They really are amazing.</li>
      <li>So I proceeded to wash the shampoo out of my hair and it still felt slippery and smooth, so</li>
      <li>I just reviewed a Shima oil, and so far is good.  </li>
      <li>It gives my hair just the right amount of moisture  and shine an I also love the conditioner.</li>
      <li>Thanks Shima!!!      </li>
      <li>I absolutely love how healthy, soft and strong my hair has become since using the shampoo and leave in conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I received the Shima Hair Repair shampoo during an online win from a youtube natural hair contest when this was first launched.  </li>
      <li>The shampoo smells really good, and never left residue, but made my hair feel really strong like aphogee.  </li>
      <li>It was free flowing and full of body.</li>
      <li>Shima really cares about your hair and products are very quality and sulfate free and good for hair care.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ll use a goats milk shampoo bar from Sassy goats milk to clean my hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>However, my hair felt clean.  </li>
      <li>i love your oil so much..</li>
      <li>I really liked both products so far.</li>
      <li>I was more pleased than the african shea moisture shampoo b/c</li>
      <li>So far, as promised, my hair is soft and the products smell great.</li>
      <li>I will forever be a loyal customer.</li>
      <li>I received the items quickly.</li>
      <li>The only issue I have with the shampoo is that I wish there was a better smell, but it&#x27;s not a bad strong smell.  </li>
      <li>it detangled using my hands only i had to take before and after pictures because the difference was so amazing.</li>
      <li>Both products are worth trying.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>- I use it up pretty quick.</li>
      <li>(hell, can&#x27;t do it right now.</li>
      <li>all while being very soft to the touch and easy to run my fingers through.  </li>
      <li>So, I&#x27;m forced to be jealous of my friend&#x27;s beautiful hair.</li>
      <li>My hair was bouncy, soft yet felt strong.  </li>
      <li>I love shimas shampoo because after u rinse you hair and air dry its very very soft and super clean.</li>
      <li>I also love the leave-in conditioner, it takes out all the tangles and makes it totally easier to comb.    </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I can not say enough about the Shima shampoo and leave-in conditioner/detangler I recently started using.  The ingredients are phenomenal and it leaves my hair looking thicker and stronger all while being very soft to the touch and easy to run my fingers through.  I think the marketing could use some tweaking but I will be telling all of my friends about Shima!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: As much as I really am impressed with the ingredients in the shampoo, you have to use a good deal of it for it to work as suggested.  I am convinced the detangler and oil are the best on the market and it doesn&#x27;t take much of either of those to achieve a desired look.  So I&#x27;m going to continue to use the detangler and oil and I&#x27;ll use a goats milk shampoo bar from Sassy goats milk to clean my hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> So far, as promised, my hair is soft and the products smell great. I could not really afford the product but I desperately needed something that would moisturize and stop hair breakage YESTERDAY. The hairline cream is amazing! I press my hair and keep it straight by mixing the Shima oil with the hairline cream and voila, silky soft nearly bone straight hair. It will stay that way even when I would have normally sweat out my press leaving a mini afro at the roots. Not with the hairline cream and Shima oil mixture, it stays straight. Wow.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is amazing as well and my hair is so silky soft when it is wet that I almost don&#x27;t need the detangling spray. Honestly I was skeptical, especially when I read the reviews. I mean, how could almost everyone that tries this product like it so much?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just before purchasing this product I read the reviews and watched the videos on You Tube for a few weeks. I came across a review on the Amazon site that said, \\&quot;Just try it. It really works, I am not kidding, it works!\\&quot; There were many good reviews and the products were natural. I decided to try it but was praying really hard that I was not wasting God&#x27;s money on something that did not work. Ladies, it WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to keeping all my growth and not loose it to the snap, crackle and pop of dry hair breaking off in my fingers each time I touch my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God Bless you Shima for thinking of men and women of color and making a product that REALLY WORKS.</li>
    <li> I have been using the shima oil for awhile now and I absolutely LOVE it. It gives my hair just the right amount of moisture  and shine an I also love the conditioner. My hair is so much healthier since I have been using it. It has become a  part of my daily hair regimen. Shimas products are wonderful.</li>
    <li> This is my second time purchasing the shampoo, but the first time I purchased the leave in condition. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about the shampoo because it didn&#x27;t sud up in my hair a great deal.  I didn&#x27;t use that much.  However, my hair felt clean.  As soon as I rinsed it out, if felt the difference.  Normally after washing, my hair is still left with some type of residue.  There was none.  There was no sticky feeling, no oily feeling, and my hair didn&#x27;t feel hard at all.  The only issue I have with the shampoo is that I wish there was a better smell, but it&#x27;s not a bad strong smell.  I am just girly and I like more flowery type smells.  I then used the leave in conditioner and it helped detangle my hair without a problem.  I parted it in sections and combed it easily, just as instructed.  Once my hair dried, it was soft and manageable.  It was free flowing and full of body. I would purchase this product again either from Amazon or from the Shima website.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have heard a lot about this product. but I am still skeptical of it.over the years I have followed a lot of buzzes about products that miss leads me. I hope that by winning  I will have a chance to try it. And  promise I will come back to this page with a different review.</li>
    <li> Hi shima,  i have been following you for a while now...i love your products..ive purchased the oil, conditioner and shampoo...they are the best....i dont know why i didn&#x27;t find you before but i am glad that you are one of my hair inspirations....the shampoo smell so good and plus it makes my hair easy to comb when washing out...the leave in conditioner is a must have...i can&#x27;t wait to order more products from you..Keep doing the good work...God Bless...</li>
    <li> I purchased Shima&#x27;s hair products about 3 weeks ago which included the Shima Oil, Shima Shampoo, Shima Hairline Cream, and Shima Leave-In Conditioner. Within the first use of the Shima Oil I felt a difference in my hair. When I used the Shima Shampoo my hair felt so silky as I was washing my hair I thought to myself WOW. So I proceeded to wash the shampoo out of my hair and it still felt slippery and smooth, so I was wondering did I not wash this out correctly? Usually when I use a great feeling shampoo as soon as I rinse it out my hair feels hard again. I completely washed out the Shima Shampoo and my hair was left feeling silky smooth. I honestly didn&#x27;t see any hair in the drain and I could run my fingers through it as if I detangled it already. I would say give her products a try to me it&#x27;s worth it. My mother is a professional stylist and she even uses and LOVES Shima products! I usually use Mizani and Shima&#x27;s line of products are 20x better!</li>
    <li> Well.. i love shima oil the most.. its amazing as i said before it did mirecale to my hair.. my hair is super full and my daughter who is only 8 month is using it too.. and its growing fast like no others.. thank you shima.. i love your oil so much.. but my next purchase would be her shampoo and leave in condition and the cream.. the whole set..i want my daughter to look way beautiful then i.. love her more than i.. she is my life.. yet shima oil saved my daughter hair.. thank you shima..</li>
    <li> Hi, I will be the first to review this product, so I will do my best to be sincere.  I received the Shima Hair Repair shampoo during an online win from a youtube natural hair contest when this was first launched.  I personally have NL or SL (shoulder length) natural hair and this product is my personal protein boost!  My hair hates protein so I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable buying a repair shampoo (b/c they are usually enriched in protein).  Well, I&#x27;ll be damned if my hard didn&#x27;t get hard, but actually softened and detangled.  I used two lathers and the first was to cleanse my scalp, and my second lather was to detangle and twist my hair in five sections (to rinse).  I was more pleased than the african shea moisture shampoo b/c I had no stripping feeling and it didn&#x27;t leave my hair tangled or matted like this giovanni tea tree shampoo that I wasted a lot of money on. I actually would love to try the leave in conditioner since it has been released.</li>
    <li> i honestly believe that Shima Oil has been a great addition to my healthy hair regime. I would like to try other products from  the line in the future.</li>
    <li> I use all 4 of Shima&#x27;s Hair care products. I live in Europe with hard water supplies. Ever since I started using this product, I have noted that my hair always is manageable (eventhough I am WEEKS post relaxer), I get complements from strangers stating that my hair looks healthy, shiny AND NOT GREASY! My hair doesn&#x27;t smell pungent...I am a health professional who deals with hundreds of clients on a regular basis therefore my appearance needs to look good. My hair is soft and I do NOT need LOTs of the product to achieve my results. My hair is below shoulder length and I use my BIGHAIR styler by Revlon on the low heat setting to perfect my results 1-2x every fortnight. The hair creme helps to give a more sleeker edge finish and I really have nothing to complain about. I truly believe in this product and have only used it for a month. I already have orders in for more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: May 27th 2013&lt;br /&gt;Ok, I used this product for a few months and to be frank, I got rid of everything. It wasn&#x27;t working for my hair and my needs. I HAD believed that the product was a miracle but on reflection, I think I was in my honey moon period. I have found that hair growers such as Jeni at &#x27;Justgrowalready&#x27; show you how to do hair for dryer and tighter hair curls. I found Shima&#x27;s products would oil my hair, but the lotion just wet it and then it dried out really badly. Definitely not worth my money...</li>
    <li> The hair repair shampoo is so good! I wish it was available in a bigger bottle now that is has become my shampoo of choice and I&#x27;m not switching shampoos so often - I use it up pretty quick. Not only does it have great moisturizing properties but I noticed my hair is a lot stronger (must be the protein). My co-workers didn&#x27;t believe me when I told them about the Shima Hair Care system but now they always say \\&quot;your hair is growing like a weed!\\&quot; I give this shampoo an A++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have the Shima Hairline Creme and of course the Shima Oil! Everything in this line works great together.</li>
    <li> I just reviewed a Shima oil, and so far is good.  The only things I do not understand, Shima Shampoo you can use it one time a week until you hair is repair, but what about the other days, what type of shampoo you have to use during the days you are not using Shima repair Shampoo ????????? If works If I using different shampoo. ????  Shima should make also a daily shampoo.  So I can say, give a try !</li>
    <li> After trying many products on the market and feeling disappointed and depressed, I found SHIMA! I watched her YouTube videos ([...]) for weeks before I ever purchased, but I am so glad that I did. I bought her entire line of products: Shima Oil, Leave-in Conditioner, Hairline creme oil, and the shampoo. I have to admit that I love the healthy direction my hair is going. Listen to Shima and follow her directions when protecting your hair. My hair has already grown and I&#x27;ve been using it only a month!    Her oil is not greasy and it actually penetrates the hair and keeps it moisterized all day long. I also love the leave-in conditioner, it takes out all the tangles and makes it totally easier to comb.    Thanks Shima!!!      Joni</li>
    <li> I have been using Shima&#x27;s hair repair shampoo and conditioner and I must say the results are amazing!!  My hair feels so soft and is much stronger since using these products.  I absolutely love how healthy, soft and strong my hair has become since using the shampoo and leave in conditioner.  I would highly recommend purchasing these products, you will be very pleased with the results!</li>
    <li> I just hooked up a friend of mine on the wonderful hair sites and youtube vids. I told her that she needs to get in touch w/ Shima. So, she did. Now I&#x27;ve been a follower and subscriber for a long time now, but no funds to get products. However, my gal pal had just purchased the oil to start off with. She LOVES IT. So she told me about it. Yes, I should have been the first one to try and tell her, but just couldn&#x27;t do it at the time (hell, can&#x27;t do it right now. Son just graduated from high school). However, being the wonderful friend she is, she gave me a sample of her Shima oil. OMG! My hair is right above my shoulders, its thick 4b type and its relaxed. OH my, talk about in love!  So, I&#x27;ll be saving (more of) my pennies for this. It wasn&#x27;t greasy, it lasted all day. Especially in the humidity we&#x27;re having here now in the Eastern part of the country. So, I&#x27;m forced to be jealous of my friend&#x27;s beautiful hair. But I know soon, I&#x27;ll be able to have gorgeous hair too!   :)[[ASIN:B0052YPJ7S Shima Hair Repair Shampoo and Leave-in Conditioner Set (8oz)!]]</li>
    <li> when i had damage hair from a revlon dye last december i used the shima shampoo to repair my hair and it help tremendously because of how gentle it is. i have used the shima oil in the past as well and upon using it the first time i felt my scalp tingling and then hair growing rapidly this was of course while my hair was in a protective style. these producats are made with quality ingridients to make the hair journey easier.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. The shampoo itself detangles my hair. It leaves my hair super soft. I can see results already with my hair looking alot healthier.I use the conditioner everyday just to spray on my hair. I love all of Shima hair products.They really are amazing. When you start using Shima hair products you will see a different in your hair.</li>
    <li> At first when I had received the shima hair shampoo I was shocked to see the directions said apply to dry hair for best results mainly because I ALWAYS shampoo my hair wet, but honestly I was willing to do anything because i was suffering from so much breakage, after using the shampoo my hair was soft and manageable and that&#x27;s a lot coming from someone 6 months post relaxer! Then, using the leave in conditioner left my hair very soft and moisturized even before oiling my hair and scalp and I could run a comb through it very easily. It gave my hair a lot of slip while stretching my relaxer. I will def buy these products again. The only thing I wasn&#x27;t crazy about was the smell, but I do like that these are not extremely heavy products that will weigh down my hair.</li>
    <li> It was after it did nothing that I realized ALL the great reviews seemed so fake....LOL you guys got me...I was a fool ...maybe I can save the real customers some money</li>
    <li> I initially loved the idea of this combo...and as a natural woman whom was new to the whole ingredients game, I went off of youtube videos.....unfortunately, these products were quite stripping on my hair. My hair dry 2hole washing my hair....and that was while I had shampoo in it....it felt dry, stripped, just....like this product was too harsh for me. After further research and reading Teri Laflesh&#x27;s book, I now know what my hair requires. Shima&#x27;s video is informative, long, but informative...however, the shampoo and conditioner..wasn&#x27;t to my liking.</li>
    <li> I have used alot of products and i mean alot. I love shimas shampoo because after u rinse you hair and air dry its very very soft and super clean. The leave in conditioner should really be called a de tangler because after my sister permed her hair she didnt add anything over night and it looked like she applied sprints on it, it was very dry...as soon as i sprayed shimas leave in conditioner it detangled using my hands only i had to take before and after pictures because the difference was so amazing. The oil is very light and does the job, i use on everything. I am so happy i saw your video on youtube much success to you. I will forever be a loyal customer.</li>
    <li> I have purchased both the shampoo and leave in conditioner a couple of months ago.  The conditioner is great at detangling my hair after I wash it.   The shampoo is thick, smells great, and lathers well.  Both products are worth trying.</li>
    <li> The first time I used it, my hair was dry/damaged from not moisturizing my hair right, in kinky twist, therefore It seemed as if the oil wasnt heavy enough. The oil is very light. I would like to try the hair line creme in the near future.</li>
    <li> The longer I left the shampoo in the silkier my hair got. I was surprised to find this out. This shampoo truly beat out my other shampoos hands down.  The leave in works wonderful with the shampoo for my roller sets.  My hair was bouncy, soft yet felt strong.  I also didn&#x27;t have any shedding or breakage in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one can speak for me and I say these products are superior.  If you don&#x27;t know how to use them a person can&#x27;t say others are not telling the truth of their own experience.  That just doesn&#x27;t make since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great job Shima!!!</li>
    <li> The oil makes my hair looks wet and it smells. I really thought this was a good item butnit was not. Can i get my money back?</li>
    <li> just follow her instructions.  don&#x27;t pay attention to how she is saying it, she is telling the truth.  It does work.</li>
    <li> I have been using Shima Oil for close to a year now, and I must say that my natural hair has grown faster than it has in the past! My usually course hair has become softer and more manageable. I give this product 5 stars! I would recommend it to all women of color.</li>
    <li> Oh wow, I didn&#x27;t know this was sold amazon until now!  I got the shima oil and shampoo at the Atlanta hair show.  She was sooooooooooooooooo freakin nice and her hair is beautiful!  I got the oil thinking I would just try it but that i would really weigh down my relaxed hair, but I honest was surprised.  I use this daily on my edges and my ends.  I use the oil before blow drying now whenever I flat iron b/c if adds so much shine and never weighs my hair down!  The shampoo smells really good, and never left residue, but made my hair feel really strong like aphogee.  I really liked both products so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d heard a lot (good and bad) about the Shima hair line and when she was featured in Sister2Sister magazine I thought I&#x27;d give her products a try. I have all natural afro kinky/curly hair. I received the items quickly. They were packaged nicely. I knew the hairline cream was a joke as soon as I saw how thin and runny it was. The one and only way the hairline cream would lay down my hairline is if I wrapped my edges after I put it on. I could&#x27;ve used plain water and wrapped my hairline and gotten the same results. I&#x27;ve used all natural pomades and never had to wrap my hairline. The leave-in left my hair feeling stripped...it was a weird feeling. It made my hair tangle very badly I mean absolutely no slippage no matter how much of the leave-in I put on my hair. I used it once on one section of my hair and that was it. I had to use another product on top of the leave in. The shampoo is very stripping as well and left my hair very very dry. The only thing I did like was the oil and I will probably continue to use it. Also, who ever said her products smell good is a bold face lie. I don&#x27;t really care about a products&#x27; smell so long as it isn&#x27;t offensive and the product does what it says. Her products have a tolerable smell but they do not smell good. Shima&#x27;s hair products did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Used the hair oil and I had felt that if stripped my hair follicles.  My hair was not smooth at all.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo was good</li>
    <li> I prefer the shima oil. I tried the shampoo and leave-in and it kind of makes my hair feel hard/coarse. I have very soft hair. I experience a little shedding with the leave in moreso than the shampoo. The video included is very helpful. I will continue to use the shima oil. It&#x27;s more of a staple product for me.</li>
    <li> Shima really cares about your hair and products are very quality and sulfate free and good for hair care.  Once again I don&#x27;t like the fragrance but if you can get over that these are outstanding.</li>
    <li> This is more then my expectations. My hair was in really...really bad shape. I was willing to try almost anything and believe me...I&#x27;ve tried so many others. I can almost swear my hair is 100% better and it&#x27;s growing back. My husband noticed it too.I don&#x27;t know what happened to my hair (which length was pass my shoulders). It literally just started thinning out and falling out! I could take my hand and just pull it out. I was scared to comb my hair. I had long strands over here, long strands over there. You get the picture...! My hair just started coming out in handfuls and no-one could tell me WHY!. I asked Doctors, Beauticians, family and friends for help. THE ANSWERS: It could be your meds, over processed, the produces you&#x27;re using. heritage (does it run in your family?)....oh yeah, and &amp;#34;maybe your wear your &#x27;ATTITUDES&amp;#34; (my wigs) to much. Your scalp needs air! WHAT? .{*~*}.  So listening to what was said about Shima Hair products on utube...I said what the heck......let&#x27;s give it a try. I cut off all the rest of the long strands except for in the lower back right side (as a reminded of what once was)....! It&#x27;s been about maybe a month. I really wished I had documented everything but I really wasn&#x27;t expecting anything good out of this either, but my hair is thicker, it feels so good and yes it&#x27;s growing....I love it...Thank you for having produces that really works!
