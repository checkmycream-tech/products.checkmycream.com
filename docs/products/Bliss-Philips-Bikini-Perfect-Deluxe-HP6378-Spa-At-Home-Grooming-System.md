      <li>Awesome trimmer still have mine after many years.</li>

      <li>All in all, I think this is a very nice product that has good results</li>
      <li>The good news is I didn&#x27;t have any razor burn or ingrown hairs afterwards</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a 2 year warranty which is good.</li>
      <li>and I found they work good and get the hair like they are supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>For this price it&#x27;s a good buy and one that I can see myself using often.</li>
      <li>good for people who want to maintain not get rid of everything.</li>

      <li>Good quality product.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise good to use on those precision shaping areas</li>
      <li>- A fair number of attachments:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
      <li>With the number of attachments and razor heads, good illustrations and instructions matching the quality of the product itself would provide a polished presentation.  </li>
      <li>Kinda like using one of those no powered push mowers when you have a perfectly good gas guzzler in the garage that you could be using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;It also comes with the grooming system which is really cool for a perfect bikini look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>How very pleased I am that I made that choice.  </li>
      <li>a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with the fact that this device is cordless and rechargeable.  </li>
      <li>I honestly don&#x27;t even think it did that much of a good job at trimming either.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe people are giving this thing more than one star!</li>
      <li>I LOVE it!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I was pretty impressed with this product.  </li>
      <li>Best to use when trimming hair for the first time.  </li>
      <li>I love this kit!</li>
      <li>Well, surprisingly, I got a very smooth shave with no razor</li>
      <li>The microshaver head is equally effective, and gives a great smooth finish.    </li>
      <li>Though it&#x27;s effective, I would recommend waxing over use of the epilating head.  </li>
      <li>Make your own call depending on your budget and priority.    </li>
      <li>And the body butter was nice too.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice that the shaver is water resistant.</li>
      <li>Especially useful to trim eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thus it is a one of a kind item.</li>
      <li>the samples are kind of moot.</li>

      <li>This flesh mangling looking attachment effectively removes hair by the root.</li>
      <li>I had hoped that perhaps the eyebrow attachment would be handy for shaping my eyebrows, so I could forgo continued plucking via tweezers.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love love love this product.  no more heading to the salon for a wax that costs an arm and a leg and lasts three days.  I can do a better job with this product.  It is a must have for summertime and vacations.  I have had mine for 7 years and it still works great.  I also give this to friends for a bacholerette gift.  :-)</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this product for a few weeks now and refuses to use anything else!  She previously used blades, wax, whatever, but the bliss system has spoiled her.  The texture of the device is great, and the attachments help her do ev</li>
    <li> Could not send it back -- had to CUT open the package to try it  Could not give it any stars BUT...........  You force me to place a star in order to be able to send my remarks</li>
    <li> I think this is a nifty little gadget but am not exactly sure it was worth the hefty $80 price tag it cost me to order it (and pay shipping) from Sephora. Aside from the Bliss goodness and cuteness factor, I bought it mostly for the epilator which I had never used before. I am a devoted waxer and can see myself using this in between waxings but would definitely NOT recommend this for someone who has never waxed before. It doesn&#x27;t remove enough hair at once and you will just prolong your pain and suffering. Go to a professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised to see how much hair it was able to remove from my underarms with only 2 days of regrowth from shaving considering I could barely see anything myself. It did a great job there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyebrow trimmer is a bit useless considering my brows are barely long enough to be trimmed on even the shortest setting and I found the micro shaver did nothing for my bikini line prickles but did a great job on my underarms. The regular trimmer seemed pretty average to me. The Bliss samples smell amazing, but the bag is just made out of that cheap reusable grocery bag material and doesn&#x27;t have pockets or anything to keep the attachments organized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;d say if you are looking for a trimmer...just go buy a trimmer. If you are looking for waxed results...go find an esthetician. If you are a bikini grooming veteran looking to maintain results at home then go get this...but maybe wait until it&#x27;s on sale.</li>
    <li> I bought this mainly for the epilator as a means to cut back on trips to the salon to get waxed. While it&#x27;s no wax replacement, it does a decent job of hair removal and is probably best used as an \\&quot;in between visits\\&quot; tool. Is it painful? Well, yes. You&#x27;re pulling hair out by the root, that&#x27;s never pleasant. Is it terribly painful? No worse than a Brazilian really.   I&#x27;ve also used the shaver a couple of times for under arms - not impressed, and clippers for trimming - seem to work ok.</li>
    <li> I finally tried this set and am extremely impressed.  The shave was close and didn&#x27;t give me razor burn.  The trimmer is great too.  My oly complaint is that the comb part kept falling off while I was using it.  Otherwise I would have given it a 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> I love this kit! If you are looking for something for your legs (other then the Epilator) then this isn&#x27;t the product for you. This kit is awesome for your bikini line and around it. I LOVE it! The Epilator does hurt, but wow, does it work! However, I don&#x27;t have the patience for it. So I use the rest around my bikni line and it works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> NOT  WORTH THE MONEY $$$$$ OVER PRICED AND  THE ATTACHMENTS  POP OFF ..... NO MORE  I WANT MY MONEY  BACK  AMAZON  !</li>
    <li> For half a hundred dollars you get a neat packaged \\&quot;grooming system\\&quot; offered in partnership with Bliss and Philips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT&#x27;S INSIDE / COMMENTS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- A rechargeable shower-friendly PERSONAL TRIMMER.  I have to stress on the \\&quot;personal\\&quot; aspect due to it&#x27;s size which is light and handy to use all over your body that has less than decent amount of hair.  I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using this product other than trimming unless you want to dull the blades and spend all day.  For that, I would go find a \\&quot;professional\\&quot; line and go to a Spa first so you can do fine and follow-up adjustments as hair grows back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- PRECISION COMB. Best to use when trimming hair for the first time.  Has 5 adjustable settings depending on hair growth and length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- MICRO SHAVER.  Use after having removed most hair with the Precision Comb.  This then creates a smoother shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- EPILIATOR.  One word, ouch!  Something you have to get used to.  For best results the manufacturer suggests using this attachment for hair that has grown between 2 to 5 mm in length.  If lower than 2mm then the epilator may prove ineffective.  For longer hair, trim first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- MICRO TRIMMER.  To remove that single stray hair.  Especially useful to trim eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- PRECISION TRIMMER.  The tool to use for shaping.  Because this is where final results come in, best if used in a dry environment where hair is it&#x27;s normal growing position.  Enough said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- EYEBROW COMB.  For those scary-looking patch of eyebrows, trim them down to a uniform length.  Best to start with the a high setting to avoid trimming your eyebrows down to nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- You get a neat little so-called BEAUTY BAG to dump all the products inside (literally, as there are no compartments).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONSUMABLES:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- BLISS INGROWN HAIR ELIMINATING PEELING PADS.  Phew. Product use as titled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- BLISS BODY BUTTER.  A moisturizer that contains coconut oil, Vitamin A &amp; E, and comes in fresh citrus scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- BLISS BODY SCRUB.  This product, like most respective body scrubs, help lift away dead skin cells to create a smoother skin. Highly recommended to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price is just right for a personal trimmer.  Although some of the parts are a little bit flimsy which I fear may wear or break easily.  I would suggest creating an ULTIMATE line which features better materials including Titanium and Aluminum for a longer-lasting investment.  Also, the colour of the product is great.  However, the bag could have been designed a little bit more thoughtful with compartments and pockets to hold each of the accessories provided above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, the idea is to patronize the Bliss line of personal care products as you continue to use the Philips Personal Trimmer device.  With the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.  With the further investment on Bliss products, it&#x27;s just like a PRINTER AND INK/TONER purchase.  The initial price is affordable.  The replacement is where it gets you.  But the results are fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make your own call depending on your budget and priority.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars because you can&#x27;t go wrong with the price and features.scrubs, help lift away dead skin cells to create a smoother skin.

    <li> I think this is a great product.  It&#x27;s much more trimmer than Bliss product- but the lotion that comes with it is very nice and effective, even though I personally associate citrus with stinging and this was not the case.    There are many attachments and although this product is a little pricey, I&#x27;ve been needing something like this and it will basically do anything you need it to do. I have not tried the epilator yet because I&#x27;m scared of it.</li>
    <li> love it. plain and simple.  breakdown: eyebrow trimmer works very well just start with the longer end and work ur way down. the trimmer attachment works very well. be very careful with the trimmer without the guard, maybe im just new with a trimmer but it hurts quite a bit when it catches. for the harder to reach areas the micro trimmer is a lot better. the epilator is a blessing for me having a full sized one for my legs and this one cleans the edges up a lot better and less painful than my braun also for those who are brave its better on my underarms than my braun as well. now the shaver is just plain crappy. i can usually get a good hour or so out of it ive even gotten an hour and a half before. i do love the wet/dry option. the pouch makes keeping everything together very easy.  very worth the price. good for people who want to maintain not get rid of everything. side note theres a full two year warrenty from philips.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this!  I was a little scared of the epilator but now I&#x27;m thinking it is my favorite feature.  The eyebrow trimmer is great too!  Everything else included is to be expected.  The only downside I see is that if you run out of batteries you aren&#x27;t able to use the unit plugged into the wall.  I will get over that though :)</li>
    <li> I got this product after one too many cuts down below with a sharp pair of scissors and boy was I missing out.  This product is great for trimming hair quickly to uniform length in a few minutes (vs. 30 + with a comb and scissors) + without the cutting factor.  I really like the comb attachments which are easy to use freely without having to see everything you are doing.  The micro-trimmer is ok but still did not feel it was close enough to forego the traditional razor.  The epilator is very painful and all I could get done was a couple inches of the bikini line before abandoning the idea all together.  I always wondered why no one had invented a women&#x27;s personal groomer and now I am happy someone did.  I would highly recommend this product for the comb attachments alone but it does have enough tools that if motivated, you could get very creative.</li>
    <li> I purchased mainly for the epilator function, which can do better. The head is too small, but I can live with that, but it lack the precision that I got accustomed to from a Philips epilator. I have to pass multiple times on the same spot so that it removes all the hair. Overall is a good product, and considering I don&#x27;t have any alternative (no other Philips epilators are sold in US and Braun are horrible - to noisy and they remove the hair in such a manner it makes me bleed) I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> This is a great little all in one tool!  You can use it for so many things.  It&#x27;s also very well-made and comes with a charger so no batteries needed.  Great product!  I&#x27;m not sure how I lived without it.</li>
    <li> I like this little device as a trimmer. I bought the target version, which has less attachments, I think it only has the microshaver, the trimmer, and the trimmer head. For trimming, it works well, although it is too easy to accidently switch trimming lengths while using it and this can result in looking a bit silly. Absolutely no irritation from trimming. However, the one downside is that it takes 10 hours to charge. Yes, you heard that right, 10 hours for 60 minutes of total shave time. That&#x27;s a bit extreme for my tastes.</li>
    <li> This set has a lot of options, but it was very hard not to get lots of knicks. I have gone back to my old cheaper electric razor.</li>
    <li> For some reason when reading the product description I had in my mind that this was more than a trimmer, but also a shaver. But it&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So first off realize this is a trimmer that can be used on different parts of your body, not just the eyebrows and bikini line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con - The manual was a 20inch x 24inch, multi-folded piece of brown paper made of the thinnest paper material possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con - I really disliked the manual for the fact that the information on each attachment is simply a lame explanation of how to connect each accessory, but no mention as to it&#x27;s preferred use. I had to refer to the back of the thrown away packaging to get a suggestion on how each attachment is intended to be used&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con - Only 1 Bliss ingrown hair eliminating peeling pad included. Could have put at least 5 or six in the set to give people time to use the trimmer while waiting for the online order of more pads to be delivered&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro - I expected the Bliss lemon+sage body butter to be greasy and have an unwelcome aroma. It was neither.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro - Provided with a handy little tie-string bag to carry the shaver and accessories in&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro - Wet or dry use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro - A fair number of attachments:&lt;br /&gt;1) Precision Trimmer - Groom the bikini line; worked on my beard too&lt;br /&gt;2) Precision Comb - A plastic guard that has 5 length settings. This works best with any hair 1/4 inch or longer, since the guard is kinda thick. The advantage of the guard is to provide a more even cut&lt;br /&gt;3) Epilator - Scary attachment that makes one jump in pain when used, like getting a finger pricked. This flesh mangling looking attachment effectively removes hair by the root. I recommend taking an ice-cube and numbing the desired area a bit before use to reduce the jolting discomfort&lt;br /&gt;4) Micro Shaver - Seemed to trim/cut nothing of consequence. Kinda worthless. Maybe its meant for peach fuzz, but I couldn&#x27;t seem to figure out what value add it was&lt;br /&gt;5) Micro Trimmer - Defined as. . .&amp;#34;Shapes and defines eyebrows or removes a single hair&amp;#34;. Only removes a single hair if no other hairs are within 1/4inch distance of the one you want to remove. Otherwise good to use on those precision shaping areas&lt;br /&gt;6) Eyebrow Comb - Another plastic guard to keep things the same length&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;As a trimmer it works great. My wife even used the main trimmer to tidy up the hairline after giving our 3 boys a haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the attachments are a more hype than anything, unless you have a very specific use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When searching Amazon.com for &amp;#34;trimmer&amp;#34;, this is one of the few that isn&#x27;t meant for a head of hair. Thus it is a one of a kind item. So if you have that special grooming need, this may be right up your alley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have expected to pay $30 for this product, but I think the fact the trimmer is water-proof justifies the extra cost.s&lt;br /&gt;5) Micro Trimmer - Defined as. . .&amp;#34;Shapes and defines eyebrows or removes a single hair&amp;#34;.

    <li> Bliss, the spa people, and Philips, the electric grooming gadget people, have teamed up to create this Bikini Perfect Deluxe Spa-at-Home grooming system that should, theoretically, meet the needs of just about any woman, no matter what her taste in bikini coiffure. There are a lot of options. The groomer has 6 attachments: a precision trimmer, a micro shaver, a micro trimmer, an epilator, and two combs, one for bikini area and one for eyebrows, that fit over the trimmers, allowing you to trim hair to a uniform length. The apparatus is rechargeable using the included adapter and cord. Ten hours of charge gets you 35 minutes of use, but no batteries required. With an attachment on it, the groomer is about 6 ¼ inches (16 cm) long and 1 ½ inches (4 cm) wide, with a comfortable grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t normally shave. I wax. I was hoping that this grooming system would provide a convenient way to touch up between waxes and an easy method for cropping hair to the desired length. The precision trimmer is for shaping the bikini line. It trims hair very short but not flush with skin. You&#x27;re supposed to clean up the stubble with the micro shaver, which has a foil, like a tiny electronic razor. Unfortunately, the precision trimmer works very poorly. It catches only a minority of hairs, so I had to go back over the area umpteen times and never did get most hairs. The micro trimmer is even worse. It does nothing for stubble at all. You&#x27;ll have to break out a conventional razor to finish the job. I was concerned that these implements might irritate my sensitive skin, but they don&#x27;t do much of anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer does work when coupled with the precision comb, however. This is a clear plastic piece that fits over the precision trimmer and can be set to 5 positions for the desired length of hair. Each position trims a little longer than the instructions say, so play around with it to find the length you want. It doesn&#x27;t catch every hair, but does get most of them. You may have to go over an area more than once. This works fine for cropping pubic hair, and, although I didn&#x27;t find it easier than using scissors, it may be safer. It&#x27;s impossible to catch your flesh in the trimmer with the comb attached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise, the microtrimmer, which is intended for shaping eyebrows, works efficiently. It whacks off every hair with which it comes in contact, so don&#x27;t mess around with it while you&#x27;re in a morning stupor. You could lose an eyebrow. Since it was working so well, I decided to try it on my bikini area, where the larger precision trimmer had failed so spectacularly. Bad idea. It pinches when used on the bikini area. There is an eyebrow comb attachment for the microtrimmer, which is supposed to trim your eyebrow hairs to a uniform length of your choosing. I didn&#x27;t try this, as I like the natural length of my eyebrows just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also an epilator attachment. This is one of those things that spins round and round and plucks hairs from their follicles. I am very comfortable with waxing, but I won&#x27;t go near an epilator. I hadn&#x27;t tried one since the early days of epilators, when I found them painful and inefficient. This epilator is less painful and more efficient that the old models that I remember. It&#x27;s not horrible. But you still have to go over the area multiple times to remove all the hairs, and it doesn&#x27;t work as well on coarse pubic hair as on other parts of the body. I can&#x27;t compare it to other epilators since I haven&#x27;t used the latest models, but I can&#x27;t recommend epilators in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The groomer with all its attachments is supposed to be suitable for use in the shower. I didn&#x27;t use it in the shower, as I&#x27;d rather have better light to see by when taking sharp instruments to my body parts. So I just held it under the shower. Nothing bad happened to the groomer, but I nearly dropped it a couple of times. Philips needs to put some grippers on it if they seriously intend this thing to beused in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are on an enormous fold-out of flimsy pulp paper that would disintegrate if wet, with illustrations no where near the description that they illustrate. Bliss or Philips should have made a slick instruction booklet with a page dedicated to each attachment, including illustrations. The fold-out is a nuisance, and it&#x27;s difficult to find the information that I&#x27;m looking for. The groomer comes with an aqua-colored bag to house it and all its parts, a small 1 fl oz tube of Bliss Lemon-Sage Body Butter, and one sample of Ingrown Hair Eliminating Peeling Pads. The Body Butter is a moderately heavy moisturizer, and Lemon-Sage is one of Bliss&#x27; nicest scents. The groomer has a 2-year warranty on materials and workmanship.ons are on an enormous fold-out of flimsy pulp paper that would disintegrate if wet, with illustrations no where near the description that they illustrate.

    <li> I would have never guessed it from the product description, but my husband and I use this product equally. He has a beard and mustache, and this works great as a cordless trimmer. As for female uses, the epilator hurts just like you think it will. It&#x27;s nice that the shaver is water resistant. The manual is cheap, but other than that this is a nice, if sometimes painful, product at a good price.</li>
    <li> I have tried it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried at home waxing - which resulted in many hours of pain, sticking to everything under the sun and no hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried professional waxing - which left me with blisters because the pro didn&#x27;t realize how hot the wax was, she told me that was part of the \\&quot;pain.\\&quot;  This was right before my wedding, imagine MY mortification on how to describe why my nether regions were welted, blistered and weeping?  NOT GOOD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried NADS - can we say BRUISING?!  Yeah.  That hurt too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried Nair - doesn&#x27;t work worth a darn and leaves a lingering odor in your nose for months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried normal old shaving - works to a point but razor burn to the point of can barely tolerate undies... yowza!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw the next-step-down of this at Target today and figured, why not?  It was around $40 and only has the two heads (precision and micro) with the guard.  No epilady, which is probably a good thing as the reviews here aren&#x27;t so hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I charged it for a little while (from the reviews it appears I need to charge it for longer) and went off to the bathroom to see if I was going to be ripped off again.  To my surprise, utter surprise, it actually WORKS (!) and is pretty much pain free.  This little gizmo is AMAZING.  While you are not going to be baby-booty smooth, you are going to be \\&quot;can go on the beach\\&quot; smooth and much happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I get really bad razor burn I&#x27;ll come back and change the review but for now I&#x27;m one happy camper!  4 stars is because it isn&#x27;t baby smooth but 4 out of 5 on the smooth scale!</li>
    <li> This thing tore my skin to shreds.  I don&#x27;t even need to say anymore than that.  I returned this immediately.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the girlfriend so she could trim up...down under.  It worked like a charm, so close there was hardly nothing left to shave.  No nicks, runs or errors even on the most sensitive parts that would normally be covered by a Bikini.  Good quality product.  I&#x27;m Duke and I approve this endorsement.</li>
    <li> I was really psyched to get this trimmer.  I have been using an electic Remington shaver for years.  That has always given me a close shave down there but it&#x27;s so big.  I was expecting this trimmer to also give me a close shave but figured it would be easier to use since it has small attachments.  I was wrong.  This is only a trimmer and you will be left with stubble.  I&#x27;m guessing only the epilator will make you smooth but I didn&#x27;t use that attachment.  I&#x27;m not into pain.  I called Philips and they have been very helpful with returning the product so hopefully I will get most of my money back.  If you need a trimmer, I suppose this may work for you.  I honestly don&#x27;t even think it did that much of a good job at trimming either.  I really would recommend avoiding this product all together.</li>
    <li> I originally acquired this trimmer for my wife to use, but as it turns out we both use this device equally!  As a beard/moustache trimmer, I find this to be far superior to any of the cordless trimmers I have used that were designed for that purpose alone.  My wife especially likes the various attachments which help to remove hair in \\&quot;difficult\\&quot; areas.  The batteries are extremely high quality and do not need to be recharged very often.  The only minor downside is that the instructions are not great - but they were clear enough I suppose.  Overall a great product at a fair price for what you are getting.</li>
    <li> I really like this kit and the different attachments that come with it. I think the price is reasonable for everything that comes in the kit.    Yes, the epilator hurts, but you are ripping the hair our by the root. If it didn&#x27;t hurt, it would mean that the hair is breaking off, not being pulled out by the root.</li>
    <li> I had purchased a Pansonic personal trimmer about six years ago and definitely got my money&#x27;s worth from it, but it completely died a few months ago.  I had been searching for another, but couldn&#x27;t find any in the local stores (maybe because winter is fast approaching).  I found this Bliss-Phillips personal groomer online and it seemed to have everything I needed and more.  The cost deterred me at first, but there really weren&#x27;t any other options that interested me so I decided to buy this product.  I&#x27;m very happy I did... it is easy to use, clean, and switch attachments. You do need to charge the unit for several hours before using it the first time, and it doesn&#x27;t work when plugged into an A/C outlet (my other one did), but the battery life seems to be pretty good so far.  Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Every woman I know wants an easier way to keep her bikini area trimmed and/or shaved.  When I saw the new Bikini Perfect Deluxe by Bliss-Philips, I had to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with the fact that this device is cordless and rechargeable.  The first charge takes some time to complete, so don&#x27;t expect to use this the same day or night that you bring it home.  You&#x27;ll need to let it charge uninterrupted for at least ten hours, according to the directions, but no more than 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once charged, I settled down to use my Grooming System.  I had hoped that perhaps the eyebrow attachment would be handy for shaping my eyebrows, so I could forgo continued plucking via tweezers.  Alas, that was not to be.  While the unit does boast an eyebrow attachment, it apparently is for trimming eyebrows, not for shaping them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No problem, my main purpose for wanting this device was for the bikini area, so that was disappointing, but not a deal breaker for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I began to do a little landscaping in the bikini area.  The trimmer attachments are great - they work very well to clip the hair at an even length, with little risk of accidentally cutting oneself (although I still advise caution when using in sensitive areas).  This is something I&#x27;ve always used a pair of small hair-cutting scissors for, which is a much scarier procedure since it is hard to see that area when trimming oneself.  To have a device that measures a distance from the skin as it cuts is very reassuring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next I attached the micro shaver and began to shave the areas that need shaving.  This is where I am majorly disappointed.  Although my hair is soft and fine, the micro shaver did not handle shaving well at all.  I finally gave up, determining that simply shaving manually with a razor is much easier than using the micro shaver for the Bikini Perfect Deluxe system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this gadget for trimming, but not for shaving.  Do I recommend it?  Difficult question.  If all you want out of this device is to trim, then you may want it.  If, however, you were relying on it for actual shaving of the pubic area, you will want to pass this one over.want out of this device is to trim, then you may want it.  If, however, you were relying on it for actual shaving of the pubic area, you will want to pass this one over.</li>
    <li> My wife can&#x27;t stop singing the praises of the Bliss-Philips grooming system!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know much myself about all the attachments and what each one of them does, but she says she absolutely loves using it.&lt;br /&gt;I apologize that this isn&#x27;t a more in-depth coverage of the product considering my sex, but the missus is over the moon and to my mind there is no more higher recommendation!</li>
    <li> I really like the idea of having a multi-use tool. I am all for saving space and keeping the bathroom area clean. I was enthused therefore to look at the Bliss-Philips set. It comes organized in a handy blue bag. You simply interchange the heads on the device, which has a plug but can be run without it. It handles all your hair removal needs. What could be better?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are six different attachments for this. Now, they say six attachments, but really there are four. By default it has a flat shaver type attachment. You can use that \\&quot;raw\\&quot; or add on two different plastic guides that ensure only hair of a certain length reaches the shaver. While I appreciate the idea, for example for eyebrows, it is kludgy and doesn&#x27;t work as well as a real eyebrow trimmer does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are then two \\&quot;trimmer\\&quot; heads with zig-zag metal pieces which do the job for ears and bikini areas. The ear one is a little large for that area. So I&#x27;m really not sure that either of these would be any better than a regular razor for these tasks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brings us to the attachment I was literally afraid to try. The epilator. This is a spinning set of discs which literally yanks hairs out - one by one - out of your body. This is PAINFUL. My boyfriend even volunteered to try it for me, since I didn&#x27;t want to try it at first. He agrees on the pain quotient. I understand the theory - that if you rip hairs out by the roots they take a long while to grow back in. However, in practice, ripping hairs out one at a time in a very slow painful process just isn&#x27;t right in my book. It&#x27;s really not fair to blame the Bliss unit for this though. Any epilator is going to have this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also find the super thin instruction booklet to be less than helpful. For a system meant to be used in a wet bathroom, printing the instructions on paper that will dissolve immediately if it gets damp seems odd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is the end decision? It&#x27;s a fairly expensive device when compared with other trimmers. It has lots of exchangeable heads but most are not as good as other devices which are really meant for their use. Still, if you&#x27;re doing general use trimming on bikini areas, beards, or so on, it can be handy to have a unit like this which lets you try a number of different heads to get just the right look. So there is a niche where it is great - but I wouldn&#x27;t throw away the other specialized trimmers in a desire to try to get this one to \\&quot;suit all needs\\&quot;.other trimmers.

    <li> In theory this thing should be great, again Philips has let me down. The trimmers work decent, the epilator is quite small and honestly hurts too much to use on your \\&quot;lady business\\&quot;. The shaver is so small that I can&#x27;t possibly imagine what use it would be for anyone, besides that it doesn&#x27;t work. I am going to return it on Philips 45-day money back guarantee. Which is about the only good thing I have to say about Philips.</li>
    <li> This is amazing!  Just what I&#x27;ve been looking for.  I just ordered one for my daughter &amp; she can&#x27;t wait to get it!  Does a great job...fast, close, easy, effective.  I don&#x27;t EVER want to be without it! It certainly beats razors, depilatories, and waxing.  Lots of options with the various heads but I really don&#x27;t see myself using the epilator.  I had an Emjoi &amp; it was really painful!  Love, love, love it!</li>
    <li> This item was not at all what I expected. The shaving heads barely work, they pull and tear. Very dissapointed</li>
    <li> To be honest, I&#x27;m not very hairy, not really anywhere - but bikini-wise, yep, I could use a little help esp. now that summer draws nigh. Cleaning up my bikini area has always been a dicey proposition at best (like it hurts, it itches, etc., etc.)     It really was just easier to get a more conservative bathing suit than to remove the excess follicles in the nether area.     The Bliss-Philips Bikini Perfect has a ton of extra implements to remove hair just about everywhere (kind of like one would have done at a spa, and that&#x27;s no coincidence.) My issue is that since I&#x27;m not too hairy, most of those add-ons are just a waste.     But I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try the bikini-perfect device. If it didn&#x27;t work, well, I still had enough time to regrow what was removed (and I still have the conservative bathing suit!)    Well, surprisingly, I got a very smooth shave with no razor burn, no itching, and no stubble. Maybe I&#x27;m not the best test case because I&#x27;m not very hirsute, but then I am very prone to bad side effects of bikini hair removal.    For the first time since I started \\&quot;neatening\\&quot; up that area, I suffered absolutely no problems. Just smooth, soft skin, and no pain.    That&#x27;s an excellent result. If you&#x27;re hairier than me - which would pretty much be everybody - you&#x27;ll love this device. You&#x27;ll also get a lot of use out of the eyebrow hair remover, the trimmer, etc.    I&#x27;d just lay off the epilator, bikini-wise or eyebrow-wise. That is more pain than anyone wants to suffer for the sake of hairlessness!</li>
    <li> Hey, maintaining your yard&#x27;ll only make your house look nicer, that&#x27;s what I always say (read into that what you will)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Philips Bliss works for the most part, but it&#x27;s not anything you won&#x27;t find somewhere else.  My wife &amp; I picked this up wanting something to easily &amp; neatly trim our \\&quot;nether brush\\&quot; (wink, wink :P) &amp; thought that all the nifty extensions included with the Bliss would mean money well spent.  We were met with various reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bliss includes 6 extensions, these are our varied thoughts on them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Precision Trimer - This one comes with 2 little gaurds that can each be extended to 3 different lengths.  Truthfully, if your goal is to get rid of the mess; why then use extensions?  Most of them are extended (at least in my opinion) farther than you&#x27;ll ever need.  The trimmer itself works well though.  This is essentially the lawn mower of the extensions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Precision Comb - This worked great, but no better than than the trimmer listed above.  There&#x27;s no real benefit of this attachment.  Kinda like using one of those no powered push mowers when you have a perfectly good gas guzzler in the garage that you could be using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epilator - This has 2 things going against it.  It hurts &amp; it didn&#x27;t seem to work as easily as advertised.  This is essentially just like the \\&quot;As Seen On TV - Tweezy\\&quot; that&#x27;s been hammered into all of our brains 10 times daily on all of our favorite television stations over the past couple months.  The Epilator is supposed to yank your unwanted hair out by the root, hence the pain I mentioned above.  I obviously expected some pain, but the real pain comes from the little metal grinder beating up against your skin, not the actual hair removal itself.  I used it on my wrist (&#x27;cause there&#x27;s just NOOOOO WAY I&#x27;m yanking hair by the root from down there; if you know what I mean) &amp; even there it was not a fun experiance.  The other thing is it didn&#x27;t really seem to work all that well aside from a couple hairs &amp; that was only after applying an extra amount of pressure.  Granted, I didn&#x27;t use this attachment on the area suggested, but after my experiance there&#x27;s just really no way that that&#x27;ll EVER be possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Micro Shaver - This is supposed to get right down to the skin when using this attachment, however again this attachment didn&#x27;t seem to do it&#x27;s job.  Even after applying extra pressure I didn&#x27;t see any less hair than I had before.  Again, this is another useless attachment (at least with my experiance).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Micro Trimmer - Essentially just a smaller version of the \\&quot;Precision Trimmer\\&quot;, this seemed to work okay, but again unless you&#x27;re carving your initials or doodling on yourself, seems like an unnecessary inclusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eyebrow Comb - Last but not least, the \\&quot;Eyebrow Comb\\&quot;.  This little sucker is actually pretty cool, it&#x27;s a little tiny attachment that lets you get right in close to certain areas.  Just like another \\&quot;As Seen On TV\\&quot; product (the \\&quot;Soft Touch\\&quot;) this little number get into those hard to reach places.  Kinda like a little minature weed wacker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also get an \\&quot;Ingrown Hair Eliminating Peeling Pad\\&quot;, as well as \\&quot;Lemon-Sage Body Butter\\&quot;.  I didn&#x27;t use either of those products as I have sensitive skin as is &amp; don&#x27;t use stuff like that unless I know something is tried &amp; tested.  The good news is I didn&#x27;t have any razor burn or ingrown hairs afterwards so for the most part the Bliss is a welcome new thingy-ma-bobber for the bathroom in my home.  I&#x27;m not at all unhappy with it, it&#x27;s just not the be all/end all of bush wackers.  Enjoy!applying an extra amount of pressure.  Granted, I didn&#x27;t use this attachment on the area suggested, but after my experiance there&#x27;s just really no way that that&#x27;ll EVER be possible.    Micro Shaver - This is supposed to get right down to the skin when using this attachment, however again this attachment didn&#x27;t seem to do it&#x27;s job.  Even after applying extra pressure I didn&#x27;t see any less hair than I had before.  Again, this is another useless attachment (at least with my experiance).      Micro Trimmer - Essentially just a smaller version of the \\&quot;Precision Trimmer\\&quot;, this seemed to work okay, but again unless you&#x27;re carving your initials or doodling on yourself, seems like an unnecessary inclusion.    Eyebrow Comb - Last but not least, the \\&quot;Eyebrow Comb\\&quot;.  This little sucker is actually pretty cool, it&#x27;s a little tiny attachment that lets you get right in close to certain areas.  Just like another \\&quot;As Seen On TV\\&quot; product (the \\&quot;Soft Touch\\&quot;) this little number get into those hard to reach places.  Kinda like a little minature weed wacker.    You also get an \\&quot;Ingrown Hair Eliminating Peeling Pad\\&quot;, as well as \\&quot;Lemon-Sage Body Butter\\&quot;.  I didn&#x27;t use either of those products as I have sensitive skin as is &amp; don&#x27;t use stuff like that unless I know something is tried &amp; tested.  The good news is I didn&#x27;t have any razor burn or ingrown hairs afterwards so for the most part the Bliss is a welcome new thingy-ma-bobber for the bathroom in my home.

    <li> Philips&#x27; binki perfect grooming system is heaven on earth for those who like to keep themselves &#x60;groomed&#x27;.  It is a minature-electric razor with four different heads, and two hair length comb settings.  The heads include one microshaver (giving u a close shave much like an electric razor), two trimmers (one narrower than the other) and finally an epilating head (that&#x27;s right, it pulls the hair out, and the head looks like the torture contraption that it is).     The trimmers are wonderful.  Using them, with the hair length combs attached, you can trim your hair to be anywhere from millimeters to centimeters long.  All it takes is about 10 swipes (in various directions) to get trim all the hair in that area to one length.  You use it very much a like a trimmer used by a barber to buzz hair.  The narrower trimmer is also great for evening out the length of eyebrow hairs.  The utility of these trimmers is endless.    The epilating head hurts, as should it when you pull out hair.  Though it&#x27;s effective, I would recommend waxing over use of the epilating head.  Waxing removes all the hair at the same time, and is quicker.    The microshaver head is equally effective, and gives a great smooth finish.    Finally, the instructions are very informative for those who are using a product like this for the first time.    Girls, (and guys) I highly suggest you buy this, especially in lieu of the upcoming bathingsuit season.</li>
    <li> First, I have to say that I do not know anything about bikini trimmers and have never used one before, although I do use an electric \\&quot;trimmer.\\&quot;  Out of the box, the Bliss-Philips Grooming System looks great. I was a bit overwhelmed by all of the attachments and everything it came with, most of which I had no idea what to do with.  However,  although it comes with pretty much anything you could want, the only really useful thing for me is the epilator, and possibly the styler. It performs moderately well, and gets a lot of points for being able to use in the shower, although I do think the epilator is a bit painful and they could have spent more time on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also mention that I am male, and very doubtful that I am the target audience for this product, but it worked fine for me and better than the cheap 10-year old grooming system I previously was using, so I plan to continue with it, although it will remain well hidden in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> I mostly bought this for the small epilator. I can take the pain and I like that it&#x27;s small. It also happens to have some other little tools that alright (I don&#x27;t get the mini shaver, what a waste.) I would love this a lot more if it didn&#x27;t take 10 HOURS to charge fully, and then the charge lasts all of 45 minutes. My phone charges in about 2 hours. And you can&#x27;t use it at all when it&#x27;s charging. I&#x27;ll use this for little jobs, but I need something that won&#x27;t leave me hanging.</li>
    <li> I decided to buy this product because of the trimmer. Cutting pubic hair with scissors is always dangerous. The epilator head is small, which means pain during a longer period of time, but ingrown hair is less likely to occur. Overall, I am satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie. I&#x27;m generally a lazy girl when it comes to bikini maintenance. I&#x27;d rather pay someone or go the quick trim route with some eyebrow scissors than get down and dirty with wax or razors myself, but I couldn&#x27;t resist the offer to try a product like this. My first concern when I looked at the packaging for this product was that I&#x27;d lose all of my attachments. Like I said, I&#x27;m lazy. But after opening the kit I saw that there&#x27;s a handy-dandy little carrying bag in which to put all your components. Score one for Bliss Spas. The whole kit packs up pretty nice and compact, which is nice if you&#x27;re someone who travels a lot and wants to do some section maintenance on the go. This kit is also nice in that you don&#x27;t just have to use it for down there, it works perfectly well for doing brows and other hairy areas as well. The device itself is cordless and easy to use. No muss, no fuss, hair control in a compact (and cute) package. I&#x27;d recommend this one to a friend.</li>
    <li> Philips has come up with a nice all in one product. It has a precision trimmer head, a micro trimmer, a mini shaver and a mini epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I think that the only tool I will use the most is the precision trimmer head which is why the product gets 3 stars for price-value factor. It had a comb like attachment that fits over it and gives you 5 lengths of hair to choose from. However, its hard to actually trim the hair neatly to precisely the same length using the comb attachment. Although the shaver is very ergonomic in shape, it still does a job no better than my older battery  operated [[ASIN:B00005JS5C Panasonic ES246AC Bikini Shaper and Trimmer]]. I also prefer the convenience of batteries when traveling, as it is small and compact and does not need a charger. The smaller length of the Panasonic trimmer makes it easier for me to control while using it in the bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the micro trimmer for eyebrows to be only moderately useful as I have very light eyebrows and can use a mini-scissor with more precision. I couldn&#x27;t find the comb attachment for this trimmer in my box and ended up taking off more eyebrow than I wanted to, so read the instructions more carefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the epilator, it&#x27;s the older design of epilator that has rotating metal discs that pinch or tweeze out individual hairs by the roots. It&#x27;s too painful for facial or bikini hair and too tiny to use on your legs and arms as you&#x27;ll take forever with a lot more pain. My [[ASIN:B000EZYKTS Braun 5270 Silk-&amp;eacute;pil X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator]] has a different design and is far less painful than this epilator. This one is good for use on a few stray hairs here and there. Again if you&#x27;re removing facial hair, tweezers will do the job more precisely for 1-2 hairs and facial waxing strips like are far more efficient and painless for any other facial hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver head did not get all the hair but is ok if you need to get into \\&quot;tighter\\&quot; spots. I don&#x27;t expect to use this attachment too much, when I need a closer shave the precision trimmer without the comb attachment works better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the Bliss Philips Bikini System has many attachments but if you are basically looking for only a bikini trimmer you may want to spend less and go with [[ASIN:B00005JS5C Panasonic ES246AC Bikini Shaper and Trimmer]] or [[ASIN:B0000BY85E Remington BKT-1000 Trim &amp; Shape Bikini Trimmer]].ment too much, when I need a closer shave the precision trimmer without the comb attachment works better for me.    Overall, the Bliss Philips Bikini System has many attachments but if you are basically looking for only a bikini trimmer you may want to spend less and go with [[ASIN:B00005JS5C Panasonic ES246AC Bikini Shaper and Trimmer]] or [[ASIN:B0000BY85E Remington BKT-1000 Trim &amp; Shape Bikini Trimmer]].</li>
    <li> -------Note: This review was done by my WIFE ---------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, too, like the other review was apprehensive on using this at home grooming system.  However, I was most intrigued by it, and could not pass it up!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off I have to admit that I was a bit overwhelmed when it first arrived.  There were so many attachments I was unclear on what was what.  So before starting I spent one evening just reading the \\&quot;easy to ready\\&quot; directions pamphlet.  I am new to the whole grooming process so I wanted to make sure that I was doing the right thing in the right places.  Like it says there are 5 attachments.  They are: the Precision Trimmer  (Ensures even grooming results. Adjusts to five length settings), the Precision Comb  (Grooms bikini line with precision and comfort), the Epilator (Removes hair by the root for smooth skin), the&lt;br /&gt;Micro Shaver  (Extra smooth and safe with hypo-allergenic foil), the&lt;br /&gt;Micro Trimmer (Shapes and defines eyebrows or removes a single hair), and the Eyebrow Comb (Trims entire eyebrow to a uniform length).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will however use most the Precision Trimmer and the Micro Shaver.  I find the Precision Trimmer to be one of the better attachments because it puts the worry that you are not going to get a uniform cut.  The comb has 5 settings and you just  brush in the opposite way that your hair grows.  I tried this on my arm to see if I would get the same length on all hairs, and I did.  The only draw back I would say is that the 5 settings are not \\&quot;locked\\&quot;.  It is easy too accidentally press hard and have it switch to a different length, mid- shave (that is the reason why I did not give it the full 5 stars).  The Micro Shaver is perfect for hard to reach spots with a traditional razor.  Perfect for any small spot that is hard to get to, or you forgot when in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that you can use this razor in or out of the shower.  Good for some last minute grooming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the bikini area goes, I am an old-fashion girl and I liked how I could maintain a clean and natural look while still feeling groomed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to my friends.how I could maintain a clean and natural look while still feeling groomed.      I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife and this is what she had to say about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty impressed with this product.  Now, granted, before using this I had only used regular hair trimming kits and very inexpensive hair trimmers, but I think that this kit is worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several attachments, so the product is pretty versatile.  It works great for removing hair all over the body.  I have mainly used mine for areas on my face and neck that I have hair that I don&#x27;t really like there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite attachment by far is the Micro Trimmer.  It leaves your skin feeling extremely smooth.  It works great for removing hair on the face and I especially like using it for hair above the upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Eyebrow Comb worked very well and has adjustable length settings.  It was a quick, easy way to trim up my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little worried about trying the Epilator, but I tried it and it wasn&#x27;t too bad.  I thought that it was rather uncomfortable, but that is what I was expecting since it was pulling the hairs out from their roots.  I didn&#x27;t have any problems with skin irritations or ingrown hairs, so that was good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is hard to know how long to charge the trimmer because the light on the charger always stays green.  But, it does seem to hold a charge reasonably well, so I don&#x27;t have much to complain about in this area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a pretty good product and I hope that the variety of attachments prove to be useful for some time to come.</li>
    <li> Basically we all know that the professional treatment is always the best way to go when it comes to hair removal, the only down side is how insanely expensive it is and how intrusive it can be. This little gadget from Bliss is pretty good! I was very excited to receive my box and examined it all right away. It even comes with a little tube of their bestselling body butter ( pretty good but not worth the price in full size imo)  and one packet of wipes that prevent ingrown hairs when used after depilating. Also I found the little blue pouch that is used to hold everything once you throw the box away to be cute and handy in preventing it all from scattering all over the bathroom.    I find that the attachments work similarly, you can really use them any way you please, there isn&#x27;t really a wrong tool in here for anything, other than when it comes to fixing eye brows all the tips can be interchanged on any part of the body. I first tested the ends on my arm to have a better idea of how they work, overall they remove the hair fairly well and since most trim it at the top versus shaving and not including the epilator end, the ingrown hairs aren&#x27;t really a problem.    For this price it&#x27;s a good buy and one that I can see myself using often.</li>
    <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve owned quite a few battery operated trimmers. I have never found any to be anything more than mediocre. They do their job okay for a little while and then they wear out and have to be replaced. They usually come with one or two attachments if you&#x27;re lucky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver was a welcome surprise. Not only is it water resistant (you can&#x27;t completely submerge it in water, but it is shower-proof) which was a nice feature, but it&#x27;s rechargeable (no more realizing I&#x27;m out of AA&#x27;s right when I need to use it). It comes with a lot of really well thought out attachments. I love the trim guards to help make everything uniform easily. They really make using this trimmer quick and easy. I&#x27;m not brave enough for the epilator yet, lol, but I&#x27;ve used each of the other attachments and let&#x27;s just say my husband is impressed. ;) The spa products were nice but such small samples that they really shouldn&#x27;t be advertised as part of this kit, just a nice bonus. I haven&#x27;t seen this brand in any stores though, so the samples are kind of moot. The travel bag is nice and big, making it easy to find what you want without dumping the whole thing out and will be fabulous for tossing in my bag when we travel.</li>
    <li> First thing was opening the package which is very difficult, I had to use a pcket knife to open it since it had sealed edges all around. I do not like this packaging since I had to cut both sides to get lal the pieces out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is supposed to be for use in or out of the shower but in the directions it says not to use the trimmer if it has been dropped into water? So I was afraid to use it in the shower. For a Shower and bath you use water and especially a tub you would likely drop it in the water, so this doesn&#x27;t make sense to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The precision comb attachment did not work well for me, my hair is longer and it just would not cut it with that on so I removed the comb and just used the shaver itself.&lt;br /&gt; I do like all the attachments which give it multiple uses and I found they work good and get the hair like they are supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;I did not and will not use the epilator, I tried one of these years ago and it hurts way too much.&lt;br /&gt;It has a 2 year warranty which is good. I would much prefer if it could also be used with a cord for when the battery dies and will not charge any more. This would be for dry use only.</li>
    <li> Having plenty of dark coarse hair, I feel I have tried every hair removal method (bar laser) available.  Last Spring, I became a waxing addict - it was the best thing for me yet.  The only problem is the bothersome little stubble that comes up between waxings.  It&#x27;s not enough to wax and shaving it messes up the whole process.  I&#x27;ve had other \\&quot;groomers\\&quot; that were great for just that - trimming and \\&quot;neatening\\&quot; up a bit, but none of those provided a close shave.  I actually didn&#x27;t not hold out much hope on this one, but ordered it anyway thinking I had nothing to lose.  How very pleased I am that I made that choice.  I love it and unlike many of the reviewers, I&#x27;ve already used every attachment.  I love that the eyebrow groomer is separate from the bikini area groomer (unlike some past kits).  The main piece provides an unbelievably close shave and the mini shaver gets anything that might be left behind.  I can see how the depilator might hurt some, but being a waxer, it wasn&#x27;t really that different (somewhat mental really).  It stung a bit more in the tender, hard to reach spots, but the results were so worth it (and not being cut/nicked - all the better).  It&#x27;s also great on the legs.  This Bliss-Philips bikini perfect deluxe is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> I have not yet had the opportunity to explore the entire variety of features that this product includes. (No bikini trim for me yet.) However, I have used it a couple of times for my eyebrows and it works wonderfully. It doesn&#x27;t offer the precision that a small pair of scissors or tweezers would offer, but it more than makes up for it in convenience. (It also doesn&#x27;t hurt.) It appears to be a well designed product, well made, and so far it&#x27;s been reliable. No complaints here!</li>
    <li> The trimmer is everything that I have been looking for. The majority of my spa budget was going toward bikini waxes, which I was never 100% satisfied with and ended up having to do a lot of tweezing and trimming at home anyway. The trimmer has attachments for everything. I agree that it&#x27;s better suited as a trimmer than a shaver, but it gets close enough that a quick shave with a razor in the shower will do the trick for trips to the beach.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t review these types of personal products, but I received this in advance for the specific purpose of reviewing.  I&#x27;m so glad I did, though, because I love this product!  It&#x27;s a versatile system and can be used for legs, eyebrows and just about anywhere you would want to use this-- in addition to the bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is rechargeable and runs for quite a while before needing recharging.  The ONLY drawback I&#x27;ve found with this is that as soon as it&#x27;s plugged in, the light is green.  And, when it is done charging, the light is still green.  You cannot tell if it&#x27;s fully charged or not, and the directions state to charge it fully. However, even though this isn&#x27;t ideal, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a huge drawback, since it probably only takes a few hours at most to fully charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, to the product itself! This comes with several different attachments.  One is a full-size shaver. You can use this alone or add the comb attachment over this.  If you use the comb attachment over this, you have five length adjustment choices.  There is also a micro shaver which you can also use alone or add a comb attachment. This comb attachment has 3 length adjustments.  There is a micro trimmer for very difficult spots.  And, there is an epilator attachment which pulls the hair out from the root.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past, these types of epilators were painful, because they grabbed several hairs at a time.  This one isn&#x27;t too bad, though, as long as you hold your skin taught.  To be sure, I didn&#x27;t use this one in an area that I thought might be painful, though-- I was too much of a p_____(excuse the pun). Still, I tried this on my lower legs.  I had just shaved a day or two prior, so the hair was too short to catch with each pass-- but when the hairs did catch, it pulled them right out without any discomfort at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shavers and combs worked fantastically.  Very quick and easy.  You are really done in no time at all-- within just a few minutes, you&#x27;re as bare as you choose!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ready to try everything, I used the eyebrow comb and trimmed my brows to a uniform length. Very fast. It was so fun, in fact, that I was sorry that I had no more hair to do-- I thought of enlisting my husband and use the Bliss-Philips Bikini Perfect Deluxe Spa At Home Grooming System on him, but I decided talking him into it wouldn&#x27;t be worth the effort. Plus, I like his hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I do think this is a five-star product.  Mine came fully charged, with a small drawstring bag, and with some sample products.Ready to try everything, I used the eyebrow comb and trimmed my brows to a uniform length. Very fast.

    <li> Excellent grooming system.  I really like that it comes with so many attachments and a bag to keep them in.  The unit is really small and easy to use.  I highly recommend this product.  The epilator is painful, but effective.  Perfect gift for any woman. The quality of this item is exceptional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - 5 years later, and I am still using this grooming system.  It works best for bikini lines and under arms.  I have other groomers, but for those areas I always use this one.  Still loving it!</li>
    <li> To get right to the point a major plus of this product is it has several different attachments and different grooming tasks that it can perform. Other products on the market often do just one thing, such as a hair trimmer with just one hair length (this one lets you choose from five lengths or to have complete hair removal). This has an epillator that just removes all the hair by the root as just one feature versus other products on the market that are just epillators. So the tool is versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other best thing is the price. The price is low compared to other products on the market. I recall buying an epillator that was the hot product back in the early 1990s which was the most painful thing in the world. Once I tried it on my legs (just to be clear), I realized it was not for me and all my money was wasted, and it could not be returned either. The great thing about this tool is the low price and the many different options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the instructions a bit hard to figure out. Perhaps the fact that they fold out like a road map--is not the easiest thing to hold and read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I advise to read the directions carefully. Double check that you have everything snapped into place correctly, then go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However once I used it and understood what it was saying, it was very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not use every feature on this as I don&#x27;t have an interest in all that this does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of note on the hair trimmer, it is very easy for an inexperienced person to use and you can&#x27;t injure yourself. The contoured plastic guard prevents the blades from coming into direct contact with your skin. I&#x27;m comparing this with the professional grade hair trimmer used by barbers that my husband bought and has me use to trim up his hair--that other product is dangerous if used incorrectly and can and has shed blood. To underscore, this Bliss product is very easy for a beginner and is not dangerous for laypeople to use, like other brand products on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This can be used by men and women. Perhaps the men will have different uses for it, like trimming the eyebrows?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that this is cordless makes it very easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a cheap price for a versatile tool.

    <li> First off, I cannot prevent myself from a small complaint about the packaging.  It took me ages to get to the product encased in that super thick plastic stuff.  ARGH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the product itself, it is okay.  Let me admit that I am one of those women who usually visits a waxing salon.  When I saw this product I thought, yeah, I can save some money and still get the desired bikini line.  Not so much.  I will review by attachment:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Precision Trimmer : suppose to perfectly groom the bikini line - this did not work wonders for me and proved pretty useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Micro Shaver: extra smooth and safe - worked pretty much like my razor does except not as convenient as you cannot store it in the shower like a regular razor.  I did get minor nicks on occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Precision Comb: ensures even grooming - I was afraid the casing would fall off if I applied any pressure so my results were skewed.  I would much rather trim down the length old school then use an electrical mechanism no matter how safe looking.  I&#x27;m sure most of the girls are with me on this...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Micro Trimmer: shapes and defines eyebrows - this tool is useful for stray hairs away from shaped brows but can be tricky to use when hair is too close to desired brow line.  It can easily pluck eyebrow hairs you wanted to keep!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epilator: removes hair by the root - this attachment provided the best results for me but the pain level was not good!  I had to keep going over the area to provide a clean look.  Ouch.  At least waxing has a one time pain factor and not a continuous one as you keep removing one hair at a time.  On the other hand, paying for this system once beats paying (and tipping) for every salon visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eyebrow Comb: trims eyebrow to uniform length - I had no reservations about using this grooming tool but I really have no use for it.  One of my uncles on the other hand...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I need more practice to get the full benefits of this system.  I did love the samples included.  I am definitely buying the \\&quot;bliss ingrown hair eliminating peeling pads.\\&quot;  It&#x27;s my new favorite product!  And the body butter was nice too.  Including samples was a great way of introducing other lines by bliss.ly buying the \\&quot;bliss ingrown hair eliminating peeling pads.\\&quot;  It&#x27;s my new favorite product!

    <li> I like the design of this trimmer. It has a narrow curved neck so you can see what you are doing. I also liked the epilator head. The biggest problem is that the battery doesn&#x27;t last. The instructions said &amp;#34;up to 60 minutes of run time on a 10 hour charge&amp;#34;.  They should have put more emphasis on &amp;#34;up to&amp;#34; because you will be lucky to get a good ten minutes of run time from a full charge. After that it will slow down so much that just touching it to your skin will stop the blade. I followed the instructions to run the battery down completely between charges, but it still won&#x27;t hold a charge!  I wish they sold this design in a CORDED model.</li>
    <li> I had other electric depilatory systems before that work great, but this one for some reason makes it less painful. The other one I had I could only use on my legs, cause was what I could handle in terms of pain. With this one I do my bikini lines, arm pits and even over my lips! It&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with the grooming system which is really cool for a perfect bikini look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing is that the part that actually removes the hair is smaller than on most part of epilator, and that makes it to take a long time to finish big areas like the whole legs. But it&#x27;s totally worth it since this size helps on the bikini line.</li>
    <li> I bought this a couple months ago and have used all the attachments at least once.  Overall I am very pleased with it.  I may have even given it five stars if it wasn&#x27;t for the BATTERY!  You have to charge it for 10 hours to get 35 minutes of use out of it.  That is a bit ridiculous to me.      The instructions are a little long but if you read through them once you probably won&#x27;t have to look at them again. The attachments do what they are supposed to.  There were only a couple problems I have found:    The micro shaver doesn&#x27;t always get quite as close as I would like, but over all works very well.  The epilator is small.  It&#x27;d be nice to be able to use it on my legs but it would take a long time.  And it hurts, but anyone who has ever used an epilator knows it&#x27;s going to hurt at least a little.  The eyebrow attachments weren&#x27;t as great as I was hoping they would be.  I was hoping to be able to forever be rid of tweezing, but it&#x27;s not quite the case.  It&#x27;s hard to maneuver the long handle when you&#x27;re leaning close to a mirror to see what you&#x27;re doing.  I also found that it was sometimes difficult to get the micro trimmer to eliminate the hairs I was going after.  It&#x27;s possible I just need more practice.    Overall I am still happy that I bought this item and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe people are giving this thing more than one star! Ok, here&#x27;s the rundown. I read the directions, charged overnight (plus some), and hopped in the shower. I intended this, as it&#x27;s titled, for my bikini line and underarms. I was mostly concerned with removing length since my old trimmer died suddenly (tragic). The directions recommend using the trimmer without the attachment (which gives different lengths) before using the shaver. First, the trimmer did it&#x27;s thing, and even used regularly (lightly), it scratched me so I look like someone took their pointy fingernails to my lady parts. Not pleasant. Then the shaver attachment. Useless. I used this for many minutes on both trimmed and untrimmed parts to no avail. Hairs, untouched. My boyfriend even tried it on his stubble with zero results. It&#x27;s completely useless. Hence, worst I&#x27;ve ever used, and I have used products like this for 15 years. Plus, I can&#x27;t go anywhere in my bathing suit since I have horrid scratches all over my not-really-shaven bikini line!</li>
    <li> Awesome trimmer still have mine after many years.</li>
    <li> I am pregnant enough that I can&#x27;t see my bikini line.  Having reservations about using sharp objects where I could no longer see without a mirror, I decided to buy this product.  I used the micro shaver on my bikini line. I am much more comfortable with this, although I still have to use a mirror.  One added benefit, there is no more razor burn.  Since it worked on my bikini line, I tried it on my underarms.  No more razor burn there, either!  The down side, the shave isn&#x27;t quite as close, but hopefully no one besides my husband and my OB is looking that close.  As a side note, the instructions say not to use the epilator if you have psoriasis.  I had no plans to use it, but I do have psoriasis, so I have cemented in that decision.</li>
    <li> This razor is very compact making it easy to use in delicate places. It seems to be well made and the attachments are easy to exchange when needed. The epilator is great! I already own a larger epilator that I use on my legs but it is not at all suited for the more precise needs of the bikini line. This product was just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> This product is convenient to use and has come in handy for those last minute touch ups. It handles many grooming tasks, not just bikini areas. The only negative is that it will not run when it is plugged in, so keep it charged up.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions exactly - charged it fully for days before the first use, then let the battery drain before charging again.  Well, it won&#x27;t charge again.  The light on the AC adapter won&#x27;t even come on.  I tried every outlet in my 1700-sq foot house, nothing.  It will never turn on again.  I definitely want my money back.  Even when the battery was \\&quot;charged,\\&quot; it only lasted for a couple of uses.  What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> The Bliss-Philips Bikini Perfect Deluxe Spa-at-Home Grooming System comes with six attachments: 1) a precision trimmer that perfectly grooms the bikini line with precision and comfort; 2) a mircroshaver with hypo-allergenic foil for an extra smooth and safe shave; 3) a precision comb that adjusts to five length settings for even grooming results; 4) a microtrimmer that shapes and defines eyebrows or removes just a single hair if wanted; 5) an epilator which removes hair by the root for smooth skin for weeks; and 6) an eyebrow comb that helps trim the entire eyebrow to a uniform length. Also included is a bag to carry everything in, a brush to help clean the trimmer and attachments, one Bliss ingrown hair eliminating pad, and a small tube of Bliss lemon and sage body butter. There is also a charger included - the trimmer takes ten hours to charge and works for 35 minutes when fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a bit of a problem trying to open the box the trimmer was in, as well as getting the trimmer and its attachments out of the plastic container. This was a shame since I wanted to keep the trimmer in the box at least until I was sure of which attachment was which. I also had some problems with the instructions, as they were awkward to fold and unfold. Other than that, I had no problems with the razor.  It was very easy to charge. It was also very easy to add and remove the attachments and to clean after using it (although make sure you read the directions carefully on how to clean each part).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for shaving- the trimmer gave a nice smooth shave. The precision comb came in very handy, although I did have a hard time figuring out how the combs work. The precision comb for the biking line has five settings and the eyebrow comb has three settings and it took me awhile to learn how to adjust the combs to each length. Each comb is numbered, but it can be difficult to read the numbers. While the trimmer is easy to use and shaves nicely, you need to be careful when using it, especially when shaping. I found shaping my eyebrows to be especially unnerving as the trimmer removes every hair it touches and I was afraid I&#x27;d be eyebrowless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bliss-Philips Bikini Perfect Deluxe Spa-at-Home Grooming System does a good job when you can&#x27;t make it to the spa.ecially when shaping.

    <li> Loved how close this shaves!  Finally able to have great eyebrows without a price tag!  Women who shave anything would love this</li>
    <li> I bought this set when it was on Lightning Deal for $27.  I&#x27;m rather glad I bought it then, because I don&#x27;t think I use it often enough to warrant spending $50 on it (regular Amazon price).  Please note that this version is slightly different from the Sephora $60 version (that one have another trial size tube of something (scrub?) as well as 3 more sample pads of the ingrown hair pad).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging, honestly, was horrible.  Or was it just me not knowing how to open it?  I put a gash through my hand because I was trying so hard to cut open the plastic.  .___.  I&#x27;m starting to think that it&#x27;s mainly me not knowing how to open things, but at least they should include some kind of instruction on the packaging for the stupid people?  x___x  My ouch factor definitely came from that!  &gt;.&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I&#x27;ve honestly only used the Epilator so far (been too lazy/tired to do all the stuff i wanted to try with this).  Charging took 10 hours, but it holds charge relatively well.  Granted again i&#x27;ve only used the epilator, and I guess in the three times i&#x27;ve used it (without having to recharge) I&#x27;ve only used it for maybe 5-10 min at a time.  Still, I suppose not too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the Epilator, I&#x27;ve never used any other Epilator before so this is my first time.  I didn&#x27;t find it particularly painful.  I used it after a hot shower, maybe that helped?  I also might have a slightly higher pain tolerance (with a bit of masochistic tendency maybe? lol) so it wasn&#x27;t incredibly painful.  I would suggest having a dried underarm (rather than damp from after shower) otherwise it&#x27;ll be harder to move the epilator and therefore possibly snag at your skin instead.  It worked relatively well, but I do agree with many other reviews.  The Epilator head is rather small with just two tweezer on the rotating head, so really it can&#x27;t remove all that much.  Basically it missed a lot of hair.  on the other hand the hair that it did miss were rather difficult to see (thinner) so it dind&#x27;t feel awful (like I have stuff sticking into my skin).  However I do wish it would be able to clear the area better...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would think that if you&#x27;ve never used any of the tools listed above before (epilator, trimmer, whatever) then if this set gets a price drop again, it&#x27;d be worth the investment just to try them out.  It&#x27;s definitely difficult to get me to spend $50-100 just on an epilator (even if it&#x27;s a good one) when I don&#x27;t even know how it works, whether it works or not, whether it&#x27;s really painful or not, and if I would really end up using it a lot (get my money&#x27;s worth).  now I do know, so I&#x27;ll robably be investing in a better one later.  In the meantime, i&#x27;m going to take some time and start playing with the other heads.  :Dlike I have stuff sticking into my skin).

    <li> The machine works in every aspect in a very satisfactory way. I bought it for my wife and she found it very easy to use.  I read the irresponsible reviews that say that the micro shaver does not work. At first my wife also couldn&#x27;t use it and she thought that it was broken. Well, this is false. The thing is that hairs have to be really really short in order for the micro shaver to work. I tried it on my face and it cut even the smallest hair in a way similar to a good men&#x27;s shaver.  Please reviewers, be more careful when reviewing anything, people get influenced.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Depil and cut perfectly in all areas of body.</li>
    <li> The trimmer works when you need to trim hair in a small area. The epilator? Ouch! I tried it once, and that was more than enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seemed as though it would be useful, but after trying it I decided this was not a tool I needed to have.</li>
    <li> Much like sex, every generation thinks it has discovered body hair.  Hair removal has come a long way from the days when I used to sneak and shave my legs with my father&#x27;s single edge razor-- And how did he always know that I had been using it?  Maybe because it dulled the blade a bit-- huhm?  This was also about the time that sixties fashion designer  [[ASIN:B000UCTOSM Mary Quant]] -- created the mini skirt- was having her pubic hair groomed in the shape of a heart and discussing it in interviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But not even in our wildest dreams could we have imagined the sybaritic Bliss-Philips Bikini Perfect Deluxe.  Here&#x27;s the pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. You can use it in the shower without fear of electro-shock treatments.  Nothing beats being able to shave wet soapy skin.  And all of those little hair bits go down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The eyebrow trimmed is indeed easy to use, as is the eyebrow comb-- helps control those unruly brows without the fear that you will have to draw them back on when you are finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The Body Butter (they could have come up with a better name)is a super moisturizer which can render you a bit slippery if you are overly enthusiastic with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Clearly the manufacturers were not thinking of Baby Boomers when they created the numerical system for determing how close a shave is to be.  Those numbers are hard to read and I usually do not take my reading glasses into the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  The epilator attachment.  I remember the Lady-epilator-  Do Not Want--Ever-- to have my hair mechanically jerked out of very sensitive parts of my body.  If I wanted that type of pain I would go for a wax.  At least someone else does it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money?  Yes.  There&#x27;s some very good things about the system and its far safer than that single edged razor.</li>
    <li> I know what you&#x27;re thinking.  Why is a guy reviewing this product?  Well, to be honest, he&#x27;s not.  I gifted this product to a friend (and when I say friend, I don&#x27;t mean \\&quot;friend\\&quot; as in, you know, me.  I promise.)  Anyway, below is her take on the Grooming System, unedited and uncensored by me, the guy submitting the review...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I&#x27;m not sure why this product is touted as having \\&quot;super precision, less irritation.\\&quot; Because that is a big, fat misnomer.  \\&quot;Imprecision with irritation\\&quot; would be more accurate.  Overall, I was frustrated and displeased with this kit, although the body butter sample tube included was a nice treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, there are too many different parts that look alike, so I needed to have the paper instructions near me in the bathroom, even studying them earlier.  The trimmer is the one component that can be used in the shower.  However, for the sake of simplicity when one has to rotate the various attachments, I used the micro shaver, micro trimmer, and precision trimmer while I was dry.  Both the precision trimmer and the precision scratched my skin.  It wasn&#x27;t painful, but they reddened my skin and left white claw marks).  I hadn&#x27;t moisturized beforehand because the instructions state to make sure the skin is free of greasiness.  The trimmer has a so-called adjustable hair-length selector, but I found that switching among millimeters didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference.  It would&#x27;ve been much quicker to use my mini-scissors instead.  The electric razor didn&#x27;t remove much (my handy manual razor shaves much closer to the skin&#x27;s surface). I was afraid to use the epilator, and the eyebrow comb was missing from the kit, so I couldn&#x27;t try the groomer on my brows.  However, I think it&#x27;s a safe bet to say that if the groomer&#x27;s imprecise down there, the results on your face will probably be similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the overall \\&quot;spa\\&quot; look was not achieved at home.  I think this kit is a big mistake to purchase.  Seriously, it is so worth it to go to a salon and get a wax there instead -- it&#x27;s quicker, cleaner, and tremendously more precise.  I&#x27;ve done trimming, waxing, and manual shaving by myself in my bikini area before and the task went much more smoothly.  Plus, it feels rather uncomfortable knowing that a loudly buzzing, menacing electric razor is very close to your lady parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product *might* be handy to experienced self-groomers of the bikini area, but for a novice or someone who wants a professional-looking bikini line or design, I do not recommend this kit.  Total waste of your money and time. \\&quot;get a wax there instead -- it&#x27;s quicker, cleaner, and tremendously more precise.

    <li> I have to admit I was a bit skeptical about the effectiveness of this system, as the last electric shaver I had gave less than a close shave.  OK, so it was 35 years ago.      I have really sensitive skin and shaving the upper leg/bikini area always leaves me with razor burn.  I tried waxing at a few spas and I wound up with red bumps that lasted as long and looked as bad as the razor burn. I was afraid to hope this might be a solution.        The device comes with various razor heads and combs and can apparently also be used for eyebrows (would someone buy one for Donald Trump and Andy Rooney, please?).  Also included is a nice, cloth bag for storage or travel.      With the number of attachments and razor heads, good illustrations and instructions matching the quality of the product itself would provide a polished presentation.  Unfortunately, the instructions were printed on a huge piece of low grade paper that folded up somewhat similar to a map.  If that wasn&#x27;t bad enough, the pictures of the various parts were very small and labeled A-Z, which meant you had to check the list to see what A, B, C, etc. was.  You then had to access a different section of the instructions to see how to use each.      I think it would have been a lot easier to use the product for the first time had the instructions been better organized and if larger pictures had accompanied the text.  For an overall better presentation, a nice booklet on glossy paper would have been more consistent with the nice quality and appearance of the product.      That said, I wouldn&#x27;t let that prevent you from purchasing this well made product.  Just plan to spend a little bit of time getting through the instructions for your first use.  Once you get past that hurdle, I think you&#x27;ll be pleased with the results.      The precision trimmer did a fantastic job, leaving no razor burn and providing a close shave. The precision trimmer alone would be worth the purchase of this product.  The device is somewhat small and fits nicely in your hand, making it easy to use and is cute.        I can&#x27;t yet give a testimonial of the eyebrow trimmer, as I&#x27;ve had electrolysis on them - and I have to get my courage up for the epilator and don&#x27;t want to use it on any areas that will be visible during these summer months, as I tend toward extreme reactions.  I&#x27;ll update this when I&#x27;ve used either or both.      All in all, I think this is a very nice product that has good results and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> When I started looking for a product to tame the bikini area I was really torn between this one and the Braun 5270 Silk-épil X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator.  The Braun got slightly better reviews so I went for it.  HUGE MISTAKE.  First of all, it is awful for the bikini area.  I lost skin and hair.  Talk about pain!  That item was returned ASAP.  I personally bought this for the epilator feature.  I am tired of the cost of waxing and the nair stuff just doesn&#x27;t work all that well (for the record, I am a female and I like it ALL GONE).  So, the trimmer/shaver is ok.  Doesn&#x27;t work all that great in the shower.  The microtrimmer didn&#x27;t work at all for me.  The epiating feature is great though, much less pain than the braun.  Does it hurt - yes, I mean, let&#x27;s face it.  You are ripping hair out by the root.  If you have a low threshold for pain, then you need to start off slow.  If you are used to the pain of waxing - I don&#x27;t think  you will find it is much more than what you had gotten using that process.  The best tip I have is to do it after you bathe.  I make the mistake of not doing that and did have some minor discomfort (like a sunburn) for a day or so.</li>
    <li> This razor is great. I didnt want to spend a lot of money on waxing, or on a more expensive personal razor. Bliss, is just this, a good deal!</li>
