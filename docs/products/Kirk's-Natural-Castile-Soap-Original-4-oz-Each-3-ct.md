<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good for making my laundry detergent.</li>
    <li> Kirk&#x27;s Castile is an all-natural, pure soap made from simple ingredients. The additional bonus is just how great of a value it is at less than $2/bar (less if you get a 3-pack). I&#x27;ve used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s in the past but something in the formula does not agree with my skin. I gave Kirk&#x27;s a shot to help with the redness I would get on my chest and other areas of the body that seemingly every other soap caused me. I am accustomed to buying quality soaps that are all-natural but my skin is very sensitive and picky with ingredients. Kirk&#x27;s has performed the best so far of any I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of lather no matter how hard or soft your water is, feels creamy and smooth on the skin, and the bar seems to last a very long time. No animal testing or by-products - a pure vegetable soap (hence &amp;#34;castile&amp;#34;). I love the fragrance as well, which is of the pine and citrus family according to their website. It smells great in the shower but isn&#x27;t overpowering and it lingers shortly on your skin afterwards. I definitely feel very clean after washing with Kirk&#x27;s and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight and doesn&#x27;t show any redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some may be concerned with the pH of this soap and that it is not &amp;#34;pH-balanced&amp;#34; for skin - typically soaps that are pH-balanced have ingredients added to it to synthetically lower the pH and those ingredients can end up being more harsh to the skin. The thing that makes me really enjoy this soap is the simplicity of its formula and ingredients - it&#x27;s pretty much just saponified coconut oil and natural essential oils for fragrance - nothing else. This type of soap may not be for everyone, however, and those who have written negative reviews have very valid points. It&#x27;s definitely worth a shot to see if your skin agrees with it or not. My skin seems to approve so I&#x27;m sticking with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5</li>
    <li> Started using this in lots of things. Came quick. Happy with</li>
    <li> I rec this order very quickly, good product</li>
    <li> This is my favorite traditional soap and I&#x27;m glad I can get it here. I don&#x27;t really like any of the soaps with the chemicals, dyes, and fragrances added. I prefer a more traditional and natural soap and this fits the bill.</li>
    <li> This soap is so gentle and the suds are great too!</li>
    <li> I have been using Castile for a long time now and it is my preferred soap.  I will be ordering more when needed.</li>
    <li> I first used this soap when I went camping in Florida over forty years ago, and was amazed at how it lathered even in salt water. I still buy it, and use it because it still gets the job done. It&#x27;s simple, clean, and effective.</li>
    <li> I use this soap for my body wash AND my shampoo!  Yep you read that right.  Shampoo. It lathers great and only a little is all I need  I contemplated getting the Kirk&#x27;s shampoo because of this bar. However, after reading the ingredients I opted not to. This soap on the other hand is hypoallergenic. Biodegradable. No Synthetic Detergents. Free Of Synthetic detergents, animal by-products and it leaves my hair squeaky clean (yes, it actually squeaks) and my skin feeling superb. And I don&#x27;t have a shower full of bottles.  By the way guys and gals, works GREAT for shaving!!!!!  Also if you feel extra pioneerish (not a word, until now), you can grate some on a cheese grater and use it for laundry soap.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product that I use a lot of, but I found it much cheaper on Vitacost for $3.02 for the three pack.</li>
    <li> I did not receive this product. I was notified by the company that it was returned to them. They did not try to resend it. No reason was given for the return of the order by the USPS. At least the company let me know I would never get it.   I love castile soap but will have to find another provider who is reliable.</li>
    <li> Just what it said it was</li>
    <li> I like this soap a lot. It is not harsh &amp; everyone I know (who has tried it) asks me what it is and where they can get it. :) I gave a few bars away so far. It is also the best soap (since it is oil based) for cleaning paint brushes used with oil paint. :) Love it! Only downside I noticed - is that if used to clean/wash your face it really doesn&#x27;t get all that makeup off (not that I wear a lot). But as a body soap and hand soap - it is a wonderful natural soap.</li>
    <li> I love Kirk&#x27;s Castile soap.  I make my own petroleum-free laundry detergent using it and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.  A light, lovely, clean smell and effective cleaning power.</li>
    <li> Nice, creamy lather. This one smells exactly like Ivory brand soap to me.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know much about this soap before buying but assumed it would have a coconut oil smell but it does not. Not a deal breaker through. Will repurchase and will try the other types they have.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, in addition to a condition known as keratosis pilaris, commonly called chicken skin.  An uncurable condition that causes unsightly small red bumps on the arms, torso, and legs.  Most cleansers and skin care products only aggravate this condition.  Over the years, I have tried nearly every skin cleanser on the market in an attempt to find one that calms it, only to be disappointed time after time.  Then I found Kirk&#x27;s Castile soap.  After only a few months, my keratosis has been significantly reduced, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  This soap is mild, lightly scented, and lathers into an almost creamy density.  It&#x27;s also the best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;m prone to acne breakouts.  It is perfect for those with or without skin conditions.  Simply put, it&#x27;s the best soap out there.  Period.  Wish I would have found it years ago.</li>
    <li> I liked it and it smells good</li>
    <li> This is the best bar of soap both me and my husband have used! It lathers quickly, cleans well without that super tight dryness you get from other bar soaps. It also does not clog pores. It had no scent added but has a natural light scent. It is Hydrating and doesn&#x27;t clog pores- it&#x27;s great! In fact my husband reminds ME when it&#x27;s time to reorder !</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not much to say because this soap is not hard to fin. I had a very positive experience and received my shipment in good time and in good shape without any problems</li>
    <li> I love the way this soap makes my skin feel.  It has a great lather and it leaves the skin feeling soft and smooth!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as my only body/hair soap for a while now and it&#x27;s really great! It tends to dry out skin, so may not be good for all people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviews talk about it melting very quickly - it does. But I have remedied this by using a soap container that I take with me in and out of the restroom. I dry off the bar a little bit when I am done showering and stow it in the soap box until next time. The first two bars of the packet lasted about a week each, and the last one lasted for perhaps two months with this method. Wanted to post a review so people would know!!</li>
    <li> Using this to start being a little more eco-friendly.  It is what it is...SOAP.  Great stuff. Great deal.  I cut it up and watered it down to use for dish soap.  This should last me until about 2020.</li>
    <li> Smel very good. exelent soap</li>
    <li> Castile Soap is meant to be used as a \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; hypo-allergenic solution for cleaning sensitive areas of the body for single use.  It is not meant to be used daily as your shower soap.  Look up the MSDS for Castile soap.  It is available by a company called PDI.  You will be surprised at the extreme side-effects it can have, when used in a traditional household for a long period of time.  For example: De-fattening of the skin (while we all would like to lose weight) - Does not sound like a good effect of soap.  It can cause severe reactions, drying, cracking, bleeding, etc... Be careful, natural isn&#x27;t always better.  That&#x27;s why we usually do not just go eating random unknown berries from bushes in the forest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****ADDED 7/12/11****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to H. Luckett&#x27;s response below - I am wrong on my review.  Apparently, my MSDS was for a specific brand of Castile Soap Towelettes only.  He found an MSDS that shows no obvious signs of \\&quot;extreme side effects.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I am not endorsing it as a safe or unsafe product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, any single person can react differently to the same exact product.  So just use your own judgment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did, however, want to point out my mistake in my original review and  thank Mr. Luckett for finding the proper MSDS for Kirk&#x27;s Original Castile Soap.</li>
    <li> I make my own laundry detergent out of castile soap. I found that this soap didn&#x27;t get my clothes very clean at all. It didn&#x27;t dissolve as well as other castile soaps and left behind odors and dirt in the laundry. I also found the scent to be strong and unpleasant.</li>
    <li> Nothing fancy. Just a good soap.</li>
    <li> its soap that we use all the time. just ordered it online this time. but it was actually more expensive than in the store</li>
    <li> I love this soap! Natural and non toxic, mild scent and lathers beautifully. I use it for hand and body soap, face soap and for shaving- and I have sensitive skin. My favorite soap.</li>
    <li> Stop shopping around. Once you have used Kirk&#x27;s you will not need another soap. We take it everywhere. Use it to wash the body and your hair. You will feel squeaky clean - your hair too. We started using Kirk&#x27;s for our son&#x27;s summer camp back pack. He, too, uses it faithfully. As a pharmacy employee, when clients could not afford the expensive dermatologist&#x27;s prescriptions for acne and such, I would recommend Kirk&#x27;s. My encounters with these same clients later proved how great Kirk&#x27;s is. Inexpensive, effective, leaves the face nice and tight. You will look years younger. Excellent product. The stores in town cannot keep it on the shelves. I alone tell everyone to buy Kirk&#x27;s and where to find it.</li>
    <li> I love this natural soap and it lathers so nicely. Better than gel even.</li>
    <li> I went on their site and this is mostly natural - not 100%, as they say most of the ingredients are almost all natural.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, I have dry skin and this leaves my skin VERY dry and white... like the cheap Palmolive brand.&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly, this lasts about 4* days, and I used it twice a day. When I was using Dove, it lasted me about 7 days. I don&#x27;t waste soap in the shower so yes, it doesn&#x27;t last long in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kiss my Face is the converse to everything mentioned above, so I will be using the Kiss brand.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it, but that&#x27;s not to say you won&#x27;t. Let&#x27;s start by saying that I&#x27;m a woman, with dry skin, and prefer products without strong perfumes. Knowing this, my friend bought me this soap to use when I visit. Pros: Smells good (a light, pleasant unisex kind of scent) and it cleans the skin really well. Cons: It does has fragrance, it left my skin unusually dry, and like other reviews it did burn me (my lady parts specifically). This may be a good soap for some; maybe for people that are male with oiler, less sensitive skin. This may not be a good soap for others; it may not be for those people that avoid fragrance, have dry skin, and/or have lady parts.</li>
    <li> It is mild, not gimmicky, and smells like soap! I recommend it to anyone wanting an honest soap. I am out of words, sorry.</li>
    <li> Leaves soapy scum in shower.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. It lathers up very well- very thick and rich foam. It is gentle enough to use on my face. It has light, clean fragrance.</li>
    <li> Nice and clean, no residue and very effective.  I was looking for a tad bit of scent, but there really isn&#x27;t any.  It is good for the price and comes in a pack of three.  This is a good soap to have on hand and definitely is not oily or have an artificial feel/smell.</li>
    <li> We are trying the reduce our use of chemicals so tried this all natural soap.  It does lather well and doesn&#x27;t have an offensive odor but it leaves my skin very dry.  Not the one for me.</li>
    <li> Very basic but good quality soap, especially if you have hard water. Kirk&#x27;s has been around for a long time, so I guess they&#x27;re doing something right!!</li>
    <li> This is an old-fashioned HARD-WORKING soap. &amp;quot;Castile&amp;quot; traditionally means a hard white soap. It&#x27;s usually made with olive oil, but as the Kirk&#x27;s label states, this is &amp;quot;coco&amp;quot; castile, made with coconut oil. I always have it in my house because there is no soap around that will get out blood stains and ground dirt and even grass stains like Kirk&#x27;s Castile. I scrub Kirk&#x27;s on the cloth by hand with cold water and rinse with cold water. Repeat if needed. It has always worked for me if I haven&#x27;t already washed the fabric in a washer and dried it (which usually means the stain is set).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a hard soap, Kirk&#x27;s makes a good lather and rinses clean. It is not an emollient soap - so if you are looking for a soap that will ease dry skin, this is not it. The advantages of NOT being emollient is that a bar lasts longer, it cleans without excess oils getting in the way of the cleaning process, and, as I wrote, it rinses cleanly with no &amp;quot;soft&amp;quot; residue for babying the skin. But because it is not emollient, this is not a soap if you have dry skin. I&#x27;ve read some unfavorable reviews on this page, and I can understand their frustration. It says right on the wrapper, &amp;quot;Ultra Gentle with No Drying Residue&amp;quot;. The 2nd part is absolutely correct. The 1st part isn&#x27;t, in my opinion, but that&#x27;s why I LOVE Kirk&#x27;s Castile. A person may be sensitive to an ingredient in the soap, but maybe there is difference between &amp;quot; hypoallergenic&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;lotion-y&amp;quot; or similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We use it at the sink, but not in the shower/bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not be without this soap for about 30 years now. A new bar is 3 5/8&amp;quot; long, 2 3/8&amp;quot; wide and over 7/8&amp;quot; deep. This is a big bar for some soapholders, 4 oz (113 gm) a bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kirk&#x27;s is made in the U.S.A. Per the label: &amp;quot;Since 1839, Kirk&#x27;s master soap makers have formulated this hypoallergenic skin care bar with all natural coconut oil. Unlike other national brands, Kirk&#x27;s Original Coco Castile contains no animal by-products that can irritate sensitive skin. No synthetic detergents, like sodium lauryl sulfate, either.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To each his own when it comes to soap, but I am a long-time fan of Kirk&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Readers Original Coco Castile contains no animal by-products that can irritate sensitive skin. No synthetic detergents, like sodium lauryl sulfate, either.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To each his own when it comes to soap, but I am a long-time fan of Kirk&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Reader</li>
    <li> I agree that this makes me itch terrible in certain areas. I thought it would be good. Waste of money. Threw it in the trash.</li>
    <li> This soap did not dry my skin and has a great smell.  It really lathered well.  A great soap that my entire family enjoyed.  I will definitely buy more.  It doesn&#x27;t last as long as other soaps but leaves you feeling fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> I really like this soap.  I let it &amp;#34;dry out&amp;#34; in the closet for a few weeks, unwrapped, before using.  I&#x27;m not sure if this made a difference or not, but the soap did last a long time and didn&#x27;t just disappear as other soaps seem to.  No smell and work beautifully.  It is simple, which I like.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best soap I have ever used you can feel the difference the moment you lather I won&#x27;t use anything but this soap</li>
    <li> This soap is sooooo soft and full of suds. I bought it for making laundry detergent and have now converted my entire household over to using it for all purposes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy to have found this product online. I have been unable to locate it in my local grocery stores. It&#x27;s not full of chemicals, it feels good on my skin. I feel naturally clean.</li>
    <li> I had read about this soap somewhere and decided to give it a try.  I love this product!!!  It washes off and leaves your skin so clean and soft. No residue or oily feeling. Just a clean, clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I will never use anything else, and I have spent $$$ on bath soaps, etc.  Never again...</li>
    <li> Still the best value in Castile soap around.  I stock up and use the bars to make my own liquid castile soap at a fraction of the cost of buying even the gallon jugs of liquid, can make just as much as I want, the bars store easily.  I also use the bars in the shower, non-drying and non-irritating.  Even good for my hair!  No added ingredients like fragrances so I can use my own oils when I want scented castile soap.  Well packaged, promptly delivered, no fuss.</li>
    <li> This product s not Castile soap. Castile is made using olive oil not coconut.</li>
    <li> Ground it up in the food processer with the other ingredients, It comes out just like store bought powdered laundry soap, smells great and works as good as any.  Making laundry soap is easy on the pocket book and on the environment and So EASY!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a reason why this stuff is cheap. It&#x27;s not really natural or mild. It&#x27;s dishonest advertising. The first ingredient is simply labeled &amp;#34;coconut soap&amp;#34; but they don&#x27;t actually tell you what&#x27;s in this &amp;#34;coconut soap.&amp;#34; It could be anything. For all you know, &amp;#34;coconut soap&amp;#34; could mean &amp;#34;asbestos and coconut bark.&amp;#34;  Turns out that &amp;#34;coconut soap&amp;#34; is made from Sodium hydroxide. Funny how that doesn&#x27;t make it anywhere on the label. The last ingredient is labeled &amp;#34;natural fragrance.&amp;#34; Again you have to guess what is this company&#x27;s definition of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;fragrance.&amp;#34; Turns out it&#x27;s neither natural nor purely fragrant, but a concoction of artificial and synthetic chemicals.  Forget about honest marketing, this stuff is proudly (dis)labeled &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;no synthetics&amp;#34; ...Fine, that&#x27;s typical. Everyone knows the bottles which read &amp;#34;cranberry juice&amp;#34; aren&#x27;t actually made from cranberries, but at least they are a little honest in their ingredients list. If you cant even trust this company to be honest about the ingredients list (which almost no one actually reads in the first place) then how can you trust anything about them? Their labels claims it&#x27;s made of 5 ingredients, but then the fine print on their own web site will tell you that two of those intentionally vague ingredients (&amp;#34;coconut soap&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;natural fragrance&amp;#34;) actually contain other ingredients themselves. So how can I trust them they claim it contains &amp;#34;water&amp;#34; in the ingredients? How do I know that what they mean by &amp;#34;water&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t actually something else which you might be able to find if you search for some more fine print on their website? It&#x27;s Orwellian double-speak and marketing gimmicks.   edit: update: turns out that the &amp;#34;coconut&amp;#34; oil might actually palm oil. Don&#x27;t you just love the &#x27;and/or&#x27; game? &amp;#34;You might have a cold.. and/or AIDS. Deal with it.&amp;#34; Palm oil productionis horrible for the environment, by the way.   edit 2: Based on hard water tests, for sure these have a bit of detergent or sudsing agent added. There is no way these lather up as much as they do in hard water without something else added.</li>
    <li> No other soap leaves me feeling as clean or invigorated as this classic brand! Smells and cleans like soap should w/out any fake perfume no sense!</li>
    <li> Best toilet soap on the market, great for shampoo</li>
    <li> The PRICE that I got it here at Amazon was double than what I found it at Wal-Mart for, sometimes it&#x27;s cheaper at vitacost, too, over walmart. However, Kirk&#x27;s castile bar soap is a great product.  I am very happy to permanently add this product to my regular shopping list, since I have changed to natural/organic products in my home.  It lathers very very well, it used to dry out my sensitive hands and leave a white residue behind on my hands- reason for 4 stars. It takes awhile but after using it for many months, that just doesn&#x27;t happen much anymore, only a little dry. In the winter, the soap can dry my hands out more often, but I just use coconut oil &amp; I&#x27;m good to go. I&#x27;ve tried using it in my hair several times after I lather it up on a washcloth and it does great, but after showering, when I brush my hair, it leaves what looks like white powder in my brush. Baking soda water is better for the hair. (and vinegar water for conditioner)</li>
    <li> Like the versatility of it; you can use it as a body/facial/hand soap, detergent. It has no fragrance looks organic/healthy and it cleans very well (it can strip every oil off, so it can be a bit drying after use.) However, the price is kind of expensive IMO, $2.56 for a bar and it only lasts about 3 weeks in shower (used only by my boyfriend.) Will search for a cheaper price.</li>
    <li> good soap. will continue to buy this as long as it&#x27;s available. no perfume smell, just a soap that works.</li>
    <li> This soap is small enough to go in a back pack.&lt;br /&gt;It smells good.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not breaking out in a rash from this soap either.</li>
    <li> What a shocking surprise here. I bought 10 different types of soap one day at Amazon &amp; included this one. HOLY COW!!!! This soap has a great, clean, fresh scent right out of the wrapper. DO NOT BUY THE UNSCENTED VERSION, THAT WAS A WASTE OF MONEY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND, this soap lathers better than any other soap I&#x27;ve ever tried. It does seem to shrink a little quick, but at such a great price, I just bought more!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I could not find this soap anywhere in my area, so I looked on amazon and there it was.  I used this soap many years ago as a young women, and was very pleased to find that it is still the same great product it was then. The gentle smell and lather works wonders on my skin, and I will continue to purchase it.  Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, dont know why cant find it in stores.  Especially if someone has sensitive skin.  It is good for cleansing the hair of build up too.&lt;br /&gt;or to perk up a perm, wash your hair with it.  Shampoo or soap, doesnt matter, it works great.  enjoy</li>
    <li> Good soap for multiple applications. Using it on the dog.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year now. I buy 4 bars under $5.00 at my local Family Dollar store. I bought this on a whim after trying tons of name brands &amp;/or pricey &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; soaps...all of which failed to work for me because they were too irritating, too expensive for practical use or left soap rings in the bathtub. This soap makes tons of lather &amp; rinses easily &amp; completely AND it leaves my skin feeling squeeky clean and soft. My skin is very dry but since I&#x27;ve been using Kirks and Ammonium lactate lotions like Lac-Hydrin its improved greatly. I also like the way it smells.  It has a clean light fragrance that isn&#x27;t overpowering.  I gave a bar to my boyfriend &amp; several other friends to try; most of them use it regularly now because they like it so much.  It is a soft soap so if left in water it&#x27;ll melt. That happened a time or two for me but rather than toss it I decided to use it as liquid soap to clean the sink etc.  Glad I did actually because now I keep a bar in the kitchen, laundry room and basement to clean anything that needs cleaning by hand with soap and water. ( You might want to check out the website at http://www.kirksnatural.com/ for other products, user comments &amp;  suggestions.)  I&#x27;m so glad I found this soap. It&#x27;s just a good simple soap that has been around since the 1839.  I highly recommend this soap to everyone for just about anything... It does what it says &amp; more. I can&#x27;t imagine using any other soap.</li>
    <li> This is good, plain soap without all the mystery ingredients. It lathers well, smells good (not flowery, so as a man I like it yet my wife likes it too) and is lasting well and not melting away quickly. I keep it on a little rack so it can dry which seems to help. Another nice thing is that it rinses off quick and clean and doesn&#x27;t leave that slimy feeling like the body washes. I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
    <li> Works okay for my handcrafted laundry soap.  I&#x27;ve since started making my own but if you don&#x27;t make soap then this is one of the better commercial &amp;#34;soaps&amp;#34; you can buy.</li>
    <li> I tried this several years ago and it is wonderful soap.  My dry skin has cleared up and it is easy on the face and still gets the job done every where else.  I am allergic to Jergens and dial was too harsh for me.  So this stuff works for me, I love the smell, it washes great and rinses off perfectly.  Like any thing else - test it first and see if you like it.  For me it is great soap.</li>
    <li> Cleans well and the bar is sturdy and dissolves just fast enough for appropriate day to day use. These bars have helped my younger children wash up more independently as they no longer go through gallons of liquid soap a day.</li>
    <li> Love everything about this soap. I even use it for shaving and shampoo.</li>
    <li> Smells nice and lathers up well.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend and never heard any complaints from them about it. They were very specific about this type of soap too, so it must fit some pretty specific needs.</li>
    <li> Now I feel like a Catalonian Aristocrat. Clogs up the drain</li>
    <li> Use this to make my own soap to wash clothes.</li>
    <li> It is just the ting for showing--It works in either hard or soft water!  You will not regret buying this soap!.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap to use only on my beard and after 2 months, I&#x27;m still on my first bar. It lathers like no other soap I&#x27;ve ever used and the scent is almost non-existent, which is great for me. It does not dry out my skin and it rinses clean. One thing I would note is that I purchased this 3 pack through Amazon Prime and it sells for literally less than half the price at Walmart (if you can find it: 3 bars for $3.28). It sells for $3.99 at Albertson&#x27;s. It also sells for $4.99 on a drugstore website. All options far less than on Amazon. I prefer to shop at Amazon over having to go to stores, but for a lower price and ridding myself of the feeling that I&#x27;ve been totally ripped off, I&#x27;m willing to make the trip. I&#x27;ve also used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s  [[ASIN:B00180DS7I Rose Castile Liquid Soap - 32 oz.]] and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Original Castile Soap for the same purposes. Amazon sells the 32 oz. bottle for a great price, but the same bottle (Original/Peppermint) sells for $6 or $7 less at Trader Joe&#x27;s, if you are interested in checking it out. All things considered,I prefer Kirk&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Awesome soap...Great Lather...no residue...very sensitive on your skin!!</li>
    <li> This is a great all-around soap for the body as well as the household. If strong fragrances bother you and you want a soap that just gets things clean and doesn&#x27;t leave behind any residue or strong, perfume-y smell, this is it. I use this in place of shampoo. The moment I began using it, all my skin allergies stopped. I have not had a hint of dandruff in over 10 years. This also works great as laundry soap if you grate it into shavings, also you can rub it right onto a laundry stain.</li>
    <li> love this  product. it is a very pure soap so it fits in with my &amp;#34;less chemicals&amp;#34; philosophy. try it</li>
    <li> Love my homemade soaps and this is so easy to do.  This is the best pre treater and easy easy to use.</li>
    <li> my daughter mas extremely dry skin and has tried every product to help her hands . this soap  burned her skin not as good as we hoped.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use any other soap but this one. It&#x27;s cheap, lathers well, rinses well and does not leave me raw or irriated in sensitive areas like a lot of soaps do. I think its the coconut oil base that works for me.I highly recommend it if you are prone to allegic reactions.</li>
    <li> It burned a little at first but now it&#x27;s fine. My skin did require some adjusting to it.  It is a great soap though.  I use witch hazel afterwards and there is no dirt or residue left so I know it cleans the surface well. No irritation or break outs because of it and my face is very sensitive to additives. This is just plain old soap. I would not say it deep cleans and it drying. The moisture doesn&#x27;t return on my face after using it like it does elsewhere but that my issue and not the soaps. People with psoriasis might experience the same. Stupid peeling nose problem. Anyway, I&#x27;m happy with it and I like how plain it is. Other Castille soaps cause break outs on my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad its a natural product without additives, but I wish it left my skin more moist.  I do plan on buying it again, because I can&#x27;t make my own soap.  This is a good and inexpensive alternative.</li>
    <li> This  soap is so  great . 1.  I love  how  you  can  work up a  lather so  easily  and  wash  your  whole  body just on one lather.  That  saves  soap.  2. This  soap  does  an  excellent  job  of  removing the  residue of  deodorant under  the armpits completely.  I never have to do a  second  soaping.  LOVE THAT!  3. Your skin  feels  clean  without  feeling  stripped of  moisture .  4. All natural  simple  ingredients LOVE THAT !  Just  don&#x27;t  use on  areas where the skin is  cut such  as  after  shaving or  if  your  brassiere  has rubbed under  your  puppies  because the  soap burns like  crazy.  5. Price: I  wish  it  were a little  cheaper  but  this is  one  great  soap.</li>
    <li> very good for dry skin</li>
    <li> This soap is great, it lathers well and actually makes me feel clean.  Doesn&#x27;t have all the smells and nonsense that other nice soaps have.  If you want to be clean and smell clean, buy this soap.  If you want to moisturize in the shower and smell like the supermarket spice section, buy something else.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!  I wanted a soap product that didn&#x27;t contain a lot of chemicals and yet left my skin soft this did the trick!  I also used in make laundry soap and it did a great job I am very pleased with this product and will buy it again</li>
    <li> This is the first &amp; LAST time we will use this soap!  My 2 year old son was crying &amp; scratching at his skin within a minute of use.  After rinsing it off &amp; using our regular soap (Dr Bronner&#x27;s) he was happy again! Also, we use coconut oil daily with no problems.</li>
    <li> We love this soap in our family!  It has a distinct but pleasant smell that isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
    <li> I make my own laundry detergent and this was one of the ingredients. It is a tried and true soap. I think that it is one of the best. Well tested over the years! I spent $40.00 dollars on ingredients, this being one of them, and my batch lasted me a whole year.</li>
    <li> Great soap.  The bars are large,and still have that great mild citrus-like scent which is so nice.  Get the bars instead of the pump bottle,which is not quite like the original, and therefore not as pleasant as the bars still are.  Great product.  Update:  this formerly great soap  has changed,to  a \\&quot;don&#x27;t bother to buy it. \\&quot;. It was gentle,now it is harsh.  Coconut oil?  If it&#x27;s used at all,it must be in fractional qualities.  And the scent,or should I say stink,in no way resembles the original,which was so pleasant. In short,the present product resembles the original in name only.  Not recommended for anyone.</li>
    <li> this is the best soap ever. i&#x27;ll never buy any other brand. just great, great great. it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, no stinky smell, lasts a long time, and is not expensive. and no chemicals, nothing toxic in it. i buy it at my local supermarket a bit cheaper than on amazon, but when they dont&#x27; have it, i buy it here. it&#x27;s a great product, i hope they never change it, ever.</li>
    <li> This is my first bar of Kirk&#x27;s Castile soap and I am super excited. Lots of lather and softening coconut oil and no harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> an excellent basic hand soap  I highly recommend it!!!!</li>
    <li> Used this stuff since I was a kid. Best soap out there.</li>
    <li> Last time , it had a light fragrance.  I have lost my sense of smell, most of the time, but I could smell the soap.  This time there is no  fragrance.  in fact our daughter bought us the soap last time and picked up locally someplace, but she can&#x27;t remember where.  Does Kirks have any fragrance?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Order was filled promptly and correctly.  I still love the soap, even though I don&#x27;t notice a fragrance.</li>
    <li> I love this soap for personal use and for making laundry detergent with.  The ingredients are nice, especially compared to others out there.  I make laundry detergent with it too and wow, it sure makes my laundry clean and fluffy.  It&#x27;s also one of the rare body soaps that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  As for the price,  it&#x27;s almost double on Amazon than it is in the supermarket, seven dollars vs four dollars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this soap before and used with no problems. However the last batch was very harsh. I bought a set of 3 in December and used it along with some other bars of soap, not realizing it was the culprit causing me to develop raised welts and a rash on my neck chest, arms and belly. (at first, I thought my problems were caused by our cedar Christmas tree, or a wool scarf, or some new lotion I was using) Anyway, I had itchy, raised bumps that turned into dry scaly patches. NOT fun. I stopped using the soap and all of the symptoms have gradually gone away.</li>
    <li> The best body soap that I have used. Helps heal your skin when others claim they do but perform poor. It was so good I purchased a case of it. Now I just have to refrain from giving allot of it away as gifts. It creates allot of lather and comes off clean in the shower. Wash my hair with it as well and even shave with it. Like it says, if you have sensitive skin don&#x27;t leave it on to long until you have a chance to get used to it.</li>
    <li> I gave it three stars because it reminds me of ivory soap or those samples you get in hotels and such. It really cleans and takes the oil off the skin so if try to slide your hands on your skin or body, your hands grip and stick to your skin. I don&#x27;t like that feeling and i&#x27;m more use to moisturizing soaps. Its winter and i find this soap is making my skin more itchy now and i had to switch to another soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you like ivory soap this is for you, if not, look for something else, i&#x27;ll be trying another brand of castile soap and see if that gives me better results.</li>
    <li> Kirk&#x27;s castile soap is the best soap you can use especially if you have hard water.  I have used it for over 60 years.  My first experience with Kirk&#x27;s goes back to my childhood and my father and uncle.  They were coal miners and this soap was the only kind we used back &amp;#34;in the hills&amp;#34; of Pennsylvania.  I like the clean, fresh smell and the lather.  I also use it for shampoo as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with ordering was great.  I received my product promptly and it was packaged nicely.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Great soap and at a good price!</li>
    <li> good soap overall  I wanted to try this soap and it is unavailable in stores around me.&lt;br /&gt;Glad I could get it online</li>
    <li> I have begun making my own laundry detergent (and saving a bundle doing it).  Kirk&#x27;s Castile soap is perfect, doesn&#x27;t suds a lot, so it works in my new high-energy washing machine.  It has a very clean smell, and the detergent is getting my clothes clean.  They have a very fresh, clean smell coming out of the washing machine - not perfumey like with regular detergent.  I will definitely continue buying Kirk&#x27;s for future home-made detergent.</li>
    <li> Perfect for slightly oily complexions.  Not too drying.  Less expensive than most facial soaps, but just as good.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Nice deal for good soap.</li>
    <li> This soap was recommended to me due to my eczema. I was told that it had no harsh chemicals, and my skin would love it. I&#x27;ve tried it twice now and it&#x27;s in the trash. It burns my skin especially the sensitive parts and leaves a film that makes my skin drier than ever. I think the company has changed its formulation; many recent reviews are quite low for this product.</li>
    <li> I like this soap;because it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
    <li> perfect, and simple, I made castile liquid soap from it, but it is great to have on hand at all times!</li>
    <li> It is what it says it is.  Plain old Castille soap.  Its a decent sized bar and arrived in appropriate packaging.</li>
    <li> I ike soap without complicated factory chemicals, deodorants, odoration, etc.  The bundle price is a little cheaper than the store.</li>
    <li> For general reference, I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Long-story short, just about the same stuff that other reviewers who had a bad experience with this soap. Although it lathers really well in hard water, it left a filmy, chalky residue on my skin that was noticeable immediately after using it. I continued to use it thinking that perhaps my skin was too accustomed to \\&quot;processed\\&quot; soaps and needed to get used to \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ingredients, but oh, no... Within a week of using it, my skin was incredibly dry and itchy: arms, legs, back, shoulders and my hands...dear lord, my hands looked like they had aged 10 years, they were so dry and wrinkly! Then again, probably the worst part was the stinging when I shaved my legs -- I always use soap for shaving and had never had this happen with any other soap I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice, if you still want to try this soap -- buy a single bar, not a pack or in bulk.</li>
    <li> and I&#x27;m old as dirt, we&#x27;re living in below-zero weather right now, and i recently discovered that Kirk&#x27;s Original Castile bar soap is the most wonderful soap on the face of the earth. I have tried EVERYTHING for my old, dry, sensitive skin but THIS IS THE RASPBERRIES.  I may or may not go back to Dial White in the hot summer months. Even my husband likes it and you don&#x27;t know how very strange that is.</li>
    <li> This soap is amazing!! It gives my skin such a clean feeling!! It has a very mild scent and lathers quickly so there is no need for overuse.</li>
    <li> Soap -- real soap smelling soap.  Makes you feel like you&#x27;re on a wagon train -- in a good way.  Nobody is dying of dysentery with this soap around!</li>
    <li> Great castile soap.  I made liquid soap with it.</li>
    <li> great price, great product!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I couldn&#x27;t find it at the grocery when I moved, and I was almost out. The Castile soap works well with hard water, and I like the way this brand smells even though it&#x27;s pretty mild. I have a sensitive nose so stronger scents bother me. I&#x27;ve heard that it helps with acne issues as well and while I can&#x27;t really say either way for sure, I know at least it doesn&#x27;t make things worse.</li>
    <li> I like this soap very much. I use it to make homemade laundry detergent.</li>
    <li> This is super cheap really great soap.  LOVE IT!  eleven more words are required so I am typing some more.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get what everybody thinks this is so good. It&#x27;s okay but nothing spectacular . No particular smell, didn&#x27;t leave</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  That is all.</li>
    <li> Was supposed to be a pack of 3 but only received one bar.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a long time Dr. Bronner&#x27;s bar soap user.  So long in fact, that&#x27;s I&#x27;ve grown tired of all the scents available (not to mention the steep price).  Thought I&#x27;d give Kirk&#x27;s castile soap a try, because I like the short list of ingredients and the price is right.  I love the smell of Kirk&#x27;s, a very clean &#x27;soapy&#x27; smell that I would never tire of.  The first time I used it, I vaguely sensed a slight burning sensation on the back of my sudsy shoulder (pre-rinse).  I rinsed off, forgot about it, and decided I found my new soap.  Next day, same sensation but on my chest.  This time however, the site became red and looked rather irritated even after I was dried and dressed.  I have to believe that glycerin is the culprit here.  I&#x27;ve read reviews from some long time users of this soap that noted that Kirk&#x27;s bumped up the glycerin content recently so that it surpassed what USED to be the second listed ingredient, coconut oil (which I have no problems with).  The old formulation may have been the ticket for me, but not this one.  Sad.  Guess I&#x27;ll stick with you for now, Doc Bronner! (can&#x27;t say enough good things about their products).</li>
    <li> I used OCT shower gel for years and switched to liquid castile soap less than a year ago and thought I should give soap bar a try. I&#x27;m glad I did after doing all my research (reading up the reviews). The scent is so not offensive (I&#x27;m pregnant and my sense of smell is like that of a hound). Without putting on any moisturizer after shower, my skin feels softer than before. Pretty comparable to when I was a teenager. Great product!</li>
    <li> I use this in the shower and for my hands but it&#x27;s not gentle in the way a baby shampoo might be.  One of my kids got some in a sensitive spot and it really stung so not a great bar to give your kid in the bath. I&#x27;ve had it give me a good eye sting before as well so it&#x27;s natural and cleans very well. It&#x27;s free of nasty commercial chemicals which is all great but you still need to be careful with it particularly around kids.</li>
    <li> I tried Kirk&#x27;s Coco Castile Soap a couple of years ago when my skin was going through a dry and sensitive period. I thought it would be more mild than the soap I was using at the time. Kirk&#x27;s caused all the skin it touched to feel like it was burning. I thought it was from the fragrance ingredients and after two painful uses I threw it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This winter I&#x27;ve been using organic virgin coconut oil to moisturize my skin. I noticed that my skin was getting progressively drier and itchier and after two weeks I developed a burning red rash on all the skin I&#x27;d been applying the coconut oil to. I finally realized I&#x27;m allergic to coconut oil! I thought I&#x27;d share this insight to help other people who have had similar reactions to Kirk&#x27;s Coco Castile Soap identify a potential allergen.</li>
    <li> I like it. great on skin.</li>
    <li> Kirk&#x27;s Castile Soaps, original or unscented, is a product with a number of applications:  It is excellent for use in \\&quot;hard water\\&quot; situations:  Camping, \\&quot;roughing it\\&quot;, making your own laundry detergent, locations with water containing very \\&quot;Hard\\&quot; water (lots of iron in water- look for obvious rust stains on porcelain fixtures).  I take this with me when camping in Mid- and Northern Michigan, as it is the only soap that I have found to lather in water with a heavy mineral load, be it Iron, calcium, etc. The unscented versions have been successfully used by several individuals of my acquaintance who possess numerous skin sensitivities and contact allergies, without the accompanying rash/ hives/redness/itching associated with artificial scenting agents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as a bit of a side note:  For those individuals interested in storing a pre-made soap for Emergency Preparedness purposes, *this* (in unscented form) is one of the contenders for inclusion in your supply reserve:  According to Kirks&#x27; website, there is an INDEFINITE shelf life to this product.  I have personally used slivers of Kirk&#x27;s Castile Soap that have been upwards of 15 years old, and have still gotten it to lather in hard water.  I would suggest that you unwrap and expose each bar to the air for several weeks, in order to \\&quot;harden\\&quot; the soap, and make it last longer when in use.  The lather will be lessened, but the bar will dissolve at a much slower rate than it would for \\&quot;uncured\\&quot; bars of this soap.</li>
    <li> Better than major brand stuff (that comes off gooey, smells like chemicals, gives you a sticky feeling). Kirk&#x27;s lathers well, smells of coco and herbs, and rinses really well. Very mild in scent - and the bars are big. I like the lather and feel of this better than Burt&#x27;s Bees (another good soap), but Burt&#x27;s has a better scent (citrus).</li>
    <li> No idea why, but lately the soaps I&#x27;ve been using have been really irritating to my skin. I had a bar of this lying around after not using it for a LONG time (it must&#x27;ve been in storage for 8 years) and figured what the heck I&#x27;ll see what happens. No irritation afterwards whatsoever after using it for a week. This stuff is awesome.  I just ordered up some more and intend to get a good stock of it going.</li>
    <li> A quality item at a good price.</li>
    <li> Love this soap, I use this daily.  This is a great deal compared to buying it in the store.</li>
    <li> Man-made fragrances and chemicals make my skin itch badly, especially in winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I discovered Kirk&#x27;s, I used Dove sensitive in the shower.  To me Kirk&#x27;s smells better, produces better lather, and most importantly makes me itch less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s in foaming dispensers for hand soap at all of my sinks, but a bar of Kirk&#x27;s is much easier to use in the shower than a foaming dispenser.</li>
    <li> I use this to make my own liquid soap comparable to Dr. Bonner&#x27;s. It works as well in beauty products as it does in cleaning products.</li>
    <li> I melt this and mix with borax and washing soda ( and some essential oil) for wonderful laundry soap.  Works great....and doesn&#x27;t have the petroleum that Fetsnap has in it....</li>
    <li> I used 1 bar for a homemade bath wash a month ago and we havent even used up a small bottle. 1 bar can make 1 gallon of body wash. It&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My back pimples went away and my skin is soft and clean.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Works great for making laundry soap.</li>
    <li> Best soap on the market.  If you like lather, this is it.  Wash iyour hands, Wash your hair, Wash you arms, Wash everywhere.  It leaves no film, It leaves no scum,  Take my word, This is the one.</li>
    <li> this great for my scars.</li>
    <li> Kirk&#x27;s Castile does not irritate my skin, nor does it leave scum on the water.  I would recommend Kirk&#x27;s Original Coco  Castile Soap for anyone with eczema or other annoying sensitive skin issues.</li>
    <li> This will work great with my homemade shampoo.</li>
    <li> I love my Kirk&#x27;s castile soap. I&#x27;ve bought a few packs of it now and it works great. I have incredibly sensitive skin and have had no issues with this product at all. I use this to make hand soap, laundry soap, dish soap. I&#x27;ve used it both to shave down to thicken soaps and also to melt to keep around as make shift &amp;#34;liquid castile soap&amp;#34;. I buy this soap because its soooooooooo much cheaper than Dr. Bronner&#x27;s. HOWEVER!!!!!! This is not the cheapest that you can buy it. I was surprised to find it in my local walmart for nearly half the cost! and yes it was a 3 pack of the 4oz bars. It is also available on walmart&#x27;s website and you can have it shipped to store for free and pick it up, or pay for shipping to deliver it to your house. Your choice. It was conveniently at my local store and I grabbed the last pack, so I assume it&#x27;s a popular product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, great soap, terrible price here on amazon. Buy it on walmart or demand they drop the price here!!!!</li>
    <li> great price for a great product</li>
    <li> I am using this soap&#x27;s solution to remove whitefly from outdoor plants. It is working very well - however I had to do multiple applications to completely remove the whitefly from my plants.</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  I have used it for my face, my body, and once even on my hair. I was on a rustic camping trip and forgot shampoo.  I really needed to wash my hair, so I figured it may make it feel gross but at least it would be clean.  To my shock, it lathered wonderfully and my hair felt great after it dried!  I was tempted to use it when I returned home but decided against it in case it would build up over time.  It has a pleasant smell, but not a perfume smell. Personally I like the smell of traditional liquid castile soap, but I know everyone doesn&#x27;t. This does not have that same smell, just sort of neutral actually. It feels smooth in my hands when I am lathering up (which it does lather very nicely on skin in addition to hair), and it leaves my skin feeling clean without being oily or dry. My kids are grown, so I can&#x27;t say if it would be good on the skin of babies or small children.  However with its natural ingredients, unless your child has very sensitive skin, I would think it would work nicely and you could use it from head to toe, making bathtime less hectic.  Maybe try it on a small spot first to see how they react.  I bought this first in a gift shop and couldn&#x27;t locate it elsewhere, so I was so happy when I saw it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I like it&#x27;s pure smell and I grate it into the rest of the mixture when I make my own laundry product. It makes great suds</li>
    <li> Great cleaning but gentle soap.</li>
    <li> I use this soap to make homemade laundry soap.  works great.</li>
    <li> I use this as one of the ingredients when making my homemade laundry detergent.  I initially tried Fels Naptha, but our clothes smelled dingy after a few washes.  I switched to Kirk&#x27;s Castile to see if that would make a difference.  If it didn&#x27;t, I was going to give up making homemade laundry detergent altogether since I had heard that others had a problem with their clothes smelling dingy using homemade laundry detergent.  Anyhow, I made the switch to Kirk&#x27;s and my clothes always come out smelling fresh and clean now, after months and months of laundering, not just a few washes.  It makes me wonder if that was the problem others were having with their homemade laundry detergent.</li>
    <li> I really like this soap.  I feel like I am using a soap that is good for my skin.  Doctors tell me to use an expensive anti bacterial soap. This soap is a little higher than your grocery store soap.  However, it is less expensive than the other.  My skin feels so much better now.  Imagine that.</li>
    <li> I love this soap! My boyfriend uses it and he smells really, really good!</li>
    <li> I bought this to use in my hair. I thought that I had read somewhere that it would be less damaging than shampoos and this was a good alternative. No. Don&#x27;t make the same mistake. I use it as regular soap now and it&#x27;s okay. Nothing special.</li>
    <li> I love this soap and have used it for years. It is hard to find in the super market but I can always find it here.</li>
    <li> First I tried the cheap soaps, Irish Spring, Lever 2000, dial, etc.  After that I tried the more expensive soaps, namely, Dove.  I didn&#x27;t see any real benefit to any of the soaps I was using but Dove seemed to work better... maybe.  The point is, I wasn&#x27;t really sure.  I was at the store buying another pack of Dove soap when I remembered I kept hearing radio advertisements on Infowars about natural soap and how much better it was.  The advertisements I kept hearing were for cal-ben soap which I really didn&#x27;t want to pay all that money and pay shipping on top of it, just to try it out.  I decided to see if the store I was at had any natural soaps.  I found Kirk&#x27;s Castile soap.  I looked over the ingredients of both the dove soap I had in my hand and the Kirk&#x27;s soap.  The Kirk&#x27;s soap only has a few all-natural ingredients while the dove soap had about 30 ingredients of which most I could not pronounce.  I decided to give the Kirk&#x27;s soap a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very first thing I noticed was that I only had to lather the wash cloth one time during my shower where as I would have to lather the cloth at least 3-4 times with other soaps. Second, my skin feels a lot more smooth.  3rd, my skin is not itchy and any little scrapes or cuts I get seem to go away a lot faster.  Last, my skin seems to be a lot more clear.  I know coconut oil is supposed to have many benefits.  It&#x27;s supposed to moisturize, treat acne, and slow aging of the skin.  I&#x27;v only been using the soap for a few days so I can&#x27;t comment on the benefits, however, this does truly seem to be a superior soap.  I have found this soap locally for about $1 a bar (in a 3 pack) so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d pay the ~$8 here but I&#x27;ll definitely be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this product to make homemade laundry soap.  It&#x27;s a great base, all natural and perfect for sensitive skin and for my baby&#x27;s clothing.</li>
    <li> This is the best bar soap I know of.  I usually buy it at Albertson&#x27;s in the bar soap section.  I&#x27;ve used it for about eight years,  It&#x27;s easy on my skin, makes me feel nice and clean, and it has no scent.  It does have a pleasant, faint clean smell that to me smells just the way soap (and I) should smell.  No anti bacterial ingredients, no deodorant additives - it&#x27;s just plain soap.  In a pinch I&#x27;ve used it for my hair and for hand washing when traveling.  I take a nearly used up small bar in my travel kit.  One can never tell when one will need some good soap.  The bars I bought recently were from amazon because it was cheaper to buy them in multiple packages, and the shipping was amazon Prime.  I can&#x27;t imagine switching brands for any reason.</li>
    <li> I use this to make homemade laundry detergent and it works great with Borax and washing soda!</li>
    <li> This is a soap I used to see in farmhouses when I was a child because it lathered like crazy, even in hard water.  Saw it in a drug store a few years ago and really liked it.  Hard to find in NYC, so I took to online retailers.  I like it in winter because it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin, but doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy either, like most moisturizing soaps do.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  My wife doesn&#x27;t really like the smell, but I do.  Also this stuff suds like nobodies business.  I have been using bronners soap and well this stuff is cheaper and better.</li>
    <li> I have never tried this product before. I am extremely pleased with it. I would encourage you to try it</li>
    <li> If you want lots of lather and deep cleaning lather than you need to get some of this soap. I call it lye soap because it is looks like my mother&#x27;s lye soap she used to make from wood ashes. I am not sure if this is made the same way but it is like her old soap used to be.</li>
    <li> purer prooduct than most  soaps.</li>
    <li> I use this soap with washing soda and borax. With some Oxiclean and some Dawn dish soap, it gets our clothes just as clean as they would&#x27;ve been if we used a branded detergent, and the cost is less than half of buying detergent.</li>
    <li> My husband likes this soap to the exclusion of all others as it works no matter how hard or soft the water might be. It is also easy on the nose in the fragrance department - no sneezing or bothering my allergies!</li>
    <li> Amazon is currently listing three versions of this soap. In reality I believe there are only two (original and fragrance free). And the original, also listed as \\&quot;Coconut\\&quot; by Amazon, smells nothing like coconut to me. The fragrance is more like just a sort of soap smell. I ordered all three because I thought there were actually three scents. I know coconut is the main ingredient, just saying to me it doesn&#x27;t have much of a coconut smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is pretty good I guess. Lathers up a lot, and rinses off easily like everyone else said. I was previously using Dove for men, but trying this for a while because I think I may have a soap allergy. Not sure yet which one I like better. I definitely prefer the smell of Dove \\&quot;Extra Fresh\\&quot; better. I suspect most people buy this soap because it&#x27;s natural or because of an allergy to soap, so I doubt that&#x27;s a useful comparison. Mainly I just want to mention that there seem to be only two versions of this soap, not three.</li>
    <li> While the soap bars are great and last a really long time, they seem to be more drying on my skin than the liquid version. I went back to the liquid and the other 2 bars are still sitting in the closet.</li>
    <li> Fine!&lt;br /&gt;I was not satisfied with the price- thought I would receive two packs of 3 units ea.&lt;br /&gt;Product is fine.</li>
    <li> My regular soap. Very sudsy in had water.</li>
    <li> I used to use this soap until I found out the company uses palm oil. Palm oil production is pushing orangutans to extinction in violent and painful ways. I&#x27;d like to use this product if they would use an oil that isn&#x27;t harmful to wildlife.</li>
    <li> The best for making liquid soap or putting in pour and mold soaps</li>
    <li> MAKES A GREAT LAUNDRY SOAP WITH A LITTLE GRATING AND WATER AND BORAX ADDED</li>
    <li> I am enjoying this natural soap because it lathers very well (which not all natural soaps do!) and it smells nice as well. I will be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> Great and natural....not those deodorant bars which you smell on your face all day and mark your eyes stick.</li>
    <li> Great.  Good price, here, on a tough to find product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of this soap, and I have been using it as face wash, body wash, shaving cream and shampoo. It has a great lather and leaves my hair feeling very clean without having that squeaky clean stripped feeling. It is a little bit drying on my face and skin, but I haven&#x27;t had a breakout since I started using it! I usually follow it up with pure coconut oil anyway. I definitely recommend this soap! Oh, PS. don&#x27;t get this stuff in your eyes unless you really want to punish yourself. It has got some serious burn to it!</li>
    <li> The soap is of excellent quality, and is not readily available at the local supermarkets. Its mild like Ivory soap, but much smoother, and not heavily scented. It cleans well, and leaves the skin not dried out. Great product.</li>
    <li> This is a better value than the more expensive castile soaps.  This lathers very strongly.  Many fragrances cause very strong allergic response for me, but this one is pleasant without offense.  I would describe the smell as a very faint &amp;#34;1980s motel soap.&amp;#34; There is a fragrance free version for more sensitive individuals.</li>
    <li> Much better than the average soaps which are just loaded with junk and chemicals. I&#x27;ve stopped using all that toxic junk (Dial, Dove, Lever2000, Olay) and I&#x27;m never going back to all those chemicals ever again. Kirks Castile has pure all natural ingredients, except for the fragrance which is why I always buy fragrance-free. Hint: I&#x27;ve recently found that the best price is to actually buy directly from the Kirks Castile manufacturers website, especially if you want the fragrance-free version.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just ok. This soap was recommended by friends at a hospital, so we were expecting far more. I would rate his a 4-1/2. It works perfectly fine.</li>
    <li> I really like the soap bar for the quality of less suds and smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived with only one bar in the package and nothing came further.&lt;br /&gt;So sorry !</li>
    <li> Great about cleaning gunk buildup out of your hair. I can&#x27;t use it every day because my hair is not oily. Love the smell.</li>
    <li> Best soap ever - Used to use Dr. Bronners.  I am super sensitive and can&#x27;t use anything with fragrance or a lot of other ingredients in it.  This is perfect!  Hard to find - initially found @ Walgreens, but they don&#x27;t carry it anymore - happy I found it here!  I use Dr bronners liquid for body wash as well!  Great for baby skin also!</li>
    <li> My son has super sensitive skin and this is the only soap we can use on him.  It smells great and leaves his skin so nice!  I even use this product on my face  - we LOVE this stuff!!  And it&#x27;s natural to boot!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a more natural type soap and I do like this one.  It cleans well, has some sudsing, and has just a mild fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is the best natural soap available.  I&#x27;ve been using Kirk&#x27;s Castile for 6 years and would never switch to another soap again.</li>
    <li> Best overall soap I&#x27;ve used.  Non-drying.  I&#x27;ve given up those bath soaps in the bottles and am only using this soap now.</li>
    <li> Be careful, if you have little cuts on your body it will burn the heck out of it. You will smell like a gramps with this soap. Meh, will not buy again. It&#x27;s over priced ivory soap in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for several years.  It is a good, very gentle soap.  I had been ordering it from the manufacturer, but was glad to find it on amazon, where I could order a smaller amount instead of a whole case.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. It lathers well and leaves my skin feeling clean, but not all dried out.  I love that it is a more natural product than most.</li>
    <li> Such a creamy soap.. light fragrance. Great service from the seller.</li>
    <li> This is my complete shower soap, shampoo and toothpaste. Best decision I ever made.</li>
    <li> This is the best non-allergenic soap I have ever found.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know I needed this soap as much as I did until I started using it every day. It has helped my skin irritation issues immensely. Who knew the pH of skin needed this help?</li>
    <li> really like this product, totaly natural. I have very sensitive skin and this is great, no break outs or anything at all. Very prompt shipping&lt;br /&gt;thanx</li>
    <li> This is the loveliest soap you can use. It&#x27;s all natural and soothing and has a pleasant fragrance. I use it almost every day. So gentle and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Love this soap. I got these bars as kind of a add on. Boy was I surprised how great this soap is. Lathers good, smells really fresh and doesn&#x27;t dry your skin.</li>
</ol>
