      <li>Good stuff!</li>
      <li>Great product and seller.</li>
      <li>The cape &amp; jacket do a great job at keeping hair off you.</li>
      <li>Great item for the money.</li>
      <li>Looks good, good material and quality.</li>
      <li>but alright for the price the cape is good</li>
      <li>When it was finished, and I pulled it from the washer, it laughed at me in defiance and said, \\&quot;you thought you could brake me but you have failed.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>Good for the price, looks like the picture.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery great product loved it!</li>
      <li>The cape is nice in the way it covers a lot &amp; keeps hair off.</li>
      <li>good quality cape fits great and helps keep people clean and hair free.</li>
      <li>Great deal and fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t like that the pocket is at the top instead of the bottom</li>
      <li>okay is tha t</li>
      <li>The cape is ok.</li>
      <li>It is a one size fits most.</li>
      <li>FINE BY THE SUMMER.</li>
      <li>This makes a great gift or quality enough for the salon.</li>
      <li>Looks good so far, but haven&#x27;t used them during a cut yet.</li>
      <li>The cape covers a lot and the jacket is good enough.</li>
      <li>I got it for my son , who is going to school, he just loves it, is very nice, and looks very professional, he said that the other students ask him all the time where did he get</li>
      <li>So to finish on a positive note - you can spill your coffee on it and it will run right off.</li>
      <li>The cape is exactly what I wanted but the jacket is way too big even though it says one size fits most.</li>
      <li>Quick shipping over a holiday weekend and the product seems to be made of  high quality material.</li>
      <li>Another positive is that it doesn&#x27;t get too hot when you&#x27;re wearing this.</li>
      <li>im pretty sure the jacket was designed by or for a female because the jacket is kinda tight in the midsection, and its left sided zipper, it also has a funny chest pocket that i cant seem to find good for anything, i also find hairs sticking to the jacket and poke through.</li>
      <li>overall not bad, does the job.</li>
      <li>but if you have to live in it all day, like I do, you would give it a 2 stat rating too.</li>
      <li>And even if the jacket did fit me, I find it very odd that the pocket is so high up.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a small guy around 5&#x27;7&amp;#34; and the jacket was huge on me feels like paper</li>
      <li>VERY PLEASED WITH ITEMS, THE BARBER JACKET IS A LITTLE TO SMALL.</li>
      <li>When I first got it, and seen how stiff it was, I throw it in the washer hoping that washing it would brake it down and make it easier to live with.</li>

    <li> This stuff works well. The cape covers a lot and the jacket is good enough.</li>
    <li> The cape &amp; jacket do a great job at keeping hair off you. The cape is nice in the way it covers a lot &amp; keeps hair off.</li>
    <li> Probably not as heavy duty as professional ones but they definitely keep cut hair off my clothes and arms! Another positive is that it doesn&#x27;t get too hot when you&#x27;re wearing this.</li>
    <li> Product did not have a size in description and was the wrong size when I received it. It is a one size fits most. 42-52.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery great product loved it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a small guy around 5&#x27;7&amp;#34; and the jacket was huge on me feels like paper but alright for the price the cape is good</li>
    <li> Hair still gets on the clothes.</li>
    <li> They work like a charm!  Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Quick shipping over a holiday weekend and the product seems to be made of  high quality material. Looks good so far, but haven&#x27;t used them during a cut yet.</li>
    <li> Great deal and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I got it for my son , who is going to school, he just loves it, is very nice, and looks very professional, he said that the other students ask him all the time where did he get and he tells them, Amazon, my mom gave it to my ask as a Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> VERY PLEASED WITH ITEMS, THE BARBER JACKET IS A LITTLE TO SMALL. MIGHT NEED TO LOSE SOME STOMACH IT WILL&lt;br /&gt;FIT FINE BY THE SUMMER.</li>
    <li> Too stiff even after washing it a couple of times</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like that the pocket is at the top instead of the bottom okay is tha t enough s i</li>
    <li> I decided I would try this product because of the price, but wish I had my money back. It would work for the occasional hair cutter but if you have to live in it all day, like I do, you would give it a 2 stat rating too. I&#x27;m not going into the \\&quot;one size fits most\\&quot; part of it ( that&#x27;s like saying \\&quot;you should have know better\\&quot;) but the thing that is the biggest problem is the material that it is made of. It reminds me of the stuff that cheep rain suites are made of. it&#x27;s stiff, loud, and doesn&#x27;t breath. When I first got it, and seen how stiff it was, I throw it in the washer hoping that washing it would brake it down and make it easier to live with. As the water ran over it - it beaded up and ran off. When it was finished, and I pulled it from the washer, it laughed at me in defiance and said, \\&quot;you thought you could brake me but you have failed.\\&quot; So to finish on a positive note - you can spill your coffee on it and it will run right off.</li>
    <li> The cape is ok. The jacket on the other hand is uncomfortable no way could I work in this. It feels like plastic.</li>
    <li> The cape is exactly what I wanted but the jacket is way too big even though it says one size fits most. And even if the jacket did fit me, I find it very odd that the pocket is so high up.</li>
    <li> Excellent purchase for price.</li>
    <li> Looks good, good material and quality. This makes a great gift or quality enough for the salon. Great item for the money.</li>
    <li> Horrible fabric. Doesn&#x27;t move at all. Waste of money</li>
    <li> good quality cape fits great and helps keep people clean and hair free. im pretty sure the jacket was designed by or for a female because the jacket is kinda tight in the midsection, and its left sided zipper, it also has a funny chest pocket that i cant seem to find good for anything, i also find hairs sticking to the jacket and poke through. overall not bad, does the job.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for the fabric it&#x27;s made of. It&#x27;s too stiff.</li>
    <li> Good for the price, looks like the picture.</li>
    <li> Great product and seller.</li>
    <li> Great set! Fits perfectly for my friend</li>
