      <li>Calendula oil is amazing!</li>
      <li>The price of product was great &amp; i felt like it was a good quality product as well.</li>
      <li>I put some of the oil on my hands to see if it would be a good rub</li>
      <li>In my opinion I don&#x27;t think the solution is very potent.</li>
      <li>and it was an amazing difference.</li>
      <li>I contacted the seller for a return and Wise Ways Herbals was most gracious in handling this concern.</li>
      <li>The oil WAS nicely packaged and arrived in a timely manner.</li>
      <li>Bought this to mix with beeswax to make my own lip balms.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
      <li>I have a ton of safe organic products</li>
      <li>Love this oil.</li>
      <li>nice smooth oil .....</li>
      <li>This is the best my feet have been in several years.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I feel like this is more Olive oil than the Calendula Oil.</li>
      <li>I have tried spray, oil and salve and love all of them.</li>
      <li>but if I was better about using it every day it would probably take care of that.  </li>
      <li>This is OK, nothing to rave about.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>My feet aren&#x27;t perfect but this has helped better than any other oil, ointment, or cream</li>
      <li>Just because it is oily, I must admit that my face is more blemish free then ever before.  </li>
      <li>and it did absorb fine</li>
      <li>This product is amazing and of high quality...</li>
      <li>This oil pours easily, pretty much odorless, nice viscosity.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, which is good, but I think using it regularly would be too oily and will eventually clog up your pores.</li>
      <li>I also add it along with green tea and olive oil to my foot baths and it feels sooo good!</li>
      <li>Look no further, this is great oil at a very competitive price.</li>
      <li>I sent it with five drops of lavender essential oil, and the baby and mom love it!</li>
      <li>I have used it for several months before writing this review so I could give some honest feedback.</li>
      <li>After only one month, I cannot imagine that I will find a better product (no matter the cost) and this product is very reasonable!  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I use it on my dogs a lot for hot spots or fleas.</li>
      <li>Be sure, if you order this product, that it arrives properly sealed.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>They will modify their future listings to better describe the product and pricing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>used for years  and never failed me.  </li>
      <li>I will order more in the future.</li>
      <li>It was exactly what I ordered.</li>
      <li>Have found Calendula  to really  be THE healing  oil.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
      <li>Fast delivery</li>
      <li>Should be marketed as a &amp;#34;blend&amp;#34; rather than, &amp;#34;Calendula Oil 4 Ounces&amp;#34; since it is a blend and there is no way to tell how much calendula oil is truly in the 4 oz bottle.  </li>
      <li>Let me warn, it is very oily.  </li>
      <li>The areas where my skin is dry will be moist and normal the next day, so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
      <li>This oil will be a good carrier oil (I don&#x27;t want to waste it), but I definitely won&#x27;t order it again.</li>
      <li>but I gave it 4 stars because I think the price is way too high.</li>
      <li>Rather than return, I am going to put it into a soap batch as I had planned but will not purchase again because of the high cost and the research I did after I received the oil.</li>
      <li>I have used plain olive oil on my skin before and this seems to be nothing more than olive oil.</li>
      <li>won&#x27;t buy this again and will get some more pure calendula, or a product which at least lists the ratios or dilution of the oils.</li>
      <li>body butter recipe called for a &amp;#34;light oil&amp;#34; in addition to all the other stuff, so I thought this would suffice as both the healing properties of the calendula and the light oil, but it seems that the ratio of Calendula Oil to Olive oil favors the olive</li>
      <li>This has not hurt my complexion in any way, only improved it very much.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps my skin is more tough than it is sensitive (?), but it didn&#x27;t irritate me or seem strong enough for my skin.</li>
      <li>I have not experienced any more &amp;#34;white heads&amp;#34; like I did with so many other creams.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m fairly certain there is not enough Calendula oil in here to reap</li>
      <li>calendula not in pure form its mixed with a carrier oil</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used a natural product which had calendula in it</li>
      <li>I use this oil for my dry cracked feet and it has really helped.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I will consider ordering their products in the future provided the description is clear.</li>
      <li>It is perfect to use as a base oil in mixing different blends of essential oils.  </li>
      <li>Disappointing, since I&#x27;d heard good things about this oil.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d been noticing of late, that my skin has been looking rather dry and that caused the appearance of EVEN MORE lines.  </li>
      <li>however this was the only one that actually worked to clear it up!</li>
      <li>It will last for several months based on my use so far.  </li>
      <li>but it had nowhere near the effect on my eczema as did a different more expensive brand which i am now switching back to.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps it is a catch 22 because the calendula oil is supposed to have a &#x27;spoiled&#x27; smell and this does have a slight off smell like it wants to be rancid.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i thought i would try this cheaper brand but it had nowhere near the effect on my eczema as did a different more expensive brand which i am now switching back to.  it ultimately felt like and had the scent of olive oil.</li>
    <li> Love this oil. It was exactly what I ordered.</li>
    <li> This oil pours easily, pretty much odorless, nice viscosity.  I used it for making a balm and it blended wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I like the calendula oil.  It is perfect to use as a base oil in mixing different blends of essential oils.  I will order more in the future.</li>
    <li> This is OK, nothing to rave about. Doesn&#x27;t help for my acne. It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, which is good, but I think using it regularly would be too oily and will eventually clog up your pores. I use it to moisturize my face once a week or every two weeks. The areas where my skin is dry will be moist and normal the next day, so that&#x27;s nice. I feel like this is more Olive oil than the Calendula Oil. I think I probably need to order the concentrated Calendula Oil next time. Perhaps my skin is more tough than it is sensitive (?), but it didn&#x27;t irritate me or seem strong enough for my skin. I rub it all over my face, even in the area that is not red or acne, but it didn&#x27;t irritate or anything. I will continue to use this sporadically to moisten my skin.</li>
    <li> Used it for my knee pain, I did notice a difference in the amount of pain that I was experiencing. I would recommend this item to others!</li>
    <li> Love it. Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> Bought this to mix with beeswax to make my own lip balms. It wasn&#x27;t oily enough for me. The beeswax took over.</li>
    <li> I should have read the reviews prior to purchasing this product.  Thought it was calendula oil, not a blend.  Essentially I overpaid for a bottle of olive oil with some calendula in it.  Should be marketed as a &amp;#34;blend&amp;#34; rather than, &amp;#34;Calendula Oil 4 Ounces&amp;#34; since it is a blend and there is no way to tell how much calendula oil is truly in the 4 oz bottle.  A tad misleading.  The oil WAS nicely packaged and arrived in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Mixed with olive oil too dilute I wanted the oil of calendula and less diluted for healing my skin I have used this oil before</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fairly certain there is not enough Calendula oil in here to reap any benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made a body butter and wanted to add the calendula to help with healing the breaks in the skin (psoriasis). I&#x27;ve used a natural product which had calendula in it and it was an amazing difference. I don&#x27;t see any difference when using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My body butter recipe called for a &amp;#34;light oil&amp;#34; in addition to all the other stuff, so I thought this would suffice as both the healing properties of the calendula and the light oil, but it seems that the ratio of Calendula Oil to Olive oil favors the olive oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t buy this again and will get some more pure calendula, or a product which at least lists the ratios or dilution of the oils.</li>
    <li> I had never tried Calendula oil before and I was so blown away by how well it worked on my face.  I had dry skin/eczema at my hairline and after i used this product for a couple days, it was gone. This product also works well for acne and getting a couple pimples on my chin to recover faster than without using Calendula oil.  Even though it&#x27;s oil, it didn&#x27;t clog my pores. A great product. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Calendula oil is amazing! I bought this for myself. I was using it for perineum stretching for before and during child labor. I still had a ton left over and started to use it on my baby.  It has wonderful healing properties! I use this on my babies diaper rash! this is the only thing that will take his rash away! I have a ton of safe organic products however this was the only one that actually worked to clear it up!</li>
    <li> Not exactly thrilled with product since it was so expensive. Never purchased before. In my opinion I don&#x27;t think the solution is very potent. Perhaps it is a catch 22 because the calendula oil is supposed to have a &#x27;spoiled&#x27; smell and this does have a slight off smell like it wants to be rancid. However it is slight and not strong. I put some of the oil on my hands to see if it would be a good rub and it did absorb fine and there was no strong smell left behind. In doing research on calendula oil the mixture is supposed to be thick and this is very thin. The carrier oil is olive oil and in my opinion the calendula could be a bit stronger concoction. I have used plain olive oil on my skin before and this seems to be nothing more than olive oil. I feel that the calendula is so miniscule that it has no benefit. Rather than return, I am going to put it into a soap batch as I had planned but will not purchase again because of the high cost and the research I did after I received the oil. It is regrettable but happens when you shop via online means and can&#x27;t see and smell and look in person for some things. These comments are just my opinion. I have not had any other calendula oil so I have no comparison. It isn&#x27;t what I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> I use this oil for my dry cracked feet and it has really helped.  Just ordered my second bottle, a little goes a long way.  My feet aren&#x27;t perfect but this has helped better than any other oil, ointment, or cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  My skin still flakes but if I was better about using it every day it would probably take care of that.  This is the best my feet have been in several years.  I also add it along with green tea and olive oil to my foot baths and it feels sooo good!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Works great in my soaps and creams.</li>
    <li> This is high grade olive oil with so little calendula in it that all you smell is olive oil. You can&#x27;t even count it as scented olive oil.</li>
    <li> wonderful oil will order again</li>
    <li> Perfect mix of the calendula oil, but I gave it 4 stars because I think the price is way too high.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this is a small bottle of olive oil with *maybe* a little bit of calendula in it...  I&#x27;ve since ordered a few other brands of calendula blend and you can actually smell the calendula in it.  This oil will be a good carrier oil (I don&#x27;t want to waste it), but I definitely won&#x27;t order it again.</li>
    <li> works great for baby oil. I sent it with five drops of lavender essential oil, and the baby and mom love it!</li>
    <li> I did a lot of looking around before purchasing this brand of calendula oil and I&#x27;m glad I did. I have used it for several months before writing this review so I could give some honest feedback. Look no further, this is great oil at a very competitive price. Buy it, with your money.

    <li> I bought this on a whim having read something somewhere on the internet.  I&#x27;d been noticing of late, that my skin has been looking rather dry and that caused the appearance of EVEN MORE lines.  I know it&#x27;s winter and this dry effect is common for me.  But ... I thought the dry look was extreme (maybe 63 yo is the reason).  I have been using this for about one month.  It will last for several months based on my use so far.  About 4-6 drops for my face and neck and another 6 drops for hands and wrist.  What a difference I have experienced!  I know every body is different, but this product has replaced all of my expensive creams.  After only one month, I cannot imagine that I will find a better product (no matter the cost) and this product is very reasonable!  Let me warn, it is very oily.  I like it best at night before going to bed, but also use it every morning.  I let it sit while I&#x27;m dressing and fixing my hair.  I sometimes dab it at oilier spots, if I put too much on, but usually by the time I&#x27;ve dressed and curled my hair, II can apply my face-powder with no oily residue peeping through.  (Warning Again: every body is different).  Just because it is oily, I must admit that my face is more blemish free then ever before.  I have not experienced any more &amp;#34;white heads&amp;#34; like I did with so many other creams.  This has not hurt my complexion in any way, only improved it very much.  I will be buying is this again and again.</li>
    <li> nice smooth oil .....took a while to get it but it is calendula oil mixed with olive carrier oil. calendula not in pure form its mixed with a carrier oil</li>
    <li> Arrived as expected! I used it in a tattoo balm and read that calendula has anti itch properties, which is why I bought this, but it didn&#x27;t help in that regard.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. In no matter form that I have used it. I have tried spray, oil and salve and love all of them. The oil seems to be the messiest but what ever your preference is. I use it on my dogs a lot for hot spots or fleas.</li>
    <li> I use this for making homemade soaps and lotions.  A little goes a long way.  Fast delivery I recommend this product for whatever you needs are.</li>
    <li> It was shipped to me on time. The price of product was great &amp; i felt like it was a good quality product as well.</li>
    <li> Calendula oils...  I would call &amp;#34;healing&amp;#34; oils.  Have found Calendula  to really  be THE healing  oil.&lt;br /&gt;Have used for years  and never failed me.  NEVER without this product.. and  purchased it at Amazon  with savings!</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and packaged well with recycled materials. However, this was not the product pictured and listed on Amazon.  I contacted the seller for a return and Wise Ways Herbals was most gracious in handling this concern. They will modify their future listings to better describe the product and pricing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will consider ordering their products in the future provided the description is clear.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing and of high quality... I recommend it for any of your skin problems (like eczema, etc). scalp problems, and even hemorrhoids!</li>
    <li> This is a product that needs to be sanitary; there is supposed to be a seal on the bottle. However, the bottle I received had no seal.  Amazon will give me a refund, but cannot replace it because it&#x27;s from a third-party seller.  Disappointing, since I&#x27;d heard good things about this oil.  Be sure, if you order this product, that it arrives properly sealed.</li>
