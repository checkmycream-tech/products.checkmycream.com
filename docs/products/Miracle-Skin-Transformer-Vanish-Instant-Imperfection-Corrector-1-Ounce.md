      <li>It spreads easily.  </li>
      <li>Treat fine lines/aging, sun</li>
      <li>Amazon has the best price for it now, as the sale ended and went back to a higher price.  </li>
      <li>It goes on silky smooth and I can tell that its working to smooth out some of my freckles and fine lines.</li>
      <li>I just had never used anything that felt that good on my skin and made it look so smooth and natural.  </li>
      <li>I like it leaves your skin looking smooth</li>
      <li>I received a sample of this cream and thought it was fantastic, so had hi expectations when the bottle arrived.  </li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed re wrinkles, but this is totally worth it for me!  </li>
      <li>The first time I used it I fell in love with it, and decided to buy the full size.  </li>

      <li>I don&#x27;t regret it, and this product is worth the price.  </li>
      <li>I have only used it a couple of times and I&#x27;m not even sure why.</li>
      <li>At 46, that is saying something, It is not heavy and greasy, which is extremely important to me.</li>
      <li>I bought it elsewhere first on sale to try it out.  </li>

      <li>I first tried it when received as a sample.  </li>
      <li>I noticed the difference within the first 2 days of using it.</li>
      <li>I love the product itself, but there was not very much in that tube for the price.</li>
      <li>it is very pricy for no results</li>
      <li>I have used it for a month and looked at my face and all but one of the brown spots, and that one is much lighter.  </li>
      <li>Maybe I was expecting too much.</li>
      <li>I really like it, but it&#x27;s obscenely overpriced.</li>
      <li>It makes my complexion look so much brighter and healthier.</li>
      <li>I bought this one and it really does even out the skin</li>
      <li>and I decided to just use the samples sparingly for when I really wanted to look and feel finished.  </li>
      <li>the other hand, I use the tinted moisturizer every day and love that product.</li>
      <li>It feels like good moisturizing cream, not itchy at all, and makes a nice base for blush and eye makeup.</li>
      <li>It only takes a small amount, slides on like silk and makes my skin feel and look amazing and fresh.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend</li>
      <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older I need something to smooth out some of the lines and spots, but I can&#x27;t be bothered to match makeup to my skin tone and own a bunch of different bottles for different seasons, plus foundation usually feels itchy to me.</li>
      <li>I am 64 and thought I had to live with them.  </li>
      <li>If this product came in a clear tube I would have no idea what it was for.  </li>
      <li>it makes my face really soft</li>
      <li>I have a normal-to-dry skin with early signs of aging.</li>
      <li>Perhaps if you have early signs of facial lines this product will work.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it!  It completely lightened dark area on my cheek.  I also use as a primer.</li>
    <li> Product claims: Treat fine lines/aging, sun damage/environmental stresses, dark spots and dullness. It does none of these things. I used the product twice a day as recommended over moisturizer and see no difference after using up the bottle. All I can say is that it felt nice on my face, the claimed benefits are just not there.</li>
    <li> This sells for 60 at Sephora, Ulta, and Kohls. Thank you !</li>
    <li> Product did not work for me as I had hoped. My face felt greasy and I broke out quite a bit. Will not be using again.</li>
    <li> This works great for brown spots due to the sun.  It also seems to even out my complexion.  I just love it.  It spreads easily.  I use it under my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This lotion feels good in my face it has make some acne marks a little less dark, it last about two months daily application under my makeup base</li>
    <li> This is the second time I ordered this product. Both times, the cap cracked &amp; will not stay on.  I will not be reordering again.</li>
    <li> If this product came in a clear tube I would have no idea what it was for.  All it did was make my skin feel a bit greasy before I applied my make up. Total waste of money, especially for the size.</li>
    <li> Very good product my wife purchased.  She likes it and says it works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Helps my makeup apply smoother</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It goes on silky smooth and I can tell that its working to smooth out some of my freckles and fine lines. I&#x27;ll be continuing to buy this, for sure.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I use it before using a BB cream or Miracle Skin Spotlight Face. It only takes a small amount, slides on like silk and makes my skin feel and look amazing and fresh. At 46, that is saying something, It is not heavy and greasy, which is extremely important to me. A little goes a long way making the price easier to swallow and I am definitely a fan and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It got rid of the oily shine that I use to have and gives my complexion a bright even tone. My foundation stays on all day.</li>
    <li> Perhaps if you have early signs of facial lines this product will work. After all the hype I hoped it would do something.</li>
    <li> I love the Miracle Skin transformer products, including the makeup and the face wash.  This didn&#x27;t do anything for me but did irritate my skin.  Probably should have sent it back.</li>
    <li> I like it leaves your skin looking smooth so whatever you apply on top looks even better...  Ill keep buying it</li>
    <li> works wonders on my oily skin...makeup looks flawless!!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I first tried it when received as a sample.  It came with the tinted moisturizer and face wash.  The first time I used it I fell in love with it, and decided to buy the full size.  The price was a deterrent and I decided to just use the samples sparingly for when I really wanted to look and feel finished.  Every time I used it, I loved it more.  Makes my skin look flawless.  Finally decided to bite the bullet and get the product.  I just had never used anything that felt that good on my skin and made it look so smooth and natural.  I use the Vanish, tinted moisturizer, face wash and triple night cream.  The Vanish and Triple night cream last about 3 months.  The face wash lasts about 4 months and the tinted moisturizer lasts about 5 - 6 months.  You don&#x27;t need to use a lot, a little goes a very long way.  I don&#x27;t regret it, and this product is worth the price.  You can feel a difference in the texture of your skin the 1st time you use it.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this cream and thought it was fantastic, so had hi expectations when the bottle arrived.  It hasn&#x27;t quite lived-up to them.  Probably it does make pores look smaller and skin smoother, but that&#x27;s all I notice.</li>
    <li> Maybe I was expecting too much. I have only used it a couple of times and I&#x27;m not even sure why. I can&#x27;t tell that it does anything at all. I wish I could return it since I&#x27;m never going to use it and it was costly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, I use the tinted moisturizer every day and love that product.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Costco.  I must say that I have noticed a huge difference in my many brown spots on my face. I am 64 and thought I had to live with them.  I have used it for a month and looked at my face and all but one of the brown spots, and that one is much lighter.  Haven&#x27;t noticed re wrinkles, but this is totally worth it for me!  I will continue to use this!  Great product.</li>
    <li> I love this cream...it makes my face really soft</li>
    <li> I have a normal-to-dry skin with early signs of aging. This product really dries my skin and makes it look worse. The packaging itself should be improved because it is really hard to get the product out of the container. What really disappointed me is that the tube I got looked like it was already used as a sample someplace. It was half empty.  I think it is better to buy cosmetic products from the store where you can test it and see that the package you pay for is new and full.</li>
    <li> works great as a Primer, I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay products it gets too shiny on my forehead which I don&#x27;t like I hardly use it might not for me but for other individuals. It&#x27;s not worth it for me it&#x27;s okay! But you can try it you might like it it&#x27;s a great product.!</li>
    <li> Best primer on the market.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Love it.  Makes my skin smooth and clear, diminishes pores.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. As I&#x27;ve gotten older I need something to smooth out some of the lines and spots, but I can&#x27;t be bothered to match makeup to my skin tone and own a bunch of different bottles for different seasons, plus foundation usually feels itchy to me.

It feels like good moisturizing cream, not itchy at all, and makes a nice base for blush and eye makeup. I put it on after moisturizer. I don&#x27;t use powder with it--the itchy thing--but I&#x27;m sure you could. As a bonus, I don&#x27;t leave beige streaks on my husband if I lean my cheek on his shoulder. :)</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as well as Miracle Skin Transformer</li>
    <li> I love this product. It makes my complexion look so much brighter and healthier. I use it after moisturizer under makeup.</li>
    <li> I love the product itself, but there was not very much in that tube for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had so many compliments on my skin!  Smooth&#x27;s out your skin and accepts your makeup flawlessly!  Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Worked we&#x27;ll in the beginning then not as well. Hope taking a break from using it will allow the initial results.</li>
    <li> I really like it, but it&#x27;s obscenely overpriced.</li>
    <li> did nothing  kinda drying to skin has not done a thing. waiting for corrections  it is very pricy for no results</li>
    <li> Great, makes skin look flawless.</li>
    <li> This stuff works....I have a flawless face and no wrinkles or age spots glaring!</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever!!  A friend recommended it to me and my skin looks so much better.  I just wish it was easier to find.  Ulta stores had it at one time, but no more.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this from Nordstrom and liked it. I bought this one and it really does even out the skin</li>
    <li> Love it you can use it instead of primer it is awesome.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this cream.  I bought it elsewhere first on sale to try it out.  It was so amazing!  Amazon has the best price for it now, as the sale ended and went back to a higher price.  I will definitely be ordering this again and again.  My face feels smother and my skin tone more even.  I noticed the difference within the first 2 days of using it.</li>
