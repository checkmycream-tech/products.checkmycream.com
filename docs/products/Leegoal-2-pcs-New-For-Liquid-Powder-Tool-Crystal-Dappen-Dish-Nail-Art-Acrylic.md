<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i do my own nails and my friends nails and these are amazing. perfect size dishes and great value. i would buy them again</li>
    <li> Fair warning they are alot smaller then expected they are probably 1 inch by 1 inch</li>
    <li> Highly recommended. Received today 11/30/2014 Thanks</li>
    <li> i love the dishes unfortunately one was cracked upon delivery.</li>
    <li> They work so well, and they are what I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> One was broken when I got it</li>
    <li> Very small containers</li>
    <li> Much smaller than expected.</li>
    <li> I love both of them, both are a different style, came in really late, but that&#x27;s O.K, came packaged well, will be using this all the time</li>
    <li> They are about a 2oz glass thought they were bigger</li>
    <li> These are super tiny but serve their purpose works great</li>
    <li> One had a small chip, but they are great</li>
    <li> smaller then I expected</li>
    <li> I thought they would b a lil bigger but it&#x27;s ok because I only do my nails so I dont need a large amount of the liquid or the powder</li>
    <li> items pictured is not what was recieved, the lids are larger than the bowl and do not stay on, but is sufficent for my needs</li>
    <li> The items bought above were broken upon arrival, they are very smaller than what the picture seems. The size is about a quarter coin comparison.</li>
    <li> 1. I thought these where going to be much bigger, but these are tiny i cant even use them. 2. One of mind is broken and its not even worth thr hassle of returning it. Im pissed!</li>
    <li> NEVER AGAIN!!!! THEY ARE SO SMALL IT&#x27;S EMBARRASSING CAN EVEN FIT A LITTLE LIQUID</li>
    <li> this is the first time i am displeased with anything i  have ordered for my home, family, or business from amazon! the item i received does not match what is shown here. i was sent 2 tiny heart shape glass (not crystal) trinket boxes with ill fitting lids. anyone who would be ordering these knows you need the lid to fit properly on a dampen dish t retain your liquid...also they are so small i cant even put enough liquid in one to service a single client! i would not recommend buying these. i&#x27;m totally bummed...i was looking forward to getting the pretty dampen dishes shown in the picture :-(</li>
    <li> I like them but they don&#x27;t hold much and they are much smaller than what I thought they would be.</li>
    <li> While the jars I got are adorable they are not what I ordered and the lids do not fit very well</li>
    <li> Good item for the price. Shipping does take a while though.</li>
    <li> Takes for ever and im still waiting for this ..&lt;br /&gt;Never again.. Takes to much to get it.? Wow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will get it to an actually store.</li>
    <li> great, I dont have to smell that stuff so much when I use these for nail acrylic supplies. I think it can be used for other things if your creative enough.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE SIZE OF THE DISHES AND PLAN T OI USE IT T ODAY FOR POWDERS AND NAIL ATR</li>
    <li> They are waaayyy smaller than I thought they would be. I was going to use them for my acrylic powder, but the stop are not stable they come off so easily, so now I&#x27;m trying to think of some other way they might be useful to me.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I purchased these to make my manicure table complete. I never would have expected them to be so amazing. When I received them I was so surprised. I thought that the low price would mean a low quality product. I was wrong! They are so cute and I get compliments on them!</li>
    <li> What i don&#x27;t like about them is that i did not get what was advertised.  I wanted what a saw in the picture, but instead i got two small jars with lids that serve it&#x27;s purpose but not very cute.  I liked the fact that the two little jars in the pic got tiny lids on top with a little round handle to lift them up better with.  but the ones i received had no such thing, since they didn&#x27;t cost must i let it go and kept them.</li>
    <li> Nice  2 pc crystal dappen dish for your nail art or your acrylic nails.Very small and cute big enough for your powder and liquid</li>
    <li> Works great I use it alot at first I thought it was to small but its actually perfect for me</li>
    <li> They are Exactly the size of the picture online.  I use it for one set of nails. I like the lid so I can cover the liquid after I am done and the powder.</li>
    <li> These are super tiny. Idk I guess you could use them for a one time use I guess. You get what you pay for</li>
    <li> The dishes are quite nice but a bit too small for my liking. One has a really dark blemish at the bottom, but not a problem as it does not affect how the dish is used. All in all they are an excellent deal for the price.</li>
    <li> item got here broken from the top ball. nothing a little glue couldn&#x27;t fix. other than the broken part decent item worth the price</li>
    <li> They were alot smaller then the picture</li>
    <li> This is a bad quality items and did not look like in the images. I bough 4 pairs of it, but they shipped to me all broken pieces and different shapes. All I can say is horrible! Do not take any star for these. Zero star!</li>
    <li> These are super cute and I will be ordering more. I originally bought for nail powder but when they came I thought to use to hold other little items.</li>
    <li> Very nice.Pretty enough to use for lots of other things! Crystal like, could be used as a little salt dish for company</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a little but bigger dishes. They were way to tiny it can&#x27;t not hold anything.</li>
    <li> omg, they are so small... Really not what I expected. but hey for the price I guess is really not that bad, but it took forever to get here..</li>
    <li> I was so skeptical about ordering these dishes after reading reviews, but after waiting for them not even as long as stated either, i am satisfied. There are 2 small glass dappen dishes with lids that serve its purpose. They are tiny, but work perfect for me. Thanks</li>
    <li> These are perfect for keeping acrylic powder.  They&#x27;re cute and pretty.  I keep powder in one and the empty one for my rings while I do my nails so they don&#x27;t get lost.</li>
    <li> Quality is not good, received both with a lot of scratches which makes it less beautiful to look at than the picture posted.  Too small as well.</li>
    <li> So glad I bought these. I read the other reviews, and was hesitate to purchase, I am so glad I did. They are beautiful and simply perfect, and for the price, I feel like I should have paid well over $30.</li>
    <li> I hot something different to what was advertised. Besides that they have different shape, they are too small and can&#x27;t do nothing with them.</li>
    <li> Love these dishes. They are small but they hold just enough for each client. Reduces waste!</li>
    <li> they are so cute,  the other ones i have they  don&#x27;t have a lid. i love them they are  perfect to do my acrylic nails.</li>
    <li> I did not get what is advertised here.. I got two tiny heart shaped containers with lids that barely fit! Im disappointed because I was expecting what is here in the picture.</li>
    <li> Tiny in size, I can only use it to hold acetone for clean up., too small for holding liquid and powder</li>
    <li> These dishes are so cute! I got exactly what was advertised here. Packaging was well protected. These dishes are perfect for acrylic liquid and powder. Also received a few days before the shipment date. Love them!</li>
    <li> Gorgeous came early was small but perfect for at home nails looks exactly like the picture, Will definitely order more if need be.</li>
    <li> The glass looks big and when I got it, it was soooo tiny. Like, really? Am I suppose to add three drips of acrylic liquid in that tiny glass? I regret buying it.</li>
    <li> For a dappen dish, the size is actually perfect! Arrived in perfect condition. The boxes were a little bumped, but the product inside was impeccable. Will post pictures for approximate size.</li>
    <li> Its Wasn&#x27;t What I Expected There To Small</li>
    <li> Came in the correct form - nothing was broken or chipped! Lids fit nice, too. These are also extremely adorable, lol.</li>
    <li> I just got these dish and I am impressed, they are larger than I expected, they are bigger than the dappen dish I currently use, these are octagon shape with the covers that have the knob on top, the covers/lids fit fine. I&#x27;m glad I purchased these.</li>
    <li> I purchase this product on 2/25 and it came in the mail 3/20 which it came one day before its delivery date. But however the dishes is so small the size of a 3 liter lid but a little bit smaller and depth its maybe a little less then 1 inch. I will not be purchasing this item for my company.</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected but super cute. They will work fine for doing acrylic nails.</li>
    <li> They arrived way ahead of time scheduled.  they are small  crystal like bowls with lids, but hold just the right amount of monomer for doing a set of nails.  it eliminates waist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only down side are the lids, they don&#x27;t fit snugly but I don&#x27;t mind because as i said it held just enough product. I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend to anyone looking for something personal.</li>
    <li> A little small. Doesn&#x27;t give much room or hold a lot. Arrived good, just need something bigger. I like the lids.</li>
    <li> This picture is not what I received. I got to little heart shaped ones. If I wanted that, I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered this. I don&#x27;t like being decieved</li>
    <li> When my jars arrived they were both broken. One is shattered and the other just the lid is broken. I am very disappointed, I was so excited to use these at my salon.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty but way too mini and shallow for holding liquid powder or dipping a brush for the price purchased.</li>
    <li> Great quality  - Made out of glass which is what I love. It&#x27;s great for home use as the items are small. Fast shipment and great customer service.</li>
    <li> They came in earlier than I expected, not only are they amazing for acrylic liquid and monomer, they&#x27;re also great for water marble nails. Im incredibly happy and highly recommend this product for others :)</li>
    <li> Is beautiful is good.</li>
    <li> first of all dis is relly gud items n it is so cute, n relly gudddd, omg it is just for keep ti ass a keeper n not for use it it is relly delicate n beutifull</li>
    <li> It was a great product, so I thought until it was shattered in the package . Waited too long to send back for another, so I threw it away</li>
    <li> great item for monomer and acetone</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly as I ordered and I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase. But one of the jar lids came broken :( hopefully some glue will fix it but other than that I&#x27;m happy</li>
    <li> I like how it has a lid. I do nails so the liquid i use is a little stong and i dont smell it as much whenccovered</li>
    <li> This product is very small and the first time I went to use  it, glass bottom fell as part from the rest of the jar.  Very poorly made I do not recommend this product to any one.  I requested a refund  and got refunded 2days later.</li>
    <li> The dishes are really like in the pic, but they are very small if you use a heavy brush it would tip it over</li>
    <li> Thought they would be bigger</li>
    <li> These work really well for caustic liquids</li>
    <li> did not know it was so tiny but thankyou</li>
    <li> one came broken and the other was complete but exactly alike they were suppose to be different in base and both intact</li>
    <li> These are nice, however the little ball was broken on one of the tops, haven&#x27;t glued it back on yet but I like the set.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price! Shipping was reasonable. would buy again.</li>
    <li> Lids are a little loose</li>
    <li> would have been better but one of the glass container was broken. other than that I like this product very much.</li>
    <li> This items work great . I recommend this product to any one that needs it. Very in expense product to purchase.</li>
    <li> Received these yesterday and they are super cute. I got what is exactly in the picture. They are very small but that is okay since I only do my nails as of right now.</li>
    <li> So cute ! But wish it would stay closed.</li>
    <li> Came broken and is smaller than pictured.</li>
    <li> They are alright! they don&#x27;t look the same as the picture, mine are square, but still work. Just unexpected! One of mine was also cracked, but it doesn&#x27;t leak(:</li>
    <li> After waiting so long for this delivery both of the crystal Dappen Dish are very cute but  the same and not like the picture shows.</li>
    <li> there very small and cute., got her today 4/6/15 was gonna get her Apr.20-May.5.2015 .,, ordered March.25.15</li>
    <li> worst product ever I bought these for my liquid and powder for My acrylic,  these things came broken... I understand there  cheap but at least you guys could have put it in something that the little glass ball that&#x27;s on top they came broken and I had to glue it together give it to my 2 year old daughter so she can put in her little small earrings because there so small they&#x27;re not worth buying...</li>
    <li> This two pcs dappen dishes are too small but work for what I want. They are ok for the price.</li>
    <li> i like this, its cute small but it can do what it should do came in the mail. one thing i didn&#x27;t like is that it came in a small little box nothing to protect it from getting broke. but sides the long wait on getting it when i got it i loved it i would get this again.&lt;br /&gt;if you want something small and cute and only doing it for your nails get it its worth it !</li>
    <li> I waited a long time for these to arrive in the mail. When they did get here they were both broken. So was a waste of money and time. I wrote to seller and told them they were both broken. And I was totally ignored. So good luck to anyone who buys these. Ha! Waste of my money for sure.</li>
    <li> Came broken but other wise cute</li>
    <li> Im not too happy with this product right now for the simple fact that when I received it, it was broke... which SUCKS! I think that its cute and really pretty...</li>
    <li> MY PRODUCT LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THIS AT ALLL!! HIGHLY HIGHLY UPSET,PLUS I CAN BARELY HOLD ACRYLIC OR LIQUID IN THESE DOLL SIZE HEXAGON CONTAINERS. MAD</li>
    <li> I imagined the product to be bigger and both circles instead they&#x27;re super tiny and one was a heart and the other a circle now I have mismatched products..  but shipping was quite strenuous as well. Once they get that under control they&#x27;ll be great!</li>
    <li> These litle dappen dishes look cute and cheap i order them, when i got them the wrapping was not well done and the lids on the dappen dishes dont fit!!! Am dissapoined</li>
    <li> I thought they we bigger but did the job I bought them for.  Wish they were bigger, not what I really wanted them,  so not using them..</li>
    <li> They work great but really small! How much product do u need at one time. Wish it was a little bigger.</li>
    <li> very, very,  very little dishes........ wouldn&#x27;t buy.... to small to use....I use it to mix my beads....theses are not good dishes...</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY!!!! Way to small!!!! NOT WHAT I PAYED FOR FALSE ADVERTISING!!! YOUD BE VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!! Honest review here</li>
    <li> These obviously do what they&#x27;re supposed to but when they arrived on one of them the little handle was broken off I had to super glue it and also they are way smaller then I thought they were gonna be but like I said they are still gonna work fine for acrylics I&#x27;m happy they have a lid since acrylic monomer is so strong smelling but it was cheap so I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought. But work great!!</li>
    <li> I thought these were bigger. They are very tiny. But cute</li>
    <li> I like them they are little like u would get in a acrylic starter kit a bit bigger mine are similar to pic round. but were dirty in inside like they been used or never cleaned after made not sure which, i did except bigger but work for me. Oh one of the balls were broke off to.. but i used my brush on nail glue and it held the glass ball on immediately i was amazed i have awesome glue lol!!!</li>
    <li> I have received this item chipped and damaged the packaging was horrible very disappointed next time you should package it better and maybe it wont break</li>
    <li> These are to cute and great for nail products</li>
    <li> I like this for my liquid acrylic. It is small in size, but okay for home use.  The lid doesn&#x27;t fit well, it&#x27;s very loose. Still it serves its purpose and is very cute.</li>
    <li> I though I would receive one round and one hexagon shaped dish. Received both hexagon shapes. Would browse around for a different product next time.</li>
    <li> Very nice buy one of the them broke from the lid, I think every time they send this kidd of things should write on it fragil, cus it was in a simple bubble bag...</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for french manicures and she loves it. Holds the nail polish remover as expected. Great dish.</li>
    <li> they are so cute and perfect for a quick fill so you dont waste your liquid and just adorable</li>
    <li> Not what I expected; they appear larger and better quality in picture. Will use them eventually, but would have preferred a larger size.</li>
    <li> I received this product so late that I forgot I even purchased it. And they arrived broken.</li>
    <li> The dappen dishes are pretty. They are much smaller than I would&#x27;ve liked, but they are beautiful. The glass is beautiful.</li>
    <li> I chose two stars out of five because the product is very cute and nice and small, just as I wanted. The picture shown on the product is what I got, except for the fact that the packaging WAS ABSOLUTELY NOT as secure as it could have been. One of my jars was completely broken. Smashed to pieces. The second jar was in a 3 out of 5 condition. The ball on the top had came off and the lid was chipped. I am okay with using just the one jar that is in a somewhat good condition, as I am just using it for home use but if I were ordering this product for business use.. I would not order it again.</li>
    <li> Great little dishes for acrylic liquid or powder.&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased with my purchase and the price was great!</li>
    <li> Absolutely great. These bowls are so pretty and I want to thank the company for making it right. My first bowls came a little crushed and the company immediately sent me out newer, better bowls. Thank you, these really make me happy.</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected</li>
    <li> Size should be listed. They can hardly hold anything at all</li>
    <li> Took a bit to get to me but I got them!</li>
    <li> Perfect, cant wait to use.</li>
    <li> Use these die my bettas food.</li>
    <li> They are square,  but I like that!</li>
    <li> It took 2 months to receive them and they showed up broken .they are poorly made the lids dont fit which defeats the purpose of using them so ur liquid dosent evaporate  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying these and the customer service is horrible! !</li>
