      <li>Great job Beauty 4 You!</li>
      <li>Have tried a number of wave caps and durags and this is the best one.</li>
      <li>The IDEAL wave cap.</li>
      <li>The product itself works great.</li>
      <li>I like it fits awesome and is very comfortable</li>
      <li>It has spandex around the edges and the panty hose material on top, this is the perfect design to create waves!</li>
      <li>Bought the training wave caps for my son and he was very satisfied with the out come.&lt;br</li>
      <li>You is even better!</li>
      <li>It is more comfortable but it isn&#x27;t as a good as a durag if you want waves.</li>
      <li>Nice, thicker bottom layer for grip and fit and nice stalking layer up top for hair and breathability.</li>
      <li>This cap is very cheap.  </li>
      <li>the picture on the package  if NOT  what you get  very cheap</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very cheap material.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>Something about the stocking cap material on top also seems to provides better compression than a durag.</li>
      <li>i like it better that a wave cap (the one that ties around your head)</li>
      <li>because fast delivery, perfect fit, i would recommend it to those trying to get wave only problem is it looks nothing like the</li>
      <li>It just looks funny and it wears out faster then most wave caps.</li>
      <li>:) looks good and is not too tight either .the falling off when i sleep</li>
      <li>Better off with an old stocking cap.</li>
      <li>Provides deep nice uniformed waves.</li>
      <li>It looks good fits tight but comfortable much better than a regular wave cap.</li>
      <li>I have many other caps but this one works those hard areas the best.</li>
      <li>You was nice enough to quickly send me new one.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t have the same form fitting capabilities as a durag.</li>
      <li>Regular wave caps tend to bunch up at the top and come off at night for me.</li>
      <li>I would definitely buy more items from this seller again and would highly recommend them to anyone interested in buying their products.</li>
      <li>I liked wearing this cap when I&#x27;m out to keep my waves pressed down</li>
      <li>your better off buying a high end stocking and cunning it up ...</li>
      <li>I have been using it for over a week now, and the results are very noticeable.</li>
      <li>There are no complaints there, it really does what it says it will.</li>
      <li>I ordered this for my husband as he is into his waves and wants them to continue to evolve on his waves.  </li>
      <li>it really is just a stocking atleast</li>
      <li>I really thought that this would stay in place while I slept.</li>
      <li>,that is the only reason ,other than that it was really good ,stays on (while awake)</li>
      <li>so maybe I&#x27;m stretching it a bit more than the average.</li>
      <li>But it is cheap the top part began to rip in only a few days now</li>
      <li>i chose this ratinge mainly because the cap would fall of when i sleep .I</li>
      <li>This wave cap had free shipping when I bought it, the 4.99 shipping is a bit absurd because this item is light enough to ship for free.</li>
      <li>I needed the most work on the sides and bottom part to lay it down properly.</li>
      <li>The fit was too tight and the cap rolled off.</li>
      <li>I only use it for double compression (putting it on top of my other wave cap).  </li>
      <li>Bottom grip portion is not glossy JET black as pictured but more matte blue-ish black.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave marks on forehead or give headaches like a tight durag can for optimal compression &amp; stays on much better at night than a typical wave cap.</li>
      <li>Not meant for women&#x27;s short natural.</li>
      <li>Comes apart not long after having it.  </li>

    <li> The product itself works great. I have been using it for over a week now, and the results are very noticeable. There are no complaints there, it really does what it says it will. The customer service you get from Beauty 4 You is even better! There was a problem with the item I ordered while it was on transit, but Beauty 4 You was nice enough to quickly send me new one. Thank you Beauty 4 You! I would definitely buy more items from this seller again and would highly recommend them to anyone interested in buying their products. Great job Beauty 4 You!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this just buy a stocking and make it your self</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the same form fitting capabilities as a durag. It is more comfortable but it isn&#x27;t as a good as a durag if you want waves.</li>
    <li> Trash!!!! Save your money people</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very cheap material.  Comes apart not long after having it.  I only use it for double compression (putting it on top of my other wave cap).  It does leave a line.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> i use this to head to the gym. fits a little too snug but i have a big head and i have locs.</li>
    <li> I got this for my BF and he loves it. It has spandex around the edges and the panty hose material on top, this is the perfect design to create waves! It leaves a mark around the forhead when removed, but goes away after about 30 minutes.</li>
    <li> Better off with an old stocking cap. This one does not hold tight.</li>
    <li> Have tried a number of wave caps and durags and this is the best one. Doesn&#x27;t leave marks on forehead or give headaches like a tight durag can for optimal compression &amp; stays on much better at night than a typical wave cap. Regular wave caps tend to bunch up at the top and come off at night for me. Something about the stocking cap material on top also seems to provides better compression than a durag. Will eventually start to stretch, but just throw it in the dryer (after washing) to tighten it up again. P.S. Can be found cheaper elsewhere on the net.    [...]</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband as he is into his waves and wants them to continue to evolve on his waves.  So I decided to try this quote on quote wave trainer for him.... And after one day of use, his response was that it was &amp;#34;Garbage&amp;#34;!!!</li>
    <li> Not meant for women&#x27;s short natural. I really thought that this would stay in place while I slept. Nope! The fit was too tight and the cap rolled off. I also got a headache.</li>
    <li> The IDEAL wave cap. Durability could last longer but I have a big head so maybe I&#x27;m stretching it a bit more than the average. Nice, thicker bottom layer for grip and fit and nice stalking layer up top for hair and breathability. Bottom grip portion is not glossy JET black as pictured but more matte blue-ish black.</li>
    <li> Bought the training wave caps for my son and he was very satisfied with the out come.&lt;br /&gt;He refuses to use anything else. Provides deep nice uniformed waves.</li>
    <li> This wave cap does not leave a mark. It is not too tight either, I wear it over my ears and behind, it does irritate my ears a little when put over them. This wave cap had free shipping when I bought it, the 4.99 shipping is a bit absurd because this item is light enough to ship for free.</li>
    <li> I like it fits awesome and is very comfortable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 star because fast delivery, perfect fit, i would recommend it to those trying to get wave only problem is it looks nothing like the what&#x27;s on the package. it really is just a stocking atleast that&#x27;s what i received.</li>
    <li> the picture on the package  if NOT  what you get  very cheap your better off buying a high end stocking and cunning it up ... this is trash dont buy it wish i can get my money back</li>
    <li> I liked wearing this cap when I&#x27;m out to keep my waves pressed down It looks good fits tight but comfortable much better than a regular wave cap. But it is cheap the top part began to rip in only a few days now it has holes all over and is useless. I would buy another if they would make then stronger.</li>
    <li> This cap is not all that.  It well and doesn&#x27;t slide or move around when your sleeping. It just looks funny and it wears out faster then most wave caps.</li>
    <li> It just another durag. The only problem about this is that it dries out your hair.</li>
    <li> i chose this ratinge mainly because the cap would fall of when i sleep .I would wake up and it would be under the bed somewhere ,that is the only reason ,other than that it was really good ,stays on (while awake) :) looks good and is not too tight either .the falling off when i sleep could be due to the fact that i sleep terribly .but that aside i like it better that a wave cap (the one that ties around your head)</li>
    <li> This cap is very cheap.  Mine had runs in it within a few nights.  Not impressed.  Look at their \\&quot;athletic\\&quot; models instead of this one.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it. It helped in the areas were I needed the most work on the sides and bottom part to lay it down properly. I have many other caps but this one works those hard areas the best. I recommend these to anyone.</li>
