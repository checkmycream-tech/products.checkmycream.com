      <li>This flat iron is amazing!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used plenty of flat irons and this is by far the best!</li>
      <li>Nothing special here.</li>
      <li>I am a professional hairstylist and I found this product very easy to use and the results were fantastic.  </li>
      <li>so the guard gives me some piece of mind when I leave the iron to cool off.</li>
      <li>My wife needed a good quality of flat iron like the ones used in a saloon</li>
      <li>(This means a lot because my hair is usually super frizzy and wavy).</li>
      <li>It heats up quickly.  </li>
      <li>The Heiz heats up super quick and when I&#x27;m done all I have to do is unplug and place</li>
      <li>Only downfall is you can adjust the heat but definately straightens amazing.</li>
      <li>It slides through her hair smoothly and leaves the hair shiney and straight.  </li>
      <li>It was well worth the price I paid.</li>
      <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t catch or smoke and the end result is soft, smooth hair!</li>
      <li>The only difference between this model and the $120 versions that I used to own is that they heat up faster - within 20 seconds.</li>
      <li>What I like most about this item is that it leaves my hair shiny and soft.</li>
      <li>It worth to buy .</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair nice and soft but I probably would have been better off buying the brand I had been using for the last 7 years.</li>
      <li>It just arrived, right on time like promised.  </li>
      <li>The iron heats up well and right away.</li>
      <li>I received this right on time, with everything offered.</li>
      <li>I don’t usually order products online, but I am happy I did this time.</li>
      <li>I have super straight hair and it won’t hold a curl to save my life</li>
      <li>It heats up very fast.</li>
      <li>Works great on my thick wavy hair.</li>
      <li>I know, it&#x27;s an iron, it&#x27;s supposed to be hot</li>
      <li>I received this about a month ago and it&#x27;s still working just as well as it did the first day.</li>
      <li>I was able to get used to using it in a very short time.  </li>
      <li>Much higher quality than the $10 to $20 ones.</li>
      <li>This product worked exactly what said it was supposed do be.</li>
      <li>Never heard of this brand but just got it the other day tried it and love it!</li>
      <li>The reason I give the iron 4 stars instead of 5 is because it gets REALLY hot.</li>
      <li>and it works pretty well that way, too.</li>
      <li>On this iron, there&#x27;s no way to adjust temperature, but it seems quite hot.</li>
      <li>but, it is much hotter than my old straightener which worked just fine to straighten my hair at the lower temperature</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so pleased that I chose the Heiz Flat Iron.</li>
      <li>I posted a video review to show how much I enjoyed using this flat iron.</li>
      <li>I love this hair flat iron and would 100% recommend it!</li>
      <li>I also love the swivel cord, so much easier to deal with when you don&#x27;t have to unwind the cord constantly.</li>
      <li>It came in a beautiful black and pink box and had heat pouch and glove which seems pretty and useful.</li>
      <li>The first time I started to straighten my hair, it was doing just as much as my $15 straightener.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using since for almost 3 weeks now without any problems. It does a great job of straightening. And I like to use it to curl my hair too and it works pretty well that way, too. My hair stays so smooth and it seems to add some shine. And the customer service was amazing. I contacted them because of my wrong order, they were really nice, I‘ve never experienced company with better service ever. Even I’m not the prime, delivery was fast too. I was satisfied with all of things.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:f8e3ad5d9b17dc7be9aeb0305e7bc56f]] I posted a video review to show how much I enjoyed using this flat iron. The Heiz flat iron comes with a heat resistant cap and a black travel pouch that also works as a place mat for the iron. The iron is ready to use within 30 seconds and does a great job straightening or curling my hair. What I like most about this item is that it leaves my hair shiny and soft. I hope this video shows you why I like this affordable flat iron so much.</li>
    <li> I have used my Heiz hair straightener for about 2 weeks now. If you are looking for a flat iron that works like any other expensive flat iron (ex. Chi, Paul brown etc) Don’t look further. This Heiz hair straightener is FANTASTIC! Works great on my thick wavy hair. The iron heats up well and right away. I had the Chi flat iron for 5 years and it never heated up as hot as this flat iron. It makes my hair silky and soft and takes away the frizziness. For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this straightener. Why do you spend hundreds of dollars when you can give this a try? You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron because it was on sale. If it had been listed for anything near the $99.99 retail price, I wouldn&#x27;t have gotten it - but it&#x27;s a bargain at $35 or less. I have thick dark hair with a slight natural wave, and it does take a fair amount of heat to get it to do what I want. On adjustable irons, I usually end up using a setting near the top. On this iron, there&#x27;s no way to adjust temperature, but it seems quite hot. It&#x27;s hot enough to work on my hair, anyway. If your hair is thin and delicate and it burns easily, I would recommend using a different iron where you can adjust the temperature and use the absolute minimum you need for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may still end up buying a nicer flat iron in the future, but I&#x27;m traveling a lot this summer and this thing is going to take a beating. I love that it comes with a pouch/mat, too. That should come in handy when checking out of hotel rooms in a hurry.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron after my previous one had broken( I have used a CHI for about 5 years or so). After looking around the Amazon and reading the reviews, this was the straightener I chose to get. There are some negative reviews, but still there were enough higher ratings to choose this product. This straightener delivered really pleasing in the appearance. It came in a beautiful black and pink box and had heat pouch and glove which seems pretty and useful. This HEIZ has replaced my CHI and has exceeded all of my expectations. It doesn’t burn my hair at all or pull them out, and left soft and shiny after use. I received this about a month ago and it&#x27;s still working just as well as it did the first day. I absolutely love this straightener and am so happy that my CHI broken, because if it didn&#x27;t I wouldn&#x27;t have ever taken a chance and discovered this amazing product. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! At first I was a little worried; so I did my research and went for it.(Reviews were helping for me to end up with this product) This product worked exactly what said it was supposed do be. The flat iron was delivered to my home in a time, brand NEW Package!!. It heats up very quickly and gets my hair straighter than I&#x27;ve ever had it. My hair is also very hard to tame. Once I was done with flat ironing my hair, I was extremely pleased to notice smooth passes left my hair shiny and soft. Afterward, my hair still remained almost as if my hair were naturally straight. I have never had bad experience with this flat iron like pulling and catching feeling that I used to have for other flat irons. Overall, this is a great product. I don’t usually order products online, but I am happy I did this time.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is amazing! I&#x27;ve used plenty of flat irons and this is by far the best! I think the best part is the movable penal that never pulls your hair makes kinda hurts. And also can make some wavy curls more easily with this iron. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good ceramic straighter and I will purchase again if needed. Heats up fast, perfect size, prompt shipment!</li>
    <li> The first time I started to straighten my hair, it was doing just as much as my $15 straightener. Then I tried to curl my hair with it and oh my gosh! Amazing curls that lasted!! I curled my hair sometimes and it performed so well. The next day I straightened my hair and went to Six flags (which when I go, my hair usually frizzes up in about an hour) but surprisingly, it lasted all day! no frizz, no waves! A couple days later, I tried to straighten my hair again and it was amazing! My sister was even like &amp;#34;Your hair looks so good!&amp;#34; (This means a lot because my hair is usually super frizzy and wavy). I love this hair flat iron and would 100% recommend it!</li>
    <li> Excellent straightener! Girlfriend loves it. Much higher quality than the $10 to $20 ones.</li>
    <li> I have used several different flat irons over the years and consider myself a little bit of an expert. I was a little skeptical when I first ordered this one, since it was a little bit on the cheaper side. After using it for a couple of months, I have to say that this is one of the best flat irons I have ever had. As I have very thick, medium long hair, it usually takes a long time to get it done. BUT, it doesn&#x27;t take me long to straighten it at all. I also used it to curl my hair which works out well. It heats up very fast. It is better than I expected!!</li>
    <li> I am a professional hairstylist and I found this product very easy to use and the results were fantastic.  I was able to get used to using it in a very short time.  I would recommend this product to someone who has a hard time using styling aids.</li>
    <li> The product was delivered within an expected date and arrived in excellent condition (The package looks so nice and lovely). It came with protective guard cap and pouch mat that were kind of a pleasant surprise for me because I didn’t expect this. I hadn&#x27;t heard of this brand before but based upon the results so far, I would absolutely buy it again. I have naturally curly hair that can sometimes be hard to tame but this flat iron leaves my hair smooth and shiny. With previous flat irons, I&#x27;ve had some issues with my hair getting caught in the hinge but so far I haven&#x27;t had any unexpectedly pulled hair. I was just hoping to replace an old flat iron that stopped working and now I ended up getting a fantastic one. I recommend this flat iron, and it is a perfect package as gifts.</li>
    <li> I decided to replace my old flat iron with a Ceramic one from Heiz here and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. This one heats up in record time , about 30 seconds or so , and it works great!  Curling  , styling , straightening , it does it all very well.  When I&#x27;m working on hair , I dont feel it pull or catch anyone&#x27;s hair and its getting tons of its own reviews every time I use it on someone&#x27;s hair!  This one is a winner for sure and you can&#x27;t beat the price as its definitely competitive with others that you&#x27;ll find for almost double the price!&lt;br /&gt;A+ from me!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve paid more for flat irons, but this is the best I&#x27;ve found.  I have used it for curling and straightening.  Got through both in minimum time.  Styling my hair is a hobby for me, so I do a lot of it.  This iron leaves my hair smooth and shiny.  Take a look at my pictures.</li>
    <li> I have used a couple of hair straighteners before that have gotten the job done, but this one really beats them all for the price and quality. My last one would pull my hair and I would have to rip it out occasionally, but this one straightened with a smoothness that I have never felt before. It left my hair amazingly soft and I could see a big difference in how long the hair remained straight. Even though I have only owned it for one week, I have to say I love it, hopefully it will last a long time. Also, I used it to curl one clump of hair and I was surprised to see that the curl was very beautiful. This is a great hair straightener and is better than many of others expensive and popular brands. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so pleased that I chose the Heiz Flat Iron. It&#x27;s not only a high end product at a great price, it&#x27;s 1&amp;#34; ceramic plates are perfect for short to medium length hair. The Heiz heats up super quick and when I&#x27;m done all I have to do is unplug and place it&#x27;s heat proof plastic cover over the wand to hold the plates together, then wrap it in the protective cover for storing away without having to leave the flat iron out to cool.</li>
    <li> I have bought all types of flat irons from the cheapest to the CHI. After trying this one, I will never buy another brand again. It&#x27;s one of the best straighteners I&#x27;ve ever purchased with this price. I have curly/wavy/mind-of-its-own hair that most straighteners don&#x27;t even touch half the time, but this one gets the job done. I received this right on time, with everything offered. It is not only straighten my hair very well, but it leaves it soft afterwards. The best thing is that it does such a great job, I only have to hold each piece of hair once. I don&#x27;t need to go over and over again. Thanks for making the best flat iron!!</li>
    <li> Only bad thing is my hand has gotten pinched in the handle several times while styling my hair!!!</li>
    <li> It works well but not the best</li>
    <li> I bought this Heiz flat iron after my previous straightening iron (which was twice expensive than this one) stopped working all of a sudden after just three months.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this one around five times so far . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Heats up quickly&lt;br /&gt;Straightens hair with one pass and curl my hair softly&lt;br /&gt;Hair is shiny and not frizzy&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Well, it&#x27;s just been a week so we&#x27;ll see how long it lasts without any issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used $25 straighteners and $120 straighteners on my medium thickness, wavy hair. This one leaves my hair shinier and smoother than the $20 version ever did. The only difference between this model and the $120 versions that I used to own is that they heat up faster - within 20 seconds. But, I am completely okay with waiting more seconds for it to heat up.</li>
    <li> Heat very fast, it has a very good quanlity. It worth to buy .</li>
    <li> My sister was looking for a hair straightening iron and I decided to gift this to her. She was impressed from the moment that I gifted this to her. It works very well and delivers effective results. I am happy with my purchase and would recommend this hair straighter to anyone.</li>
    <li> (Husband&#x27;s review) My wife needed a good quality of flat iron like the ones used in a saloon and I was about to spend some hefty amount over CHI. as her financier I stepped in to save my money from being wasted on those products. I am not saying they are bad quality but I believe that there are replacements available in the market from different manufacturers that provide the same or even better quality within reason. I searched and finally found this product. She has forgotten about her old CHI flat iron. She has curly hair and is able to straighten it very quickly and doesn&#x27;t have any frizz problem. I will definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> It just arrived, right on time like promised.  Love they stylish look and how the blades move....Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it yet but one thing I have already noticed that I do not like is that there is no temperature control so you&#x27;re basically stuck with one setting.....smh.  I&#x27;ll come back and update the review once I&#x27;ve used it. Maybe I&#x27;ll change my mind and give it a better review.  Update on 7/16/15......have used it a couple times.  Not a very smooth experience. Even though I section my hair it still seems to get caught as I&#x27;m pulling the iron through.  It leaves my hair nice and soft but I probably would have been better off buying the brand I had been using for the last 7 years.</li>
    <li> Nothing special here. Its a straightener like any other really. Don&#x27;t get me wrong its decent, but I feel like its very similar to my cheaper straightener that I already have. It has one setting, but that one setting gets good heat. I do like the fact that the iron has a cap and heating pad/ travel bag</li>
    <li> This hair straightener works very nicely-even though there&#x27;s just one heat setting.  My hair doesn&#x27;t catch or smoke and the end result is soft, smooth hair!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my fiancé after her&#x27;s died.  She absolutely loves it. Her words... It slides through her hair smoothly and leaves the hair shiney and straight.  Her hair doesn&#x27;t frizz.  It heats up quickly.  Glad she got this one.</li>
    <li> Perfect...tough to buy for wife but she loves it!💁</li>
    <li> Never heard of this brand but just got it the other day tried it and love it! Takes little time to straighten my hair!</li>
    <li> This straightener is amazing. Only downfall is you can adjust the heat but definately straightens amazing.</li>
    <li> I like the product.  It was well worth the price I paid.</li>
    <li> Great product at a good price.</li>
    <li> I have never had a full-size flat iron where the temperature cannot be adjusted. The manual doesn&#x27;t even state what the actual temperature is. I doubt it uses infrared technology as claimed in the Amazon description; I had another iron that had it and the results are very different. This flat iron is also poorly designed as it is easy to pinch fingers while using it.</li>
    <li> The unit has no temperature control and after 30 minutes of heating, it was not hot enough for my hair.  I usually use a setting just above the middle of the range of an iron, so I&#x27;m not looking for anything extreme.  Other issues - it was relatively easy to pinch my palm in the hinge. On the plus side, the two plates meet well but they are shorter than some irons that I have used.</li>
    <li> The straightener doesn&#x27;t even have heat controls to it and when I finished using it my hair looked all burnt. The pictures didn&#x27;t show the lack of controllers. I got it today and when I used it I was so disappointed. I&#x27;m definitely not ordering from this brand again!</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s old flat iron was suddenly broken after about two years and would not heat up high enough to effectively straighten her hair. While I am not an expert at flat irons, I did my research by reading the reviews here on amazon and decided to purchase this one for my wife as a gift. I have to say this product is good value for the money. She really liked it and told me it is decent hair straightener and it does a great job for her. She has had it for about 2 months now with no issues. I would recommend this as a gift.</li>
    <li> This ceramic hair straightener by Heiz is so great for a fraction of the cost of my old one. That swayed my decision plus seeing the pictures some of the girls posted and their hair looks so shiny and wonderful after using this straightener. I have super straight hair and it won’t hold a curl to save my life, I started using hair straighteners to curl my hair instead and even without hairspray it holds a curl for me (I like the messy loose curls) but if I want a tight curl or need it to last through an event then I do use hairspray for extra hold. The way it’s built too is to minimize your hair from being pulled or getting stuck in the corners of the straightener which I really like, especially with curling hair I would have that happen to me somewhat often and now it happens a lot less. I love that they give you a few extras like the heat clamp and the heat matt too so you have safe way and place to put it down. I’ve had a friend drop her straightener and then stumble and step on the open clamp, not a great day. So I definitely appreciate that.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST straightening iron EVER!!! I love it. It keeps my hair straight all day as where other irons last a few hours. So very happy I bought it!! I would def recommend!!!</li>
    <li> My husband bought me this to replace the Sharper Image straightener that I have had for years, and though it still works, it is falling apart. This straightener heats up very quickly. I am use to plugging my old one in and walking away from it for 10 minutes or more so that by the time I get back it is ready to use. This one, I can just turn it on, brush out my hair and it is ready to go. It glides over my hair easily and doesn&#x27;t pull at all. I love the plate protector that you put on after you turn off the iron. We have children and sometimes those little hands like to pull on things so the guard gives me some piece of mind when I leave the iron to cool off. I also love the swivel cord, so much easier to deal with when you don&#x27;t have to unwind the cord constantly. The reason I give the iron 4 stars instead of 5 is because it gets REALLY hot. I know, it&#x27;s an iron, it&#x27;s supposed to be hot but, it is much hotter than my old straightener which worked just fine to straighten my hair at the lower temperature so it makes me wonder how much more damage am I doing to my hair with this iron which seems drastically and unnecessarily hotter.</li>
