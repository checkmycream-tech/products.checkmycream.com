      <li>Natural matte finish.</li>

<li> Too hard to work with.</li>
<li> they have changed the product a tad since at least April 2015.</li>
<li> Seriously.</li>
<li> Greasy, doesn&#x27;t hold well, smells bad and makes my short non curly hair curl immediately after I put it in.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t mind the silly name.</li>
<li> 4 stars because it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
<li> I used TIGI Matte Paste for a while and that stuff was impossible to wash out.</li>
<li> When it was delivered the product was very cold</li>
<li> Very disappointed.  </li>

    <li> I love this product!  It has a strong hold without leaving my hair looking greasy.  I used to use American Crew Fiber and this is hands down a better product.  It has a stronger hold and leaves my hair with a more natural look.  I have straight, medium-fine hair and it works great when my hair is short to medium length.</li>
    <li> My husband and I had a hard time finding a good quality putty that did the job. My husband read about fatboy in GQ magazine, we bought it here on Amazon. Four months later we&#x27;ve finished the entire container. And we almost never finish hair products let alone like it enough to repurchase. However, we have found this putty to work, and we will be repeat purchasers. I like the smell, it never leaves hair crusty/crunchy and it helps to keep both of our hair do&#x27;s in place. Hope Amazon continues to sell it.</li>
    <li> If you have grey hair, Fatboy will exaggerate the greyness.</li>
    <li> I really exited to use this product but sadly it came to me with a very crash top.</li>
    <li> This product smells great, I have thick wavy hair and it does a great job holding my hair in place. It&#x27;s not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Holds great with a relaxed look. No oily slick hair</li>
    <li> Im so happy this is on Amazon now. The hold is great, easy to put in hair, and smells great. I used to use American Crew which had similar hold but was difficult putting in my hair. This one is so easy to use. The price is great, same as on the FatBoy website itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love this product and definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> When it was delivered the product was very cold so instead of a putty or pomade it was more like a thick solid. Not as creamy as I expected. It is VERY white when you put it on hair so you need to rub it in alot, smells fresh but isn&#x27;t too noticeable. Overall I thought it was OK but compared to other products it could have been better</li>
    <li> This is the only hair product I use.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed.  This product gives my hair a whitish/greyish look and I am naturally brown.  I ended up throwing it out.</li>
    <li> Great product! The smell mentioned goes away after you apply it, no big deal. Make sure you rub it through your hair evenly to prevent clumping. 4 stars because it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
    <li> This is the best non-greasy bed head hair product I have ever used (and I have normally greasy hair). Would recommend to anyone needing a little texture.</li>
    <li> Love the product, been re-ordering for quite a while. Matte look and nice hold although I use hairspray afterwards. NOTE: they have changed the product a tad since at least April 2015. It&#x27;s drier in my hands which doesn&#x27;t have any impact I&#x27;ve noticed, the bummer is that now it leaves white marks in my hair unless I use it carefully, none of my previous tubs ever did that...</li>
    <li> Makes my hair look white.  Otherwise it is a great product.  I love the hold and matt finish.</li>
    <li> Best hair product out there!</li>
    <li> Greasy, doesn&#x27;t hold well, smells bad and makes my short non curly hair curl immediately after I put it in. Terrible.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  Great hold lasts all day without being goopy.</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff. I spike my hair up and this is the best product I have ever used for this and I have used a lot of products. I am hooked. So glad to see that it was only recently offered on Amazon. This is a fantastic mens hair product. It has a clay texture but has a strong hold that will last all day. The greatest part is that it is easy to wash out of your hair. I used TIGI Matte Paste for a while and that stuff was impossible to wash out. FatBoy comes out in a breeze. Don&#x27;t mind the silly name. BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> So glad to be able to buy FATBOY online. I first started using this when I had my hair cut, very short,  in Dallas 3 years ago. I love the feel and softness this product gives my hair, but holds the style all day. the 2.2 oz lasted me a little over a year. Seriously. When I got home to far West Texas, I could not find FATBOY in any of our stores.&lt;br /&gt;I looked online and found that Amazon sold it several bucks less than most.</li>
    <li> Appliance is easy, smells good, easy to wash out, but i did think the hold would be stronger</li>
    <li> Too hard to work with.</li>
    <li> The hype is real. Have tried s Tom of different hair products and as soon as I made contact with this one I knew it was different. Goes on well. Works well. Stays well. Natural matte finish. Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
