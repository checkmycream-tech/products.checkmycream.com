      <li>It worked perfectly for me.</li>
      <li>Hey, it is as good as it gets!</li>
      <li>great product for temp fix</li>
      <li>Good</li>
      <li>Keeping in mind that these zinc oxide/calcium sulphate mixes are temporary, I am delighted with the result.</li>
      <li>good product for hiking and emergency use</li>
      <li>It takes a day or two to get in to see most dentists.</li>
      <li>dentist wanted $14,000 to do my teeth and most of them don&#x27;t need work</li>
      <li>and I made sure everything was done correctly,</li>
      <li>I tried in many times, read and followed the instructions closely, including using a waterpik before application and making sure it was moist, etc.  </li>
      <li>, I had better luck using Super glue!</li>
      <li>After my meal it had disappeared, so it had come off quite easily.</li>
      <li>I see it now available on *bay</li>
      <li>From what I have read DenTek changed the formulation which explains how what was originally a five star product got turned into a one star one.</li>
      <li>When I used the original version of this product it lasted two weeks</li>
      <li>I am waiting for my next trip to Lebanon so I can pay about $1,500 for a full mouth - GOOD work without insurance percentage even.</li>
      <li>It has some sticking ability when you first use it, but that is as strong as it gets.    </li>
      <li>Needed a quick fix.    </li>
      <li>, you warm it in water and it goes soft like chewing gum, you push it into the hole and then as soon as it cools (which is pretty much immediately)</li>
      <li>No matter how much you clean the crown or anything else, it does not work.</li>
      <li>If you are really careful, following directions perfectly, and can go a day without food or using your mouth, it will become slightly more solid, but it still will not stick to anything.  </li>
      <li>All 6 applications were still soft and crumbly, and they all would easily smear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This stuff is really great as long as you use it properly.</li>
      <li>but he wants to do them!</li>
      <li>The first time you eat something will cause the filling to just smear</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t eat anything for or drink anything hot for 2-3 hours though.  </li>
      <li>That way it is good and hard.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;ll lose too much money.</li>
      <li>It was absolute garbage.</li>
      <li>This stuff really did not work well at all.  </li>
      <li>that has the real thing the dentist use</li>
      <li>+ Area to be filled MUST be WET.</li>
      <li>It never really solidified, and the more it did, the more crumbly it became because it had a very inconsistent texture, like a cross between dried gum and Play-doh.  </li>
      <li>Do not waste your money on this.</li>
      <li>DON&#x27;T EAT right after you apply it, or you will mess it all up.</li>
      <li>This sounded like serious stuff, like you really had to do it right because the dentist is going to have to remove it.  </li>
      <li>I am a medical professional although not a dentist</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a professional grade and very solid.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;Maximum Hold\\&quot; Are you kidding me?I followed everything carefully and this thing will get eaten and melt in the mouth without much</li>
      <li>It goes on just like typical putty or spackling compound, and just like spackling, it will dissolve and crumple in too much water.    </li>

<li> They really must have changed it, DENTEK Temparin Max is a soft putty and it just doesn&#x27;t seem to get hard so it doesn&#x27;t take long to wear off, couple of hours max.</li>

<li> My single application held for 3-1/2 weeks.</li>
<li> One filling last about 2 weeks depends on what hard food i eat like chips and such.</li>
<li> + Try to shape the filling so that it bears minimal weight.  </li>
<li> + Use wet finger and wet cotton swab to shape material.  </li>
<li> This was a big waste of a LOT of money.</li>
<li> Wouldn&#x27;t last past a few hours.  </li>
<li> Reading the label, I was a little nervous.  </li>
<li> The negative Temparin reviews may be due to insufficient instructions.</li>

<li> Failed each time, total rip-off at any price.  </li>
<li> The package led me to believe it would stay in place for a day or two at least.  </li>
<li> It has to set for at least two to three hours before you eat.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed that big name Dentek makes this junk.  Even after carefully following the printed directions five times, it still wouldn&#x27;t stay in place for very long.  This stuff crumbles and falls out when I eat. The package led me to believe it would stay in place for a day or two at least.  It takes a day or two to get in to see most dentists.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d try it since it said \\&quot;Maximum Hold\\&quot; Are you kidding me?I followed everything carefully and this thing will get eaten and melt in the mouth without much pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did you know that the 1 OZ of this exceeds $300? I researched and found out it&#x27;s politics so the dental whales can keep sucking people&#x27;s blood and get richer and this is why this is NOT allowed to be any stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going with one from outside USA that has the real thing the dentist use and it&#x27;s cheaper than this. it has the permanent glassy style thing that you can mix yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist wanted $14,000 to do my teeth and most of them don&#x27;t need work but he wants to do them! I am waiting for my next trip to Lebanon so I can pay about $1,500 for a full mouth - GOOD work without insurance percentage even. Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S POLITICS AND CAPITALISM that&#x27;s why they don&#x27;t work. 1 OZ for $300 and is garbage &#x3D; Come to me the dentist to rip you off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE***** The stuff I got from the UK is called Denseal. It worked perfectly for me. It&#x27;s a professional grade and very solid. I see it now available on *bay but it still ships from UK. I wish they&#x27;d pay me for telling you this. :-/</li>
    <li> When I used the original version of this product it lasted two weeks but this version doesn&#x27;t last even a day.  From what I have read DenTek changed the formulation which explains how what was originally a five star product got turned into a one star one.</li>
    <li> This stuff really did not work well at all.  Wouldn&#x27;t last past a few hours.  I tried in many times, read and followed the instructions closely, including using a waterpik before application and making sure it was moist, etc.  I tried it approximately 10-15 times.  Failed each time, total rip-off at any price.  P.S. I didn&#x27;t buy mine here.  I purchased this product from walgreens.</li>
    <li> This stuff is virtually powder not cement. No matter how much you clean the crown or anything else, it does not work. I&#x27;m going to try superglue if they&#x27;re all like this. And don&#x27;t let anyone scare you about it. All these dentists out there simply don&#x27;t want people fixing their dental work themselves. They&#x27;ll lose too much money.</li>
    <li> Reading the label, I was a little nervous.  This sounded like serious stuff, like you really had to do it right because the dentist is going to have to remove it.  What nonsense!  It goes on just like typical putty or spackling compound, and just like spackling, it will dissolve and crumple in too much water.    Nothing seems to make it want to stick or harden.  If you are really careful, following directions perfectly, and can go a day without food or using your mouth, it will become slightly more solid, but it still will not stick to anything.  The moment you eat or drink something, it just falls apart.    I moistened some up, rolled it into a ball, put it on the counter and waited to see if it ever solidified.  It never really solidified, and the more it did, the more crumbly it became because it had a very inconsistent texture, like a cross between dried gum and Play-doh.  Unlike spackling compound, gum, or even Play-doh, after all that time it had zero sticking power.  It has some sticking ability when you first use it, but that is as strong as it gets.    I cannot recommend this product for repairing or fixing anything dental.  I do not think it would work as spackling either since it is just too weak.</li>
    <li> Been using this product [[ASIN:B001AIWJZU DenTek maximum hold temparin one step (lost filling repair) - 3 ea]] for a couple years now.  It works guaranteed.  You do have to follow instructions.  Don&#x27;t eat anything for or drink anything hot for 2-3 hours though.  One tub last me about a month or 2.  One filling last about 2 weeks depends on what hard food i eat like chips and such.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions and did it. Then I did not eat for over one hour. After my meal it had disappeared, so it had come off quite easily.</li>
    <li> The one they sent was not the pictured item. It was dentek,but inferior to the one pictured. This formulation does not last at all. I still have some sitting around because it doesn&#x27;t work. I was hoping for the one pictured because it at least works. The seller needs to put up the correct picture.  Here is the link to the product they sent me.[...]</li>
    <li> This stuff will work for a temporary filling as long as it is not on the sides of the tooth. Tried this product to hold a crown on... sorry it dont work . Any Pressure and the  crown popped back off. This stuff to thick to be used inside small crowns, I had better luck using Super glue! GEL. The company making this is getting a fortune.. 5.00 for 2 grams? The actual Dental cement cost 14.00 for 20 oz.. NEVER AGAIN...</li>
    <li> I chipped my tooth about three months ago and went and ordered some of this Temparin. Hey, it is as good as it gets! I have used it twice and the secret is to use it just before you go to bed so it has all night to set up before you eat anything. That way it is good and hard. This stuff is really great as long as you use it properly. DON&#x27;T EAT right after you apply it, or you will mess it all up. It has to set for at least two to three hours before you eat.</li>
    <li> great product for temp fix</li>
    <li> The filling didn&#x27;t last a day and fell out while I was eating. It developed into a kidney stone a few days later! Painful!</li>
    <li> put it in your b.o.b.</li>
    <li> While on holiday, I lost the tongue-side of a tooth (in front of molar)... Needed a quick fix.    The negative Temparin reviews may be due to insufficient instructions. Herewith, my addendum:  + Clean the broken area thoroughly. I used a waterpik.  + Area to be filled MUST be WET. Temparin is water-activated.  + Use wet finger and wet cotton swab to shape material.  + Try to shape the filling so that it bears minimal weight.  + Floss sides of tooth to remove excess Temparin.    Eat softer, non-sticky foods till you get to the dentist for a permanent fix... And you WILL need a permanent fix. Chances are slim that you have the equipment and skill required to seal the tooth well enough to avoid further degradation.    My single application held for 3-1/2 weeks. Keeping in mind that these zinc oxide/calcium sulphate mixes are temporary, I am delighted with the result.</li>
    <li> This product does not work. Even if you follow instructions carefully, the \\&quot;filling\\&quot; will still be soft and crumbly. Letting it set overnight will do nothing. The first time you eat something will cause the filling to just smear away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To further test it out, I even dabbed several applications onto a piece of paper. Some I made damp with water, some I made damp with saliva, and some I let dry. After 12 hours? All 6 applications were still soft and crumbly, and they all would easily smear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Putting this on your teeth as a temporary fix will do nothing. The moment you eat something, it will go away. The moment you drink something, it will go away. Does not work for crowns or fillings</li>
    <li> good product for hiking and emergency use</li>
    <li> I tried this whilst on holiday as my tooth filling cracked and fell out.   It was absolute garbage. I read all the instructions properly and carried them out. I am a medical professional although not a dentist and I made sure everything was done correctly, yet it did NOT WORK.  Do not waste your money on this. If I could give it &#x27;no stars&#x27; I would but there is no option.</li>
    <li> They really must have changed it, DENTEK Temparin Max is a soft putty and it just doesn&#x27;t seem to get hard so it doesn&#x27;t take long to wear off, couple of hours max. This was a big waste of a LOT of money. Don&#x27;t bother.&lt;br /&gt; I was looking for &#x27;TOOTHY PEGS&#x27;, a product I had before and recommend. It is like a bit of plastic, you warm it in water and it goes soft like chewing gum, you push it into the hole and then as soon as it cools (which is pretty much immediately) it is like a hard piece of plastic again so you can chew on it no probs.</li>
