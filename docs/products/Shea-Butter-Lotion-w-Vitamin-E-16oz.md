<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have been ordering this product for the past two years from amazon.com after the store that sold this product shut down.  This lotion smells absolutely delicious and leaves you feeling silky smooth if you use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I will go to almost any extreme to find this lotion. Every beauty and health supply store I&#x27;ve ever purchased it from has either closed or discontinued the product. The last time I bought it was from a supplier in Chicago that was discontinuing the line. I bought all the stock they had. The pump is the only issue I have with the product. I&#x27;ve tried other brands of shea butter lotions/moisturizers. None has the refreshing scent or feel of this particular product.</li>
    <li> This lotion has a surprise to it I can not explain.  It takes the swelling out of my feet and ankles when I use it.  I have used it for 3 years. I love the lotion because it makes bare legs look beautiful.  It leaves a shine on your legs that is not greasy or sticky. Be careful of look alikes that is not this specific lotion.</li>
    <li> This product is one of the best shea butter product on the market. Those who have dry skin this product is for you. The price is great, it&#x27;s worth it weight in gold.  I strongly encourage you to try it.  Why pay excess money for all the \\&quot;traditonal skin moisturizers\\&quot; you pay in department and speciality stores; when you have a product like this?</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this product after the few good reviews it received. However upon arrival, I opened it up to smell it and was surprised with the strong smell... I re-read the ingredients and there are no ingredients that indicate any type of perfume or scents. The smell is so nauseating I can&#x27;t even use it. I tried adding essential oils to see if that would help, but it did not. So I have no choice but to throw it away because no one I know will be able to stand the smell either. If you can get past the smell it is really moisturizing, but I can&#x27;t. I was also under the impression that it was from Nubian Heritage, which I&#x27;ve tried their products before and love, but I went to the official website and they do not have such a product for sale, so I don&#x27;t know where this particular product came from. If you can stand the smell and don&#x27;t care about the mystery ingredients, then fine. It was pretty moisturizing the little I tried, so that&#x27;s a positive. Other than that...beware!!!</li>
    <li> best lotion in the world</li>
    <li> I love Shea Butter products. I guess this is a little goes a long way type lotion because too much is very greasy, leaving a film on everything.  However, again it is a little goes a long way, leaving a silky feel too the skin.  I would not use this as a overall body lotion...great for hands</li>
    <li> I overall love this lotion for the sealed moisture that lasts all day. The negative was the vanilla scent that was stated in the in the description. .</li>
    <li> I ordered a 16oz bottle but received a 8oz bottle. The seller fixed the problem promptly and even sent me an extra bottle of the shea butter lotion (which is a great lotion and worth every penny!!) I would definitely order from this seller again and again. 5 STARS!!! :)</li>
    <li> My young daughter has a mild case of eczema, and I have tried everything, but this actully works.  I first found it at my local BBS and it was more expensive.  So I tried Amazon for a better price.  Price was right.  I can actully tell when she does not use it.  This has made a huge difference for her.</li>
    <li> The best lotion ever . I&#x27;ve been using this product for 15 years . S long ss thry make this product i will never us anythig else. The greatest ever made.</li>
    <li> very pleased to find this online, looked many places could not find in local department stores.. has a very nice light fragrance and goes on smooth not sticky. I purchased two 16oz bottles which provided free shipping(great value), I will order again once my lotion runs out.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years.  I moved from New York to Florida and have found it difficult to find it where I live.  That is why I order it from Amazon.  This is the only lotion that actually moisturizes my skin.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I heard so many wonderful reviews on a popular video channel about this product.  I can&#x27;t say enough about how great this stuff is for natural hair.  It&#x27;s probably good for any kind of hair.</li>
    <li> It is a very excellent product. Havr been using this for yrs and was disappointed when i moved to a state that didnt have it. It has a great smell and a little really goes a long way. Thank you amazon for supplying this.</li>
    <li> Once I had received this lotion I quickly realized that it is NOT made by Shea Moisture. Got to their true site and check to make sure that the right product is bought. This is a fake, it contains methyl paraben among other things and is not organic like the true company&#x27;s products. Shea Moisture has many great products and this is not one of them.</li>
    <li> Great!!!!!! It&#x27;s a very good product. I love the smell of this lotion and it keeps you moisturized all day.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion.  It has a very nice smell.  It is a shame that I can only find it on line.</li>
    <li> I would like to state that this product \\&quot;SHEA BUTTER LOTION WITH VITAMIN E, is and always will be the only lotion I will use.    I have been using this product for the past 15 yrs.   It was introduced to me by a co worker, as he was selling this part time.  Well I changed jobs and lost contact.  I searched high and low, before realizing I could find this on the internet.    I was back in the swing of things again.   I will never deviate from using this product... its just that good for me!</li>
    <li> I just love this product and the service Amazon brings</li>
    <li> Shea Moisture Shea Butter Lotion with Vitamin E is a lotion that my husband and I can use. It has a pleasant not overpowering feminine scent, it is thick enough to moisturize the skin without being greasy, it makes the skin soft, it has enough emollient properties and the moisturizing properties last all day.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for over ten years.  It has a subtle, unobtrusive scent; it absorbs well, and it LASTS.</li>
    <li> I stumbled on this lotion in a beauty supply store and fell in love.  The beauty store was selling it for around $27!  Amazon to the rescue because I was not about to pay that price.  This lotion smells great! It coats the skin like Nivea lotion.  No need to keep reapplying...unless you wash it off.  I promise you will love it!</li>
    <li> Love the actual product but was unable to pump it out the bottle.  Otherwise great lotion.  Love the large size bottle.</li>
    <li> I love the lotion; I hate the pump. Formula is extremely rich and too many times the pump on my bottle has not worked.</li>
    <li> The lotion is very nice. It is not greasy. Nice fragrance. Very thick when purchased so it must be put on warm water for a while then it is creamy. It arrive very quickly. Will purchase again</li>
    <li> I am glad to get a bigger size bottle of this Shea Butter lotion, Yay !!!!! I just love it .... Can&#x27;t get enough of this Shea butter lotion! Now, my sister wants a bottle...</li>
    <li> Super, SUPER,  rich and moisturizing! If thick lotion is what you like, this is a keeper. I persuaded my mother to give me her extra bottle and had to hunt it down on Amazon when I needed more. It&#x27;s that good! I wish they made it in a jar for easier use because it&#x27;s so thick sometimes it is too much for the pump. But still worth it!</li>
    <li> I received my first bottle of lotion from my brother and lived it and when I started running low i ordered my bottles from Amazon. The lotion is so good smells good leaves my dry skin so moist. Its the best my feet shine and it last all day. This is the best lotion ever.</li>
