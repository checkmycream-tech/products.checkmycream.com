      <li>I have naturally straight hair that is a bit on the fine side, so I like volumizing products.</li>
      <li>but I think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t colored my hair in about 2 months and aside from the roots, my hair looks totally healthy and natural.  </li>
      <li>what I like about this product is that gives me volume without using any product in my hair, For 25 dollars is worth the try.</li>
      <li>and it looks beautiful thick and shines.</li>
      <li>This is a great product for fine, thin hair...</li>
      <li>I just received this product and so far, it seems as if my hair feels super clean.  </li>
      <li>I liked it so much I decided to order some when I got back home.  </li>
      <li>Really improves thinning hair!</li>
      <li>This shampoo, while definitely expensive, is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>So gentle on the hair!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sorry I did.  </li>
      <li>I first tried it at a friend&#x27;s house while visiting.</li>
      <li>Most don&#x27;t do much, but I have rated this as a five star because it does give my hair extra volume.</li>
      <li>, my hair is full of life and so shinny , im 40 years old</li>
      <li>I have been looking for a shampoo that did not strip out my natural oils but would clean in a gentle way.</li>
      <li>This shampoo does so much for your hair.</li>
      <li>I feel this product is very over rated.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this shampoo!  </li>
      <li>Great for thin hair.</li>
      <li>My hair is a pretty short, low maintenance cut so if it&#x27;s supposed to make it look like I have more hair then fat chance of that happening.  </li>
      <li>Like another customer, though, I definitely advise against ordering it on the special.</li>
      <li>Kronos shampoo has really made my thinning hair much more manageable, and the thinning is less.  </li>
      <li>I start getting new hair growth after using this shampoo!</li>
      <li>but as I get older it is thinning.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend Kronos K-Charge Volumizing Cleaning Treatment and Conditioner.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend to everybody.</li>
      <li>I have tried several other high end products but went back to KRONOS and am loving my hair again!</li>
      <li>Thoes of you ladies who spend a little or a lot try this product you will love it.</li>
      <li>This shampoo, this conditioner, a squirt of Fanci-Full temporary hair color, and I&#x27;m free to worry about something other than my hair.</li>
      <li>My hair feels a little strange right after washing, but the conditioner softens it up appropriately.</li>
      <li>live without it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot.</li>
      <li>I have even noticed some new re-growth.</li>
      <li>It is impossible to find locally so we depend on Amazon to have this great shampoo available.</li>
      <li>This product does clean my hair very well and with about half of the amount of shampoo.  </li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ll be delightfully surprised!</li>
      <li>I think you need to use both the shampoo AND the conditioner to get good results, because after using the Kronos shampoo and a conditioner of a different brand for a few weeks, I noticed that my hair started breaking off in massive amounts.</li>
      <li>My hair is pretty thick but extremely fine and can go limp easily.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My hair is awesome after using this product- Full and shiny.</li>
    <li> Nothing too  extraordinary. Not worth the $.  I like the shampoo way better than i liked the conditioner.  Oh we&#x27;ll.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Makes my hair look noticeably fuller. [[ASIN:B001SBM9A4 Kronos K-Charge Volumizing Cleansing Treatment 10 fl oz.]]</li>
    <li> I paid $35 for this shampoo with great hopes of having fabulous hair.  Due to a very long check in line at the airport, I was forced to carry on my bag, and the security people confiscated it (too many ounces and I may shampoo someone to death) and threw it away before I could use it.  At $35, I&#x27;ve not been able to buy more and review it properly.  But stayed tuned for a follow up review.</li>
    <li> Kronos shampoo has really made my thinning hair much more manageable, and the thinning is less.  I&#x27;ve tried many other products through the years, but none have been as effective as Kronos.</li>
    <li> I keep buying this thing...LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> My wife will not use anything else. It is impossible to find locally so we depend on Amazon to have this great shampoo available.</li>
    <li> I did a trial for this shampoo and it completely dried out my hair and it looked thinner and it was so brittle that I couldn&#x27;t run my hairbrush though it without tons of hair breaking off or facing a massive knot. It is insanely expensive and it does nothing that a dollar shampoo wouldn&#x27;t do to my hair.</li>
    <li> i tried the shampoo conditioner for this brand and while i can say my hair is shiny and very silky feeling, it looks flat and limp. and i&#x27;ve only used it twice.</li>
    <li> I have been using Kronos products for  over 10 years.  With my color treatments &amp; with age, my hair was thin &amp; flat with little to no body. With this product &amp; continued use it is more manageable &amp; looks so much better.  I have not found in any store a product which gives me the results.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! Really improves thinning hair!</li>
    <li> This product is more like a conditioner than a cleanser.    This one is Okay but for a volumizing shampoo, id recommend Purology over this one.</li>
    <li> I have tried many shampoos for baby fine thinning hair.  Most don&#x27;t do much, but I have rated this as a five star because it does give my hair extra volume. I&#x27;ve been using this product for at least a year.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a shampoo that did not strip out my natural oils but would clean in a gentle way. I do not like to wash my hair often because it takes a while to dry. So this product has been excellent for me.</li>
    <li> This shampoo, while definitely expensive, is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I bleach my hair, so it gets dry sometimes, but this shampoo adds moisture while also adding great volume. My hair is straight as a stick, but it takes and holds curl a lot better now. I highly recommend it. Like another customer, though, I definitely advise against ordering it on the special. One of the \\&quot;extra\\&quot; products that they sent along for me to try was horrible. I used the \\&quot;leave-in\\&quot; treatment overnight, and it was so strong that it burned my nostrils and all I could smell for two days was the smell of the product. I ended up plugging my nose with tissue and breathing through my mouth - not attractive, but necessary! Stick with the shampoo and you&#x27;ll be delightfully surprised!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend Kronos K-Charge Volumizing Cleaning Treatment and Conditioner.  I have been using both of these products for several years now.  It seems to have slowed down (or even stopped) my hair from thinning out while still leaving it silky and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo that works for my hair. It makes my&lt;br /&gt;thin hair have volumn,shine and smells good too.When I consider&lt;br /&gt;that I don&#x27;t use any other products except finish spray, this line of&lt;br /&gt;shampoo and conditioners, is very inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I just received this product and so far, it seems as if my hair feels super clean.  I don&#x27;t usually spend this much on shampoo, but decided to treat myself.  I do think my hairs feels stronger if that makes sense.  I may purchase the conditioner as well.</li>
    <li> Bought this product along with the hair conditioner and was not impressed.  I feel this product is very over rated.</li>
    <li> This shampoo really makes my blonde hair shine.  I first tried it at a friend&#x27;s house while visiting. I liked it so much I decided to order some when I got back home.  I&#x27;m not sorry I did.  My bus driver has even started calling me Goldilocks. In addition to the shine, it also makes my hair easy to manage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hooked on this shampoo.  I have slightly oily, straight, and limp hair.  I&#x27;ve used other name brand products that are supposed to give volume but they don&#x27;t compare to the K-Charge.</li>
    <li> I am in my 6o&#x27;s and look like Im in my 40&#x27;s so my friends and family tell me.......  At my age I have started to loose my hair, you know thinning. Well I tried this product in 2009 and have been using it ever since. Yes it is very expensive. They the makers could lower the price and or have sales once in a while. The best part is that you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of the product. I have very long hair and I dye my hair and it looks beautiful thick and shines. I love this product. This product Kronos [[ASIN:B001SBM9A4 Kronos K-Charge Volumizing Cleansing Treatment 10 fl oz.]][[ASIN:B001STAB1K Kronos Phyx Intensive Hair Repair Masque 4 fl oz.]][[ASIN:B004CFUR66 Kronos Liquid Theory 7-in-1 Conditioning Spray 4 fl oz.]][[ASIN:B001U8XP80 Kronos Hydresse Hydrating Conditioner 8 fl oz.]]sure does what it says it can do. I continue to get compliments and turned heads at my age! I love it. It makes me feel young again.Thoes of you ladies who spend a little or a lot try this product you will love it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Kronos K-Charge Vol. Cleans. Tr. for quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t live without it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 57 and have never found anything that works as great as this.  My hair is smooth, glossy and thick.  I found this about 8 months ago and I&#x27;ll never use anything else. You only need a little so it lasts a long time too. I use it with the conditioner.  Unbeatable combo!</li>
    <li> I love the jrinis product. It really needs to be used with all Kronis products to obtain best results. Smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> I was losing my hair and started using this- not only did it help but, my hair is soft, no tangles - been using this product for 3 years - just wish I could get the spray</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shampoo and the conditioner that goes with it. My hair is pretty thick but extremely fine and can go limp easily. Kronos volumizing shampoo and conditioner give my hair body and style. It took a few weeks for the full effect to kick in, but once it did I can really see the difference. My hair feels a little strange right after washing, but the conditioner softens it up appropriately. I tend to buy the shampoo and conditioner separately because it&#x27;s cheaper that way, for some reason. I don&#x27;t plan to change shampoos--ever!</li>
    <li> REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT AND HAVE USED IT FOR SEVERAL YEARS.  DOES NOT AFFECT MY HAIR COLOR AND NO SHAMPOO BUILD UP.  MY HAIR IS SHINEY AND EASY TO MANAGE.</li>
    <li> Would recommend this great shampoo for anyone with fine hair, helps to give you the volume you are missing! Also try the conditioner.</li>
    <li> I tried this product through one of those trial offers.  (Note:  Do not do this as they send you a kit of 4 products and bill you $98 if you don&#x27;t return it within the month.)  So I was anxious to see if I could get it here on Amazon and I&#x27;m delighted I can.    I&#x27;m not sure if my hair has gotten thicker, but it shines like crazy!  I haven&#x27;t colored my hair in about 2 months and aside from the roots, my hair looks totally healthy and natural.  And a great shine!  Light and fluffy feel even if I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day.  This is positively the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.  I don&#x27;t even need the conditioner!    Yes, it is costly, but you can avoid waste by adding some water to the shampoo.  You have to be careful not to dump it all in your hand, but you won&#x27;t be using as much shampoo as if you used it without the water.  In other words, less waste and lasts longer.    I highly recommend this shampoo!  Thank you!  MEF</li>
    <li> Ladies if you want flat, stick to your head hair, please buy and use this shampoo! I got this thinking it would make my hair look fuller, but it was so greasy looking, my hair had to be washed again, with a different shampoo! Never will I order again!</li>
    <li> I have thin hair and this shampoo makes it feel and look thicker.  When you have thin hair every little bit helps.  It&#x27;s expensive but I think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have gray hair and used this shampoo at a friends house. Perlized and creamy. Produces a rich lather from which hair gets squeaky clean. My hair feels and looks silkier and shinier than it has in ages. Expensive but does the job.</li>
    <li> This product does clean my hair very well and with about half of the amount of shampoo.  As for volumizing, I am not sure what that is supposed to mean.  My hair is a pretty short, low maintenance cut so if it&#x27;s supposed to make it look like I have more hair then fat chance of that happening.  It talks about T-sphere technology which is supposed to deliver the cleaning to the root of the hair.  I can&#x27;t tell you if it really does that or not, but it does seem to clean my hair very well and with half the amount of my previous shampoo.  I&#x27;ve only used this for a week so I&#x27;ll try to update this half way through the bottle and then when it&#x27;s done.  Merry Christmas Everyone!</li>
    <li> I first used this product last summer and it made my hair extremely thick and shiny. I have naturally straight hair that is a bit on the fine side, so I like volumizing products. Well, after I ran out of product last year I forgot about this shampoo and didn&#x27;t remember it again until this year... My results are a bit different this time around. I only ordered the shampoo this time and didn&#x27;t use conditioner (thinking I could save a couple bucks). I think you need to use both the shampoo AND the conditioner to get good results, because after using the Kronos shampoo and a conditioner of a different brand for a few weeks, I noticed that my hair started breaking off in massive amounts. I stopped using the shampoo for now... I&#x27;ll order the conditioner and hopefully duplicate my results from last year.</li>
    <li> Think it makes your hair thin in time....awful</li>
    <li> This shampoo does so much for your hair. Makes it fuller, richer and&lt;br /&gt;very manageable. Love this product and buy it often.</li>
    <li> I love this product...You really do nice a difference in your hair after a couple washes!  I have a license and get all kinds of discounts but I will still use this on my hair!</li>
    <li> Was looking forward for this item to arrive and I ended up so dissapointed when I opened the box to an opened bottle. The &amp;#34;sealed for your protection&amp;#34; seal was opened when it arrived.... Returned...</li>
    <li> It leaves my hair soft and managable.  I am sensitive to may shampoos and conditioners and I find this brand great.  I have used it for years and love it,</li>
    <li> Treat this like gold;you only have to use small amout.Hair lays perfectly after dried and brushed.&lt;br /&gt;Cleans well without having to use all the time.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for at least 3 years and it&#x27;s still the best thing in my shower. My fine hair is silky, shiny and has very little product buildup. Like the conditioner, too. Can be pricey; I stock up during internet sales.</li>
    <li> My Wife ordered this and loves it. It does seem to add Volume to your hair, and makes it soft and shiney.</li>
    <li> I receive this as a gift I use it and I LOVE IT , my hair is full of life and so shinny , im 40 years old I take good care of my hair im always trying new products and this one is the best . I know is expensive , is cheaper to purchased here in amazon in the website they send it for free it was 40 dollars , maybe is better to start with the trial version of it that for 4 product is 25 dollars , Sometimes shampoo and conditioner do not work the same for every person , im Puertorrican my hair is very thin and long what I like about this product is that gives me volume without using any product in my hair, For 25 dollars is worth the try. I purchased the others items from the line I will let you know my thoughts when I receive them and use them , So far this Shampoo and Conditioner is great .</li>
    <li> This shampoo has a very, very light scent. Your scalp feels so clean! I have a lot of curly hair but as I get older it is thinning. I have tried many of the hair loss products and those with Nioxin and Minoxidil caused me to blister all over my scalp plus they stunk. I&#x27;m an obese, hormonal woman and I sweat which makes my hair look greasy, stringy, and THIN. Kronos K-Charge shampoo gives me a clean scalp and clean hair full of body. I have even noticed some new re-growth.</li>
    <li> Makes my bleached  hair fuller, healthier, shinier. I start getting new hair growth after using this shampoo! Highly recommend to everybody.</li>
    <li> Works well on my fine hair. Very pleased</li>
    <li> Best shampoo ever! Great for thin hair. So gentle on the hair!</li>
    <li> Greatest shampoo ever and one bottle lasts 3 months.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for a few years and it works well.  My hair seems healthier and shinier!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I considered rating this because I know there must be other women &#x27;of a certain age&#x27; that would like to have thicker hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily or heavy. My hair is soft, shiny and manageable. I received my product in a timely fashion as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My age is 44, I color my hair as it is mostly gray now. I am Hispanic. My hair is long with a mix of frizzy, wavy and straight.</li>
    <li> I used these products 3 yrs ago and received RAVE REVIEWS everywhere I went from family and stylists even strangers commented on how beautiful my hair was.  It has TONS of body... Moves beautifully and seems fuller with dramatically less hair \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hair  loss.  I have tried several other high end products but went back to KRONOS and am loving my hair again! I&#x27;m 63 and my hair looks like I&#x27;m 35!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for fine, thin hair...along with the conditioner...my hair has much more body after using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve kissed a lot of frogs...er hair products in a quest to bring life to an aging, thinning head of hair.  This shampoo, this conditioner, a squirt of Fanci-Full temporary hair color, and I&#x27;m free to worry about something other than my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo  I have been using this for years.  My hair is fine and this keep my hair feeling like i have more hair.</li>
