      <li>Works great.  </li>
      <li>in all a great addition to the Wahl line</li>
      <li>I think that it&#x27;s a great unisex device</li>

      <li>The battery works great</li>
      <li>Trimming my beard has become a joy.</li>
      <li>If I get a couple of years out of this one, I&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, it gets the job done, so I&#x27;m happy.  </li>
      <li>However,  it doesn&#x27;t have many options to pick the best length.</li>
      <li>nice to hold - great ergonomics</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good trimmer.</li>
      <li>frustration free packaging on this product was wonderful, as always.  </li>
      <li>My beard has never looked as good as it does now.</li>
      <li>&gt;·  Good quality&lt;</li>
      <li>husband loved it..</li>
      <li>I am rounding it up to 4, because I don&#x27;t think it is fair to rate it as 3</li>
      <li>Wahl products are good for hair clippers, pet clippers, etc.  </li>
      <li>This addition of the adjustable clip guard is good news since now</li>
      <li>This expanded version of the kit also features the detail trimmer which I like for cleaning out and around my goatee and the mini-shaver which works good for cleaning up in and around my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It also does an excellent job of a clean shave.</li>
      <li>The Wahl 9867-300 Lithium Ion All-in-One Trimmer works great for many trimming chores.</li>
      <li>I have used Wahl trimmers for many years, and have always thought they were the best available.</li>
      <li>The guards lock in place and provide great, precise trimming.  </li>

      <li>The travel case is a nice addition.  </li>
      <li>The 8 position levels for the plastic guides is nice and can let you achieve</li>
      <li>is my feedback - mom, 40 something, and I like to be tidy for the beach and bikinis.</li>
      <li>It probably cost Wahl all of (maybe) 25 cents, but it&#x27;s a nice addition.</li>
      <li>So while the unit won&#x27;t win any prizes for industrial design, it gets the job done cleanly and effectively.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a decent beard trimmer and shaver, but in my experience, these kinds of units can either be great shavers, or great beard trimmers, but never both.</li>
      <li>that does as good a job (or even better) than this more pricey one.</li>
      <li>* is very easy: you just push up against the blade with your thumb and the head pops off.  </li>
      <li>All in all, it isn&#x27;t my Braun, but it&#x27;s pretty darn close at a great price.</li>
      <li>I also like the blades on these as they are very accurate and efficient.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, for very light maintenance it works well.</li>
      <li>I think what they tried to do with this clipper is make it very light.</li>
      <li>The carrying case is a nice touch and makes traveling with the unit easy.</li>
      <li>what more do u want?</li>
      <li>I have bought several Wahl trimmers over the years, and this may be the best of them.  </li>
      <li>I have worn a beard for more than 30-years.</li>
      <li>This is one of the best models of personal trimmers I have ever found.  </li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
      <li>mostly like the guide comb</li>
      <li>I like to be able to vary the length of the hairs depending upon where on my face and neck</li>
      <li>My favorite trimmer was a Braun, that I dropped one too many times.  </li>
      <li>He&#x27;s been using Wahls for years, probably fifteen or more.</li>
      <li>Love this trimmer.  </li>
      <li>but I’m leaning towards the Wahl as the better trimming experience once you learn how NOT to hold it.</li>
      <li>switch :)</li>
      <li>Used it hrs after charging it out of the box and still haven&#x27;t changed it yet, unbelievably better than Phillips norelco</li>
      <li>though a more substantial brush would be even easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I guess if you use it without the attachments it&#x27;s OK, but even tin that instance, you can do better.</li>
      <li>I LOVE the way the guide works -</li>
      <li>/&gt;I may need more time with the trimmer and I might revisit this review</li>
      <li>I have not been able to determine standby time, but there is a “charge 1 minute, run for 3” feature which seems to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have always been satisfied with the quality and performance of the Whal products I&#x27;ve owned</li>
      <li>It may be better suited for finer hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>is a name that our family has trusted for many years.</li>
      <li>Gives you a nice clean shave.</li>
      <li>Having said that, this Wahl trimmer is pretty good.  </li>
      <li>Adjustable stops are adequate...not as finely tunable as some, but should be able to please most people</li>
      <li>Between the two the Wahl trimmer is smaller, sleeker, more attractive and fits in my hand better.</li>
      <li>Working great so far.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m happy with it so far.</li>
      <li>.. works great so far</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m thinking most families wouldn&#x27;t feel comfortable sharing.</li>
      <li>The cordless design made using it particularly easy.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The carrying bag is helpful for keeping my bathroom cabinet organized, and also makes it easy to pack this for trips.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Heads are easily changed out&lt;br</li>
      <li>Easy to switch attachments.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>Wahl offers a five year warranty for good reason – their stuff has always been top notch.&lt;br</li>
      <li>strong motor&lt;br /&gt;Cuts</li>
      <li>, I kind of felt like I was breaking it the first time I did it.  </li>
      <li>It took me a while to review this product because I wanted to use it for more than just a couple of times to get a true picture of how it stands the test of time.  </li>
      <li>After plugging in the correct charger it worked fine.</li>
      <li>I could hear my husband using it from another room, the motor has power and sounds strong, not whiney like a cheap toy.  </li>
      <li>I accidently plugged my Wahl trimmer in using my Remington charger which fit just fine</li>
      <li>This is a great little trimmer, nice design and holds charge.  </li>
      <li>As a kid, I remember being fascinated by the huge (to a child’s eyes)</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t a huge deal.</li>
      <li>But the trimmer blades cut precise, and are tight/close together.</li>
      <li>Overall, a great buy.</li>
      <li>load and sort of cheap... was looking for the type they use at the barber, this is a cheapish one</li>
      <li>I have always had to use my shaver after trimming to get smooth skin where I don&#x27;t want any hair at all and with this unit I still do.</li>
      <li>One problem is that there&#x27;s no indicator light to tell you if it&#x27;s charging, or when it&#x27;s fully charged.</li>
      <li>The rechargeable battery and the light weight make it a pleasure to use.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Everything I asked for. Trims nicely and I&#x27;m happy with it so far.</li>
    <li> load and sort of cheap... was looking for the type they use at the barber, this is a cheapish one</li>
    <li> Good quality!!  Husband loves!!</li>
    <li> husband loved it.. was christmas present.. works great so far</li>
    <li> Powerful unit that does the job intended for it. Would have given it 4 stars if the charger wouldn&#x27;t keep falling out of the unit. If not kept plugged in battery depletes quickly.</li>
    <li> I have had a beard for over 45 years and have had a number of trimmers. This Whal trimmer is to the best I have used. Trimming my beard has become a joy. My beard has never looked as good as it does now. The attachments are great and I particularly like the small shaver attachment.</li>
    <li> Works well on shorter hair, longer is tougher though.</li>
    <li> I really like the close-shaving foil attachment and the battery charges very quickly and has stayed steady over the last month without a recharge. I also like the blades on these as they are very accurate and efficient. Just be sure not to bang the unit too much to get the hair out, as it is made of plastic and I already broke a similar one I had after three years of use. Keep this regularly oiled, too. I&#x27;d say once every six months on the spinning mechanism and all the blades will do the trick.</li>
    <li> Used it hrs after charging it out of the box and still haven&#x27;t changed it yet, unbelievably better than Phillips norelco</li>
    <li> This review is courtesy of my husbands use of this trimmer:  I have coarse facial hair and this razor would catch on my beard.  Not a very pleasant experience.  The rubber grip on the side of the razor is a magnet for clipped hair, dust and whatever other loose particles that come in contact with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The built-in guard works well and the accessories seem useful.  However the razor doesn&#x27;t seem powerful or sharp enough.  It may be better suited for finer hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does charge quickly, however the base station and the charger are not a single integrated unit.  This isn&#x27;t a huge deal. but it just seems a little silly to have to plug in the razor, then place it into the holder, and vice versa.</li>
    <li> While this looks like and is packaged like an industrial razor - plain brown box and instructions that combine the usual safety warnings with actual helpful information - the razor itself is actually very impressive. First let me be clear that this is a trimmer by design, with both a wide and a narrow trimmer module that can be attached to the top of the unit, all topped by a removable guide that allows you to select hair length. However, there is an ultra-close razor attachment that can be mounted to replace the trimmer modules and which is superb for body hair. This works well, without any pulling, and can easily be used in more sensitive areas without fear. The battery is long lasting and charges quickly. So while the unit won&#x27;t win any prizes for industrial design, it gets the job done cleanly and effectively. Brilliant.</li>
    <li> I have used Wahl trimmers for many years, and have always thought they were the best available. This unit has lots of options for trimming various parts of the body, but I am disappointed by its performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 9867-300 has one major positive feature: the lithium ion battery. The battery charges very quickly and holds its charge for long periods of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The major drawbacks of this product are its performance and its price. It has a tendency to pull your whiskers, and costs twice as much as its less expensive counterpart. For the money, I far prefer the [[ASIN:B00009RF1E Wahl 9918-6171 Groomsman Beard and Mustache Trimmer]] that does as good a job (or even better) than this more pricey one.</li>
    <li> This product worked great getting my beard into shape with just a few easy strokes. The cordless design made using it particularly easy.</li>
    <li> I confess: I&#x27;m a gal using a guy&#x27;s trimmer  - I&#x27;ve used a couple of different trimmers like this one, actually, for about 10 years for my bikini line.  I can&#x27;t use a regular blade or wax, I get tons of ugly bumps that are just as yucky as if I hadn&#x27;t shaved.  But a guy&#x27;s trimmer gets close enough when I don&#x27;t use the guard, not to mention it&#x27;s quick and easy before putting on a swimsuit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adjustable guard allows for me to trim other body areas that I do keep shaved, such as my arms.  Just make sure you use the little lock button to keep the guard at the height you select, or it just slides back down as you go (yes, I forgot this once or twice!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the heads more difficult to change than I&#x27;d like, I kind of felt like I was breaking it the first time I did it.  I used the tiny one for nose hairs (yes, sorry guys, but girls have to do this too!), and was able to do the job quickly.  However, this particular head heated up very quickly, so I&#x27;m glad this is a small area to complete, or it would have been uncomfortable.  The basic head heats up too, but the plastic guard keeps your skin from feeling it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The carrying bag is helpful for keeping my bathroom cabinet organized, and also makes it easy to pack this for trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The frustration free packaging on this product was wonderful, as always.  I appreciate not having to cut into thick, unrecyclable plastic clamshells, while being able to recycle the cardboard pieces with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like using this particular Wahl product for my needs.  It is comfortable, not too loud, and the charge lasted for several uses of full-body detailing before I had to recharge.  From a girl&#x27;s point of view, this product is very helpful!</li>
    <li> I could hear my husband using it from another room, the motor has power and sounds strong, not whiney like a cheap toy.  A bit old school looking, but clippers have a nice weight and not a toss-a-way light weight feeling like some trimmers.  Does a heck of a good job on close shave beards and mustaches and all the other fun stuff we have to trim. ;)</li>
    <li> My husband uses this all the time .</li>
    <li> Got this for myself but had my 23 year old son use it first because it&#x27;s designed for a guy. Here is his feedback:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This worked really well for maintaining a trim cut beard after I got the hang of how to use the trimming head. I found the nose hair clipper / trimmer to be really helpful and useful. I&#x27;ve had a round one in the past and this was much easier to maneuver with more precise control.  It also really works well for places like near my ears and sideburns - I always screw those up with a reguar cutting head so the smaller one gave me far more control in those areas where a small mistake is pretty noticeable. The unit seemed pretty powerful and fast and much lighter than the older trimmer I had been using (a Remington.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my feedback - mom, 40 something, and I like to be tidy for the beach and bikinis. This is a great little device for extra close trimming.  I actually like the nose hair clipper part as well because it&#x27;s so small. I think that it&#x27;s a great unisex device but I&#x27;m thinking most families wouldn&#x27;t feel comfortable sharing.</li>
    <li> The Wahl Trimmer is a quality trimmer, ideally suited for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;·  Good quality&lt;br /&gt;o  Solid construction that feels good (and sturdy) in the hand&lt;br /&gt;o  Quick to charge (half hour-ish), holds charge for weeks without use&lt;br /&gt;o  charge is generally good for several uses (assuming full beard trimming)&lt;br /&gt;o  trimmer noise is average&lt;br /&gt;·  Convenient&lt;br /&gt;o  Slim size and small traveling case means it&#x27;s easily slipped into a briefcase or overnight bag&lt;br /&gt;o  No separate \\&quot;combs\\&quot;...built in adjustable guide works well and is well marked/indexed&lt;br /&gt;§  Guard is comfortable...edges aren&#x27;t pointy like some trimmers&lt;br /&gt;§  Adjustable stops are adequate...not as finely tunable as some, but should be able to please most people&lt;br /&gt;o  Different attachment heads available for this model definitely make it much more versatile than most trimmers&lt;br /&gt;§  Comes with a \\&quot;standard\\&quot; head for beards (and chests (?) according to the instructions) but probably a bit small to conveniently use for a quick \\&quot;buzz\\&quot; haircut&lt;br /&gt;§  Heads are easily changed out&lt;br /&gt;o  Easy to clean and lubricate&lt;br /&gt;§  Exposed blades and clean design means it&#x27;s easy to clean and lubricate the blades&lt;br /&gt;§  Kit comes with small container of mineral oil and brush for cleaning...though a more substantial brush would be even easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been traveling with this trimmer for the last month and have no complaints at all.</li>
    <li> Working great so far. Battery charges quick and the blade seems really sharp. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year and it hasn&#x27;t dulled.</li>
    <li> Will not hold a charge, less than a year old.</li>
    <li> Love this trimmer.  I use hair cutting shears and trimmers all the time and in the past I had been critical about the Wahl brand.  Their products seemed too heavy and over-priced.  This trimmer is neither.  It is light-weight and fits comfortably in your hand to give you the best cutting positions.  The battery works great and I can&#x27;t tell you how long a single charge lasts because it is still going on the first charge.</li>
    <li> The Wahl 9867-300 Lithium Ion All-in-One Trimmer works great for many trimming chores. I have worn a beard for more than 30-years. I have used all sorts of trimmers, from the old style electric razors to &amp;#34;throw-away&amp;#34; cheap battery powered trimmers. Whal is on of those companies that offers a wide range of trimmer types and prices. I have always been satisfied with the quality and performance of the Whal products I&#x27;ve owned and I&#x27;ve owned quite a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea of this trimmer set is that you have one power unit and three different interchangeable trimming tools. The set also comes with trimming guide combs, adapter, charging stand and a small tube of lubricant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three heads include a trimming head that works with the guide combs, a small trimming or &amp;#34;detail&amp;#34; head and a shaver head. The trimmer works very well, it cuts well, doesn&#x27;t pull and the guide combs stay put in the body of the trimmer while working. The small detail trimmer also works well for nose hair, around the ears, sideburns and all those little nooks and crannies that need an occasional touch up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I deducted one star for the performance of the shaver. I have owned several of these multipurpose facial hair trimmers over the years. Some with interchangeable heads, some with trimmers on the top and shavers on the bottom, but all the shavers have been a little sub par. I&#x27;m not sure what the trade off is, but the shavers just never work very well. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the shaver does work and it will do a reasonable job, but compared to the quality of the trimming and compared to other shavers, it just doesn&#x27;t stand up well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wahl 9867-300 Lithium Ion All-in-One Trimmer is a very good system for the price and good system at any price.</li>
    <li> This Wahl trimmer is all right, but it isn&#x27;t salon-grade, for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels cheap and plasticy, and the heads they include with it don&#x27;t really impress me all that much. That being said, it is quite functional, and your average user will probably like this unit just fine. I have reviewed quite a few shavers over time, and I have come to have a pretty fine eye for these things. Nothing about this unit jumps out at me. I do like that they aren&#x27;t using touch-controls for the unit. I also like the quick-charging battery, and the lithium-ion capacity and performance of the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a decent beard trimmer and shaver, but in my experience, these kinds of units can either be great shavers, or great beard trimmers, but never both. This one tries to be both, and like all the rest who have tried, I think it fails at it. There aren&#x27;t a large variety of trimming tools available, and the shaving options are foil-based, which I don&#x27;t really care for, and they are set in that dual rotary-drum layout which I REALLY don&#x27;t care for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There isn&#x27;t anything really WRONG with this unit, it just isn&#x27;t stellar. So, I am giving it 4 stars, because Amazon won&#x27;t let me do partial stars, but my actual rating is 3.5 stars. I am rounding it up to 4, because I don&#x27;t think it is fair to rate it as 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.5 stars</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this trimmer.  He&#x27;s a big fan of Wahl products in general.  It works as it&#x27;s supposed to, and he has no complaints.</li>
    <li> Wahl has a great little workhorse in this all in one trimmer. The unit feels sturdy in the hand, isn&#x27;t terribly loud, and the battery lasts a very long time which is a big bonus when you don&#x27;t have an outlet in your bathroom and have to set it up special to charge. (Our house is old, and yeah, no bathroom plug is really annoying.) The attachments give you the flexibility to handle whatever your needs are, whether trimming or outright shaving. The blade guides are the only nitpick we have, they seem to go from almost down to the skin on the lowest one, to not quite short enough at the next step up, but that could be a personal preference and your mileage may vary. The carrying case is a nice touch and makes traveling with the unit easy. A definite win at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I have a full beard that I like to keep trimmed, as well as a closely-cropped head. My usual trimmer, the Braun Cruzer 6 Beard &amp; Head Trimmer, does a very good job of keeping both in check. But it&#x27;s always worth exploring new products, so I was excited to try the Wahl 9867-300, especially since it features a fast-charging lithium battery. Wahl is an old and respected name in trimmers, and you can see them used in barber shops all over the US. Sadly, this trimmer doesn&#x27;t quite live up to the reputation. The device itself is OK, if very narrow. The biggest  problem is the quality of the included attachments - the combs that determine the length and evenness of the cut. They are flimsy and flexible, so that the level adjustment means little. Compared to my Braun when se to an identical length, the Wahl leaves behind an uneven facescape of hairs of varying length, whereas the Braun is very even. I guess if you use it without the attachments it&#x27;s OK, but even tin that instance, you can do better. The battery does indeed charge up quickly, and seems to hold the charge for a long time. One problem is that there&#x27;s no indicator light to tell you if it&#x27;s charging, or when it&#x27;s fully charged. Granted, it costs less than the Braun, but in personal grooming tools that&#x27;s a false economy.</li>
    <li> Twice as expensive as my last Wahl and does half as good as a job.  Not too impressed.</li>
    <li> It took me a while to review this product because I wanted to use it for more than just a couple of times to get a true picture of how it stands the test of time.  My favorite trimmer was a Braun, that I dropped one too many times.  If I had the opportunity, there is no trimmer I would rate higher than Braun.  Having said that, this Wahl trimmer is pretty good.  What I like about it is that the guides are &amp;#34;built in&amp;#34;.  Just a click of a button and the height of the trim can be changed.  I wish that the guides felt a little stronger.  I am worried that I will break them.  This is ideal, because there are no guides to lose in the bathroom drawer!  The head is smaller than I am used to, but not detrimentally so. Battery life has been great, and it doesn&#x27;t slow down for tougher hair.  All in all, it isn&#x27;t my Braun, but it&#x27;s pretty darn close at a great price.</li>
    <li> I was excited to purchase a new trimmer and was looking forward to having a nice new sharp long lasting trimmer.  With the Wahl name. However i was very disappointed . First i notice when my facial hair was slightly on the longer side........ Maybe  1/4 too 3/8 long it felt as it was pulling hair out when i used it with no guard.  &amp;#34;witch i always do with my other trimmer&amp;#34;  But i figured i would live with it and just make sure i don&#x27;t let my facial hair get that long.  Then i went to use it today and the battery was DEAD!  i used it two weeks prior and before the last use it was fully charged and maybe used it for an all of 5 minutes.  SO i figured it should have plenty or power today.  Well i was wrong.  Wouldn&#x27;t even turn on!  So i plugged it in to see if the quick charge would work...  That did work  after about 5 minutes i had enough to shave my face.  Though i can not count on this trimmer to hold  a charge.  Very disappointing!  I then went on to amazon to see if i can file for an exchange or return and i missed my deadline by a week.  Just be warned.</li>
    <li> My current beard trimmer is the [[ASIN:B003U8K6M6 Philips Norelco QT4050]] While it is not perfect (see my review), it is pretty easy to use and the vacuum feature is a plus. The Wahl 9867 doesn&#x27;t have a vacuum feature, but the trimming blades seem better made than the Philips and cut more cleanly. This model includes two additional heads, one with a small blade for \\&quot;detail\\&quot; work (such as a moustache), and one that is actually a small shaver. I do have several problems with the 9867, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The interchangeable heads are tricky to remove and replace. Removing isn&#x27;t that big a deal - just push up on the front with your thumb, but I struggle to replace the head as it always seems to want to go on crooked.&lt;br /&gt;- Two plastic combs are provided, but the instructions don&#x27;t suggest when you&#x27;d want to use one or the other. I found with the standard comb that the depth of cut varied depending on the angle at which I held the trimmer. The other comb has protective teeth that space the front of the blade out and make this less of a problem.&lt;br /&gt;- The blade comb depth adjustment locks well, but has irregular spacing. I found I wanted a depth between two settings.&lt;br /&gt;- The blades require occasional oiling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did like that a storage pouch was included, as was a small comb and cleaning brush. The power supply is small but runs warm. There is a stand you can use either while charging or not. The instruction leaflet is printed in microscopic type requiring a magnifying glass to read.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good trimmer. Unlike the blade guards that cap in, this built in sliding guard is a little tricky for trimming on any other setting that us not the lowest one. There is a gap between the trimming blades and the guard on higher settings. If you hand moves to far up you&#x27;ll get buzzed by the blade. I learned that the hard way.</li>
    <li> This is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve had since the fist generation maverick. Worth it.</li>
    <li> I like this trimmer, I just only wish it came with the separate gaurds as the adjustable one it has is not as precise as the other style. But the trimmer blades cut precise, and are tight/close together. Trims well.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality.  Works great.  The different attachments are very useful.</li>
    <li> Keeps charge well and plenty of power for all trimming needs.  Don&#x27;t really like the adjustment comb.  Not fine enough for my needs.</li>
    <li> Great item for beard grooming!  This is one of the best models of personal trimmers I have ever found.  The guards lock in place and provide great, precise trimming.  The only complaint that I have is that the nose hair trimmer does not come standard---you can order it as a separate item.</li>
    <li> I have had this trimmer for 3 months. After the first month, beyond return date, I noticed it would not hold a charge more that a few minutes. It continually got worse to where is now is totally dead! I am awaiting word from Wahl as to their return policy. I would not recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace an older model ([[ASIN:B001IDZHY2 Wahl Beard Trimmer]]) that I had picked up at Target some time ago. I wish I had shopped Amazon at the time, as all of the negative reviews are spot on. This model is a pleasure to use in comparison...  The adjustable comb means you are far less likely to use parts. The battery is strong enough that hair is cut, and not torn; and it holds a charge for multiple uses. (I&#x27;m an infrequent trimmer/shaver, so my ability to shave 3 times in 3 weeks without a recharge may mean little.) The travel case is a nice addition.  I&#x27;m not a fan of the shaving foil and am removing 1 star for it&#x27;s performance; and I feel that the detail trimmer is a bit superfluous- I can accomplish the same with the default trimmer. I do not miss the lack of a nose/hair trimmer as I prefer a dedicated one I picked up elsewhere.  Overall, a great buy.</li>
    <li> As another reviewer mentioned on the Beard &amp; Stubble version of this trimmer, this is a great and powerful little trimmer with really long lasting lithium ion battery.  This expanded version of the kit also features the detail trimmer which I like for cleaning out and around my goatee and the mini-shaver which works good for cleaning up in and around my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Beard Trimmer, Detail trimmer and Mini-Shaver lets you get the style you want&lt;br /&gt;REALLY strong motor&lt;br /&gt;Cuts really fine / accurate down to stubble&lt;br /&gt;Light weight and compact - perfect for travelers / campers.&lt;br /&gt;Great intuitive and minimalistic fittings for ALL your cutting needs.&lt;br /&gt;Lock switch :)&lt;br /&gt;Very nice to hold - great ergonomics&lt;br /&gt;Lithium charges very fast and lasts for ever - what more do u want?</li>
    <li> This unit is almost identical to other Wahl trimmers I&#x27;ve owned. The primary difference is that this one is missing some of the attachments I like  best and adds an adjustable  clipper guard for the small clipper head.  This addition of the adjustable clip guard is good news since now you don&#x27;t need a dozen guards in the drawer.  However, I wish it came with the larger clipper attachment and a guard to match.  My other Wahl&#x27;s attachments fit fine on this unit, but without the larger guard it&#x27;s hard to get the benefits of this one with the older larger clipper head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Powerful!&lt;br /&gt;- Charges fast and runs long.&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to switch attachments.&lt;br /&gt;- Adjustable clipper guard instead of a dozen clip on ones.&lt;br /&gt;- Built well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Missing the larger clipper blade and guards found on some Wahl trimmers&lt;br /&gt;- Has the flat style nose/ear trimmer.  I prefer the round one.&lt;br /&gt;- Foil shaver is similar to the others that have never worked well for me.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a Christmas gift to my fiance. He says it works well. He seems to like it. However,  it doesn&#x27;t have many options to pick the best length. He shaves his hair shorter than the usual now, because the next length is too long. Over all, we r happy with purchase. It has a better quality than the others shavers he had in the past.</li>
    <li> Best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had. Plenty of power, battery lasts forever. I highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
    <li> My husband loves! It works as advertised!</li>
    <li> This Wahl trimmer works pretty well, but I feel like it&#x27;s trying to be too many things. When trimmers start to include multiple heads for various purposes, I feel like they start to become a bit gimmicky. And the chance that something will break seems to increase, too. That said, the power of this trimmer is very good. It cuts cleanly and lasts a long time on a charge. I also like the carrying pouch. It probably cost Wahl all of (maybe) 25 cents, but it&#x27;s a nice addition. I have to agree with the one reviewer who mentioned being confused about the two adjustable combs that are included. I took a big chunk out of my beard the first time I tried this thing because I used the comb that looked like the one that comes with most beard trimmers. But I held the thing at the wrong angle and... KERCHUNK! Had to shave my whole face after that. I&#x27;ve since discovered that the comb that&#x27;s \\&quot;L\\&quot; shaped (or at least kind of \\&quot;L\\&quot; shaped) is the one I should use. But like the other reviewer stated, there&#x27;s NOTHING in the instructions about which comb to use for what. I *still* don&#x27;t know why there are two combs! I&#x27;ll give this thing 3.5 stars. If it were up to me, it would just come with the comb for trimming your beard. Sometimes less is more.</li>
    <li> I like the size of the blade. It&#x27;s small so that you can get to hard to reach places. All of the attachments work really well. Gives you a nice clean shave. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that sometimes it feels like it&#x27;s pulling at your skin. Nothing too bad. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Wahl has been making hair clippers since 1916 or thereabouts. As a kid, I remember being fascinated by the huge (to a child’s eyes) Wahl clippers hanging in the rack at the barber. Being a kid, I got the 10-minute haircut and they never used all those clippers on me, much to my disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Now I have a Wahl trimmer. My first issue, admittedly minor, is that the supplied trimmer heads are different than what is pictured. I didn’t get the turbo head. Instead, there was a different detail head, which doesn’t bother me in the least – since I haven’t shaved my entire face (which is what the rotary head seems to be for) for something close to fifty years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My second issue is with the instructions. They are bare bones and don’t really tell you much about using the one oddly shaped comb and the detailer heads. Again, not a big problem, because there is plenty of stuff on the web.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In terms of ease of use, it is a solid performer. Wahl offers a five year warranty for good reason – their stuff has always been top notch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The unit is intended as a trimmer for facial and body hair: it is not intended for cutting the hair on your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The battery charges quickly. I have not been able to determine standby time, but there is a “charge 1 minute, run for 3” feature which seems to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The design is ergonomically sound. The unit can be used in either hand and is flexible for trimming behind the ears, under the chin and those wisps that stick out on the sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The super-detailer is a very narrow blade intended for trimming nose and ear hair. Wahl has an inexpensive (until you add the shipping) rotary cutter which some might prefer. I haven’t made up my mind on this one yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Two combs are delivered with the unit. One has upward projections which puzzled me at first and then I realized it acted as a comb when trimming the beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I’ve been using a Panasonic beard trimmer for years and am quite happy with its single blade and adjustable hood. The Wahl 9867-300, by comparison, is far more versatile, maybe more versatile than I’m comfortable with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Beard trimming isn’t a daily task for me, so it will take me a while until I form an solid opinion. Until then, I’d comfortably give this a 4 star rating.If Wahl did more to help demonstrate proper use of their beard trimmer, it would be appreciated,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jerrybeard trimmer for years and am quite happy with its single blade and adjustable hood.

    <li> This is my third beard trimmer and I won’t even mention my first one since it was an antique (not really but it was more than a decade old). My other trimmer is the Remington MB4040 Lithium Ion. Between the two the Wahl trimmer is smaller, sleeker, more attractive and fits in my hand better. One big difference between the Wahl trimmer and my other two is that the plastic guard on my other two trimmers was basically a cage making them idiot proof. Not so with the Wahl guard which is open on one side so if you hold the trimmer wrong you can shave right down to the skin, which is precisely what I did the first time I used it. So my first experience with the All-in-One trimmer was to shave off my entire beard after putting a sizable divot in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three things I prefer about my Remington; first, the power button and guard adjuster dial are on the same side of the trimmer so I don’t have to flip it over. This may sound trivial but it’s what I prefer. Second, there is a little light on my Remington to show when it’s getting power through the cord unlike the Wahl. Third, the Remington is almost $10 cheaper. The Wahl has a little switch to lock the beard guard in place which is nice although it was never something I thought my other trimmers were lacking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may need more time with the trimmer and I might revisit this review but I’m leaning towards the Wahl as the better trimming experience once you learn how NOT to hold it. The All-in-One trimmer’s slightly smaller size makes it more portable for trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW: One thing I learned. I accidently plugged my Wahl trimmer in using my Remington charger which fit just fine but next time I tried to use the Wahl trimmer it was dead as if the charger sucked up the energy rather than charging it. After plugging in the correct charger it worked fine.</li>
    <li> I have very thick beard hairs. I think what they tried to do with this clipper is make it very light. In order to do that they made the motor operate at a VERY fast speed. However, it&#x27;s is still a small motor and doesn&#x27;t have a lot of torque behind it. The result of this is that my very thick beard hair sometimes bogs down the clipper and it catches my hair and that hurts, a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, for very light maintenance it works well. The rechargeable battery and the light weight make it a pleasure to use. The 8 position levels for the plastic guides is nice and can let you achieve any length look you&#x27;re looking for. For my scalp, where my hair is sadly a lot thinner than my beard, this clipper works pretty well though it can bog down there too if you move it too fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;d go with 5 stars for light trimming/shaping of thin hair and 1 star for heavy cutting of thick hair, averaged it out to a 3. If you often have the need to dig into thick beard hair you&#x27;ll probably need a separate trimmer that plugs in, is a lot heaver, and applies much more torque to the cutting blade.</li>
    <li> I have bought several Wahl trimmers over the years, and this may be the best of them.  Whether it is worth the extra money will depend on your needs and priorities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the trimmer itself seems well-made, and there are some details which were well thought out.  For example, striated rubber strips on either side of the trimmer are comfortable to hold and make it less likely to slip out of your hand.  Also, I had problems with previous trimmers getting turned on in my luggage, but the power switch on this thing is not likely to get turned on accidentally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mostly like the guide comb -- it is a lot handier than a pile of snap-on combs. The lock, quickly engaged/released with your thumb, keeps the guide firmly in place. The one problem I have with the guide is that the increments are too large at the short end -- in particular you go from about 1/8 inch to 1/4 inch, and I often find myself wishing I could do something in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it harder to change heads than I would have expected.  Getting a head *off* is very easy: you just push up against the blade with your thumb and the head pops off.  Putting a head *on* is trickier; I have trouble getting things lined up properly.  But I found that if you put the head down on a flat surface and then slide the trimmer underneath the end of it and then push down, you can usually get it in one or two tries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real reason I expect anyone would want this particular trimmer is the additional heads.  I have a kind of van dyke beard with some areas cut out, and those cutouts are hard to do with a razor.  I bought the Merkur Moustache and Eyebrow Razor, which looked like it would be just the ticket, but the blades are worthless -- it felt like scraping hairs off with a spoon.  So this trimmer is my new solution.  The precision detailer doesn&#x27;t get the hairs short enough for a good look, so I just use it to shape things and then use the shaver to get down to the skin.  For some reason my shaver is not dual-head, but a single head is probably better for me since I&#x27;m working in a small space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it gets the job done, so I&#x27;m happy.  And the battery holds a charge well, although honestly I prefer units that take a couple of rechargeable AA batteries, because when these built-in batteries give out the trimmer is useless.  If I get a couple of years out of this one, I&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
    <li> This does a good job on facial area (cheeks, chin, jowls), but does not handle the neck well - unless you want to walk around with lots of little bits of tissue stuck to your neck. It is much too harsh for the neck area; sort of like it is taking little bites out of you instead of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the face, it does really well at keeping your &#x27;scruff&#x27; at the level you want. It also does an excellent job of a clean shave. Seems pretty durable and has the right accessories with the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wahl is a name that our family has trusted for many years. I was sorry to give only a three-star rating, but with it not doing well on the neck, that is what it gets.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend did the review for this for me, as I am female and am not yet ready to shave my head for review purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He says that he used this primarily as a beard trimmer. He&#x27;s been using Wahls for years, probably fifteen or more. This one is the same size as all the beard / mustache trimmers that they&#x27;ve had in the past, but it seems like it has a better battery. So for that reason alone, with all the other standard features, it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He hasn&#x27;t really used the shaver head because it would be too small to do a whole face with. It&#x27;s not really meant for that, being a trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a raiseable guard with a bit of flex to it. This can be less than great if you&#x27;re aiming for a quite accurate trim and apply a bit of pressure to it. Something to be cautious about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a great addition to the Wahl line and it does its job well.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;I have had various trimmers before but trimming my beard has always been too free form for my taste. I like to be able to vary the length of the hairs depending upon where on my face and neck they appear.&lt;br /&gt;That was never possible to do right until I tried this item. The adjustable length attachments are just the thing to cut my facial hair to just the right length time after time.&lt;br /&gt;I have read comments that this unit doesn&#x27;t cut like a shaver. No trimmer I have ever used does. Electric razors are designed to give smooth shaves all the way down to the skin. Trimmers are NOT designed to do this. I have always had to use my shaver after trimming to get smooth skin where I don&#x27;t want any hair at all and with this unit I still do. Not a big job to do since this trimmer does cut very close to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;So no more free form sculpting disasters for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative comment I have at all is that the user guide is virtually useless. If you want to know how the various attachments and heads work you will just have to play with them until you figure out how they work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will definitely enjoy grooming your beard with this little number. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Hello everyone,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still trying to find out what I should be missing here but the fact is, this is a pretty fine machine mechanically speaking but that system of guides it has... I can&#x27;t simply get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This machine comes with everything you might need but this very advert page here in Amazon has better/more documentation than the product itself. Wahl people, you can improve here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery really lasts, feels very well built, my major complaints are I don&#x27;t know how to use this kind of guides. I have another trimmer with standard snap-on guides and it works ok but this one... I need to master it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JP</li>
    <li> Wahl once again lives up to it&#x27;s reputation.  This is a great little trimmer, nice design and holds charge.  He likes the way it works and I like the look and feel after!  Would be a good gift item, packaged nicely in a box not a cheap plastic clamshell.  Wahl products are good for hair clippers, pet clippers, etc.  Very reliable brand.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best trimmer I&#x27;ve had in ages. I LOVE the way the guide works - I can&#x27;t believe no one has thought of this before. I have always hated all the trimmer attachments that these trimmers usually have because it&#x27;s always so difficult to read the lengths and then you have to store them and find them etc, etc. This trimmer attachment is directly attached to the shaver and it clicks up in ¼&amp;#34; intervals. Makes total sense and is easy to use. You do have to be a little careful to not press down too much or it will click down while trimming, but it&#x27;s not a big deal and you can just be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the one to get.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t trim my beard or hair cleanly. Takes 8-10 passes to get it as close and clean as my old clippers.</li>
