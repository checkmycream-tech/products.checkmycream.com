      <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
      <li>nice product.  </li>

      <li>Excellent product and service, at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Very smooth, low-smell, and nice texture.</li>
      <li>That being said, the Lanolin Butter is a very good product and a good replacement for the product my pharmacist can no long supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am so glad I bought this product.</li>
      <li>How&#x27;s that for five more words?</li>
      <li>I love this product...</li>
      <li>On top of that smell it also smells like iodine like medicine ( I don&#x27;t know why they added iodine to this product).</li>
      <li>Thanks for offering a great product.</li>
      <li>My children love it because it doesn&#x27;t burn...</li>
      <li>What more can you ask for?</li>
      <li>but seems to work better</li>
      <li>I am not 100% sure I would use this for breastfeeding (probably would still go with Lansnoh for that, esp.</li>
      <li>I love the benefits of lanolin.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure you will be using it all over the place.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite skin care product of all time.</li>
      <li>Will order more when this batch runs out.</li>
      <li>: - )</li>
      <li>You get more bang for your buck.  </li>
      <li>My favorite lanolin ever.</li>
      <li>Let it cool, and you get a product that soaks into the skin even better!</li>
      <li>But if you have dry skin anywhere--- hands, legs, shoulders--- it&#x27;s the best.</li>
      <li>So I was delighted to find a cleaner version of pure lanolin.</li>
      <li>This product is good for many things but for this main reason for this purchase it seems to be doing what we were hoping it would do</li>
      <li>This is nice fresh lanolin, nothing added.</li>
      <li>great stuff, will buy more later.</li>
      <li>I melts easily and there is no odor.</li>
      <li>Great quality, nice and creamy texture, smooth and just what I expected, just like what I get from my soap making supplier.</li>
      <li>It serves its purpose just fine though.</li>
      <li>since I&#x27;d be more careful about what my infant ingests, but I wanted a large amount for lanolizing wool diaper covers and making my own diaper rash cream, so this is a great value.</li>
      <li>to the vendor for making this available.</li>
      <li>It of good quality as far as I can tell.</li>
      <li>This product is sans most of the &amp;#34;sheep grease&amp;#34; odor we had experienced with other anhydrous lanolins we had used over the years.  </li>
      <li>super easy to do</li>
      <li>I purchased this because I was interested in using all natural products for my hair a skin, great for skin protection.</li>
      <li>I do not use it for cosmetic applications, but have tried it and put it on my feet and works great on dry skin.</li>
      <li>it is safe to use because it&#x27;s just pure lanolin</li>
      <li>Low pleasant odor adequate for lip balm, protectant, skin softening.  </li>
      <li>I have a feeling that this is the real thing, but more info is needed to convince me that this item is what I am looking for.&lt;br /&gt;dtschak</li>
      <li>/&gt;We have done many miles of whitewater canoe camping in Alaska and the Yukon Territory as well as Northern New England.</li>
      <li>The deodorizing and refining process make this lanolin much more useful than normal lanolin.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t know that real lanolin smells so strong and even though they say that this one is purified etc.</li>
      <li>Lanolin is a wonderful natural emollient to eliminate dry skin, It&#x27;s just so very sticky for hand use.</li>
      <li>This was cheaper for a true pound and was a bit more fluid and easier both to spread and to melt into the skin.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Too slimey .Other stuff has apparently been added (I am a pharmacist) and the result is a bad product ,period..</li>
    <li> Finally a lanolin that does not smell faintly like mutton. BTW, I like mutton, but my wife does not. So I was delighted to find a cleaner version of pure lanolin. very thick consistency. Stickier than lotions. But it lasts and lasts. I order a new one every couple years. A little goes a long way. My happy butter.(BTW, it is too sticky to be used as a personal lube...Oooow. )  : - )</li>
    <li> I have used this product for five years and won&#x27;t buy any other brand of lanolin. USP pure, perfect for homemade soap or cosmetics. Great hair conditioner and moisturizer. Small amount goes a long way. This merchant sells an excellent product.</li>
    <li> I use this product for making hand cream.  I melts easily and there is no odor. Try making your own hand cream.</li>
    <li> This is a great price for this product. As a matter of fact, for anyone who wants to reload with steel dies you can mix a 1:1 ratio of this with castor oil and have a killer die lube. I plan to use it with my 50 AE and when I swage and start pressing my own bullets this is good to use on the jackets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the vendor for making this available. I am looking forward to buying more in the future.</li>
    <li> The product is performing as I expected.  Will order more when this batch runs out. Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  How&#x27;s that for five more words?</li>
    <li> I am having difficulty understanding just what this item contains.  It says \\&quot;Lanolin (anhydrous) - Ultra Refined Butter 1 lb\\&quot;  But, what does that mean? Of course, I understand what anhydrous means.  \\&quot;Ultra Refined\\&quot; - One can assume this means \\&quot;very clean\\&quot;.  But, what does \\&quot;Butter\\&quot; mean.  I would like to see something like \\&quot;100% pure anhydrous Lanolin\\&quot; in the description. Is butter a mixture of lanolin and something else?  If so, what else is in it and what are the percentages.  If it is pure lanolin, then I would buy it,  but if it is just a mixture of lanolin and something else, I am a bit worried.  I checked various sites on the Internet, but could not answer my questions.  I have a feeling that this is the real thing, but more info is needed to convince me that this item is what I am looking for.&lt;br /&gt;dtschak</li>
    <li> Pure lanolin - perfect for keeping your feet from getting hard and calloused!  Also works on my kid&#x27;s eczema.  Great price.</li>
    <li> Cheap and excellent for an overnight eye cream--prevents wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Yes I know it is greasy, but that is lanolin, and this is what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Little did know how sticky this is. That&#x27;s the nature of lanolin. I guess the best use for it for me will be to use on my feet and wear a pair of cotton socks over my feet to bed. It will help to make the oil penetrae in a much less sticky way. Lanolin is a wonderful natural emollient to eliminate dry skin, It&#x27;s just so very sticky for hand use. I tried using cotton gloves but the gloves drove me crazy. The socks not so much. I tried the various lanolin creams and they are so over powering scented with sickenly sweet with a honeysuckle fragrance they made me sick. I am not one to react to any fragrance.</li>
    <li> I have purchased lanolin before.  The &amp;#34;ultra refined&amp;#34; Saaquin lanolin &amp;#34;butter&amp;#34; is lighter in color and has a pungent, chemical smell, compared to natural lanolin.  I&#x27;m using this for rust-proofing metal parts, but I would not use it on my skin or for cosmetics.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping. The pure lanolin is awesome. It mixes well with other product to create lip balm, hair grease or can use alone. I split the container so half is for mixing and other half I use for breast feeding. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Great price! I needed lanolin in large quantities for waterproofing my wool diaper covers, and for a few other uses. This is nice fresh lanolin, nothing added. Wonderful! Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I was interested in using all natural products for my hair a skin, great for skin protection. My daughter has natural hair and used it to twist her hair, after she washed it, used the lanolin butter, let her hair dry any would have beautiful wavy coil that would stay for days, those of you who have textured hair this is a good product. A dab goes a long way.</li>
    <li> the best product for sealing the skin after it has been moisturized. no residual smell like a lot of other anhydrous lanolin products.</li>
    <li> good to use as a night cream. But I have a oil skin, so I use this with some essential oil on my body. It helps a lot. I like it. and the seller was very nice. even the shipping got some problem, but the seller helps me a lot.Thank U!</li>
    <li> I got this for my wool diaper covers. it works like a charm. No more leaks !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its super easy to do and I still have so much left.</li>
    <li> Excellent  product softens foot callouses. For daily use after shower and prep for taking steps without pain or discomfort. Yes</li>
    <li> Seems good, a much better value than the Lansinoh tubes. I am not 100% sure I would use this for breastfeeding (probably would still go with Lansnoh for that, esp. since you don&#x27;t need much for breastfeeding) since I&#x27;d be more careful about what my infant ingests, but I wanted a large amount for lanolizing wool diaper covers and making my own diaper rash cream, so this is a great value.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! Thank you. Excellent product and service, at a reasonable price. Love my Lanolin!</li>
    <li> People complain about the scent. I bought a bottle of scented oil here on Amazon (sold for candle making, but approved for bath and body applications). I left the tub of lanolin in the sun for half a day and it melted to liquid. I mixed in the scented oil (half a bottle...see my other reviews for the supplier) really well. Now, it smells like vanilla cake. Problem solved. I use it on my hands, feet, lips, knees, elbows, cuticles...anywhere I have dry skin or cracks. A little goes a long way and the addition of the scented oil makes it easier to spread around (it can be a bit stiff until your body heat melts it a bit). I have been buying the little purple tubes at Target (Lanisoh brand marketed for nursing mothers) since I had my first kid (20 years ago). Ten bucks a tiny tube!!!!!! This is SUCH a better deal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands of lanolin before.  This was cheaper for a true pound and was a bit more fluid and easier both to spread and to melt into the skin.  Helped calm things down a good bit on my dry skin.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I bought this product. There is a lot there so it should probably last me the rest of my life but it is my favorite thing to use on dry chapped skin! I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a lot of quality lanolin butter!</li>
    <li> I have used only Lansinoh brand Lanolin before but decided to buy this brand because I&#x27;m using it for my son&#x27;s diaper rash and on my feet to soften them. I didn&#x27;t know that real lanolin smells so strong and even though they say that this one is purified etc. it smell like a lamb. On top of that smell it also smells like iodine like medicine ( I don&#x27;t know why they added iodine to this product). So I just have to get used to it because as a moisturizer it acts superb.</li>
    <li> Works really well - has a slight smell to the product but dissipates after a little while. Much harder to put on compared to other moisturing products such as Eucerin or Aquaphor but seems to work better</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t figured out how to mix it with another lotion yet, but I&#x27;m working on it.  My skin just loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> Product came expediently and was well packaged. I used the lanolin for a homemade salve I was making and the results were great. I thought the product was high quality, just what I was needing.</li>
    <li> I have only one word for this product. Gross. It&#x27;s sticky, gummy, stains and is not easy to use.</li>
    <li> This product has been a wonderful success in keeping my diabetic feet in good shape. It is a product that lasts well to make my otherwise painful feet comfortable. I also use this on elbows, knees and any rough patches with tremendous success. My need for such a product outweighs it&#x27;s form. You will find this product to be heavy, stiff and sticky. The stickiness subsides into smoothness and you&#x27;ll have to wait it out. My 62 year old hands have never looked better, younger. While it&#x27;s form may not be to everyone&#x27;s liking - the outcome is worth it, especially if you have tried everything else. There is NO scent.</li>
    <li> This smells a bit stronger than other lanolin that I&#x27;ve bought for my diapers before. It serves its purpose just fine though. I thought that ultra refined meant also deodorized...I was wrong</li>
    <li> I am a &amp;#34;hands on&amp;#34; maker of things.  This lanolin is the best treatment for keeping digits healthy and working well!&lt;br /&gt;In addition If you rub it onto your hands prior to painting, gardening, woodworking, metal working or working on an engine, for example, you will find that it&#x27;s much easier to clean your hands afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;We have done many miles of whitewater canoe camping in Alaska and the Yukon Territory as well as Northern New England. Hands and fingers are much happier when a day on the water starts and ends with an application of this Lanolin.  This product is sans most of the &amp;#34;sheep grease&amp;#34; odor we had experienced with other anhydrous lanolins we had used over the years.  We have introduced this lanolin to many friends who have been instantly converted from whatever creams or lotions the had tried previously.&lt;br /&gt;It is very stiff at cool temps so keep a small container full close to your core to keep it warm for easier application.  It&#x27;s sticky at first, but just rub it in and that will resolve.&lt;br /&gt;This also works well to soothe and heal any chafed or abraded areas of cheeks, elbows, lips, etc.&lt;br /&gt;......it can be used as a very effective anti-corrosion barrier to protect hand tools&lt;br /&gt;......it is safe to use because it&#x27;s just pure lanolin...contains no petroleum, other chemicals etc.&lt;br /&gt;......we highly recommended this for anyone working with their hands</li>
    <li> I have never purchased lanolin before, so I really don&#x27;t know what to compare it to. However, this seems to be of very good quality.  I made some lotion with this recently and it turned out very well.&lt;br /&gt;A few things on the product itself:&lt;br /&gt;-For the price, it is a very good portion.&lt;br /&gt;-It has a distinctive smell, but it doesn&#x27;t by any means smell bad.&lt;br /&gt;-It is a bit sticky, so it&#x27;s not recommended to use the product on it&#x27;s own.  A very small bit of it works well on chapped lips.  It did for me at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would recommend this to anyone making their own beauty products.  It of good quality as far as I can tell.</li>
    <li> Perfect,on time,exactly what i thought</li>
    <li> Excellent product and price.  A pound if lanolin is a lot!  Low pleasant odor adequate for lip balm, protectant, skin softening.  Not as pure as the brand in the small pink tube, used for breastfeeding, based on lower odor and lighter color.  As this product is not USP listed I would check before using it for nipple protectant while breastfeeding.</li>
    <li> I have ultra dry skin, and this helps create a barrier and hold in moisture.  They key is to use sparingly.  It can be really thick ad sticky.  The scent is really not that bad. Great on lips too!</li>
    <li> I bought this to lanolize my diapers.  It worked well, too bad the covers did not fit him properly.  You get more bang for your buck.  I did not want to spend twice as much for a few ounces when I could by 1 lb way cheaper.</li>
    <li> Very nice product for balms and lotions.</li>
    <li> great stuff, will buy more later. hard to find stuff, this is to  much trouble to do with the extra  words, I wont do any more</li>
    <li> I love the benefits of lanolin.  I use for diaper rash, dry lips and skin. My children love it because it doesn&#x27;t burn...as lotions and other products tend to do when applied to super inflamed skin.  I was spending $10 for a little purple tube of lanolin.  As we always keep some on hand and use nearly daily, we go through a lot of it.  I had to snatch up this product...1 pd for only $12! I love this product...pure lanolin and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> When I received the product, it did not state the ingredients. I contacted the company and found out that this is deodorized ultra refined 100% pure lanolin. The deodorizing and refining process make this lanolin much more useful than normal lanolin. They further clarified that there is no added fragrance. They just remove the \\&quot;lanolin\\&quot; smell. This is great for me--easy to spread lanolin without the barn yard smell. Much better than regular lanolin on my lips too.</li>
    <li> I am a nurse and my hands take a beating with all the hand washing I do.  I apply this to my hands at night and wear cotton gloves.  It is the only thing that keeps my hands from cracking and bleeding.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Not terribly easy to run on, since it&#x27;s not really creamy. But if you have dry skin anywhere--- hands, legs, shoulders--- it&#x27;s the best. Other moisturizers are mostly water: they evaporate and the problem is there again. This goo is the stuff that makes lambs soft; it&#x27;s natural, and it does the job better than anything else.</li>
    <li> I had used USP grade lanolin for years as a moisturizer; the stuff works well, but it takes forever to soak into the skin (leaves a persistent tackiness and greasiness), and it smells awful. I recently read that a thing called refined lanolin (purified, not sure by what process) existed, and bought a tub of this stuff.  First, this product has little odor - you&#x27;d need to slather your hands heavily for anyone to be able to get a hint; this is in contrast to regular lanolin, which would have people wondering what you&#x27;d been doing if you rubbed a little onto a hangnail.  Secondly, it is a little less viscous than regular lanolin, absorbs into the skin better, and does not leave residual tackiness (if you overdo it there is a little silky greasiness).  This is my favorite skin care product of all time. I&#x27;ve had my tub of it at work all week, and have been sharing it with anyone who will let me slather it on their hands. I only regret that I didn&#x27;t discover the stuff many years ago...  I found out how to make this work even better - hydrating it! I put a no-more-than-2/3-full jar of it in the microwave and give it small increment zaps until it is completely melted. I then start adding small (no more than 5-10% of volume at once) increments of water to it and stirring thoroughly - until it is the color of butter. Let it cool, and you get a product that soaks into the skin even better! I&#x27;ve bought small jars (2-4 oz) and have poured it into these when melted, and have a terrific gift !</li>
    <li> Nice product and great price</li>
    <li> Pure lanolin doesn&#x27;t smell too nice...used as an ingredient in cosmetics, etc and therefore it is usually scented. I do not use it for cosmetic applications, but have tried it and put it on my feet and works great on dry skin.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item a couple weeks back now, and I must say the quality and value of the product exceeded my expectations. I should add that initially I contacted the seller to clarify that it was indeed 100% lanolin, seeing as the description was rather vague. Anyway, it is 100% Lanolin and I will definitely be ordering from this seller in the future. Thanks for offering a great product.</li>
    <li> My favorite lanolin ever. You get a lot and the stuff is pure but not as sticky as petroleum jelly would be in a similar grade. Very smooth, low-smell, and nice texture.</li>
    <li> I used the lanolin to polish and protect the leather dash and seats in my car. It did the job.</li>
    <li> This was every thing I hope for very very and will order again this is a good company the prices are good&lt;br /&gt;I got what I paid for</li>
    <li> It is what it is. Comes in a little plastic tub. Sticky and greasy at the same time. A little thicker than I expected, but that&#x27;s not an issue. What more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> When I find this product I purchase several pounds each time.  I&#x27;ve been buying from my pharmacist for a few years and he charged me $37 per jar.  The product from my pharmacist was not a lanolin butter, but pure anhydrous lanolin.  The lanolin butter product is much thinner than the very dense product I purchased from my pharmacist.  That being said, the Lanolin Butter is a very good product and a good replacement for the product my pharmacist can no long supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 7 21 2014&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for years but have just now realized I can use this lanolin on my lips like chapstick or Carmex.  This stuff is great and will actually stay on you lips, even through an entire night of sleep.  I sure would have saved myself some money if I realized this earlier.  You can even mix in essential oils or mix with cosmetic pigments for the lips.  I mix mine with tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> nice product.  I wanted to try this for making hand lotion and it will serve my purposes well.  1321 kjg</li>
    <li> I use this everyday. I love it !</li>
    <li> I was a bit hesitant to order this product, since the product description was a bit vague. However, I decided to give it a try, and I am very satisfied. The value can&#x27;t be beat either!</li>
    <li> I originally bought this for one reason, but now I have found at least five other useages.  Buy it and I&#x27;m sure you will be using it all over the place.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST!  I use it on my feet at night.  The lanolin moisturizes them so they are &amp;#34;baby soft&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Love this product!! Helps to heal and protect skin. Good for lips, face, hands, elbows, and any where you want to put it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Comes packaged very well. Always &amp;#34;filled&amp;#34; with the appropriate amount..have had problems with other companies(with that issue) but never this one.</li>
    <li> Makes my beard silky smooth and smelling ever so faintly of a goat, which makes me feel more masculine in spite of the silky-smooth thing. It really does have a hint of musk (duh, it&#x27;s sheep sebum) but DON&#x27;T be put off; it&#x27;s mild and quite pleasant. Best balm for chapped skin ever. It&#x27;s kind of like petroleum jelly, but biologically sourced and without the petroleum. Win.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Works great in making my soaps and creams.</li>
    <li> This product is good for many things but for this main reason for this purchase it seems to be doing what we were hoping it would do and it is very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You&lt;br /&gt;Elaine V. Swem</li>
    <li> Great quality, nice and creamy texture, smooth and just what I expected, just like what I get from my soap making supplier.</li>
