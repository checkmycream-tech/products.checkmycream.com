    <li> I received the wrong item twice.  Not sure why.</li>
    <li> I have used this for about a year. It makes your face feel really healthyand  really clean (but not  stripped) including eye makeup. I would  recommend it to anyone with over 50 skin or maybe even under 50 skin.  It was recommended to me by my esthetician. A really good skin cleaner.</li>
    <li> I Love Skin care Product, it clean off makeup off leaving your skin feeling great, help with break outs too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your skin will improve each morning you get up, and you will see the differents.</li>
    <li> Great product!! It&#x27;s the only cleanser that really works!!  My cosmetician friend recommended it to me, and I haven&#x27;t stopped using it since then!!</li>
    <li> I like to change up my cleansers. I alternate this with the Vital C and Ormedic cleansers. Gives me good results!</li>
    <li> IT WAS PERFECT JUST WHAT I WANTED THANK YOU</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year now and recently started using it with a Clarisonic facial cleanser and I love it!</li>
    <li> Just a pea size amount goes a long way! Cleans well doesn&#x27;t irritate at all! Does not seem to dry my skin either!</li>
    <li> After spending lots of money on this line at my cosmetologist, I found this here. I remember long time ago this line could be sold only by professionals, so I was surprised to find it online... It works well.</li>
    <li> Expensive but valuable product. My face always feels clean and clear.  My pores are noticeably smaller. Not sure what more to say.</li>
    <li> I still like Image Skin Care Vital C Hydrating Facial Cleanser Better. I don&#x27;t think I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great and cleans my skin really well. It leaves my skin looking really clean, bright and younger!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for one year and love the Ageless product line. This cleanser can be used in the morning and evening for an overall excellent clean facial care.</li>

Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> the best cleanser ever! I highly recommend this product! Leaves skin very smooth and hydrated and also removes stubborn make-up!</li>
    <li> I use this cleanser and the Vital C cleanser.  I just switch between the two whenever I feel like it. I have many of the Image Skincare products because this line is fabulous! I am 49 years old and I have seen some very nice changes to my face, neck and chest area. Today I received the Cell.U.Lift firming body creme and can&#x27;t wait to start using that one so I don&#x27;t use my facial products on my arms and legs and butt. And yes the facial products have made a difference there too! But back to the image Skincare The Max Cleanser...wonderful product! Your face feels super-clean and refreshed after using it. It takes off your makeup very well. What I especially love about this cleanser is that a little goes a very long way! I will certainly continue to buy this, well heck I just received another one today along with the Cell.U.Lift (which is a big tube 5 fl oz.) and I also purchased the Ageless total retinol-A creme from Image. Anyway, buy this cleanser. You won&#x27;t regret it...I promise!</li>
    <li> Great product. Half the price of the retailers in town. I use the whole line of Image products and I find them to be beneficial to my skin.</li>
