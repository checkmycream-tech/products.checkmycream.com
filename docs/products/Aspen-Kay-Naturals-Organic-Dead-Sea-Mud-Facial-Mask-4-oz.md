<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love the way this mask feels and smells. It does leave me skin looking fresh and clear. I have large pores around my nose that I&#x27;ve always had to be careful with. Sometimes the mud gets trapped in there. This company has excellent customer service- I communicated by email with someone from the company who suggested techniques for making sure all the mud is cleared from my pores during washing. I&#x27;m giving this 5 stars for the product itself because it does work but also for the excellent customer service, which I really appreciate.</li>
    <li> This mask is the bomb! I absolutely love the natural, earthy scent, and it left my skin feeling super-soft and hydrated!</li>
    <li> My daughter &amp; I both agree that this mask smells horrible.  I&#x27;m usually not that picky about odors but we just can&#x27;t get past the unpleasant odor. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> Amazing. I just did my first Dead Sea Facial Mask from Aspens and the whole experience was luxurious. The product is so smooth and refreshing. The consistency is unlike any other face mask I&#x27;ve tried--it felt cool, light, loving, silky, rich and hydrating. I used like one-quarter of what I would normally use of another mask to cover my face so it looks like a HUGE bang for my buck. Organic, homemade, lasts longer--phenomenal. I will never go back to other brands. Thank you for taking great care to find such superb ingredients and handcrafting this. Pure gold for my face!</li>
    <li> This mask is great! It&#x27;s super easy to use in a non messy kind of way. I have others that I have to mix myself and I&#x27;m starting to reach for this one as my go-to. It washes off easily as well so you don&#x27;t have to sit there scrubbing your face with a washcloth to get it off. The ingredients are pure &amp; it has a lovely scent which is a major plus. Overall, I&#x27;m really pleased with the product!</li>
    <li> Having never used a mud mask before, I&#x27;m not sure what I expected, but this product seemed to do what I would have thought one might. I originally ordered this mud mask for my husband as he had a skin condition on his hand. In the meantime, he got another product for it that was already working, so when it arrived I ended up using it as a face mask, which is probably what it is most often used for anyhow. It seemed to tighten my skin and refresh it, and my face felt clean and invigorated afterwards. I&#x27;m not giving it five stars as it&#x27;s not a product I couldn&#x27;t live without, but I have enjoyed doing mini-facials with it so far.</li>
    <li> All right, guys, this stuff is incredible. My sister and I both use it, even though we have totally different skin types, and it works for both of us. It feels so refreshing, and is gentle but really helps your skin out. I will definitely want more when I run out, which will probably be in about 5 years so I hope it&#x27;s still being made. A little goes a long way with this mud mask.</li>
    <li> Disappointed on how small the container is</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already tried it and love it! I haven&#x27;t used a pack in years and they are much improved. I didn&#x27;t look like a gargoyle when I looked in the mirror and it didn&#x27;t flake all over the place. The smell I can put up with. Good job! And thanks.</li>
    <li> I have now used it twice and I really love how it makes my skin feel.  I have very (read ridiculously) sensitive skin and have not been able to use dead sea mud masks in the past. I do really like the lavender smell from the lavender essential oil. It is quite a strong smell, but pure lavender if that makes sense? Yes, I will be purchasing this product again when my supply gets low, this is now a part of my weekly skin care routine!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of Dead Sea masks over the years and one of the problems I always had was that they dried my face out and caused painful irritation. I&#x27;ve finally found a mud mask that leaves me feeling refreshed, clean and hydrated. This mask will leave you glowing and the fresh scent of the mud will make you feel like you&#x27;re at a spa. Just pour yourself a glass of cucumber ice water and spoil yourself with this awesome mud mask! See my before and after to see how much it evened my skin.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and makes my skin feel very soft. A great product!</li>
    <li> I love it , it leaves my face feeling clean and smooth, my first time trying it !!!!!!</li>
    <li> this is a very high quality mud mask, with a nice scent</li>
    <li> It does leave the skin soft and refresh, but I think it made me break out a little.I believed is because my skin is too sensitive, but honestly the skin  does look and feels better after applying. What I mean is that is worth it, and I will  buy it again. Although it might be a while because even though the bottle seems small the amount needed on each application is not much.</li>
    <li> This is nice natural mud mask. I didn&#x27;t experience any burning having it on, or mask residue after washing it off my face. It does have essential oils. So, you will smell some lavender, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me, since I&#x27;m used to the smell. I use this twice a week for soft skin, shrinking pores, and to look refresh. Don&#x27;t be caught off guard. It&#x27;s a small jar, but a lot of the product within the container. Great consistency and even out smooth on the face. You can tell the difference between this mask and store brought. No parabens, chemicals, or tested on animals.</li>
    <li> The mask arrived on-time and is absolutely WONDERFUL!!  I love it.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves it. Has a very strong smell and a little bit goes a long way so don&#x27;t be fooled by the size.</li>
    <li> Love this, it&#x27;s not gritty, applies smooth, smells nice and left my skin feeling super soft. I had a blemish on my hair line that was tender to the touch and almost non existent after applying this mask to it. Loving the ingredients as well!</li>
    <li> Oh wow this smells incredible. A little goes a long way. My skin is baby soft after using this wonderful mask. I am a face maskaholic and this is top notch. I am so happy that I picked this one. I noticed an improved skin tone after one use. Its also calming. I have a baby with colic and omg I.used this and had to fight to stay awake. This mask has everything in it that I was looking for...rosehip oil jobaba dead sea mud and more...lavender as well. As a woman whom.loves masks....u can&#x27;t go wrong with this. The only way you can go wrong is with not getting it!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that the jar was small. Seems to be working well. Just wish it was a bigger container for the money.</li>
    <li> Wonderful mask that makes your face feel CLEAN and look bright and poreless. I had purchased another brand from a department store previously for $62.00, and without a doubt, Aspen Naturals is every bit as good. I wish I still had the smaller jar I previously purchased because I don&#x27;t think its ingredients were organic. Awesome mask. Can&#x27;t wait to see the results after a week or two, as I&#x27;ve used it only once so far. What a great find!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this twice and I can see and feel the difference in my face. I love the results. I recommend this product only after two uses. Yes it&#x27;s that good.</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying a mud mask, and I was not sure what to expect. Wow! My face is baby soft and feels so clean! I loved the smell as well!</li>
    <li> I liked this mud mask as it didn&#x27;t make my face feel tight and uncomfortable.  It was easy to wash off and I felt my nasal passages open up.  It was pretty refreshing.  I like pampering myself with this kind of stuff and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. My skin felt great.</li>
    <li> I received this two days after I ordered it. The instructions on use are very clear and simple. I can feel the product working while it&#x27;s on my skin. When I washed it off my face my pores were spotless and my skin was so soft. I really enjoyed the scent of the natural oils. I will continue to use this product a couple of times a week. I am so happy I found this!!!</li>
    <li> Used this for the first time tonight.  I have very sensitive skin and I really, really like this mask.  My skin felt soft and smooth.  Excellent ingredients.  Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Oh my god this stuff is heaven in a jar!&lt;br /&gt;It smells wonderful ( just a hint of lavender) but it doesn&#x27;t burn me or give me a headache. It feels buttery on my skin and if you rub it off once it&#x27;s dry it exfoliates so well. I typically have very sensitive skin but this stuff is so gentle and pleasant. I&#x27;m buying another jar right now!</li>
    <li> I am delighted with this mask.  It does a great job cleansing and exfoliating my skin, and the price is reasonable as well.  Thank you for good service and an effective mask that is 100% organic.  I love it!</li>
    <li> This is just what I was looking for in a mask. It pulled so many impurities out of my pores. My skin felt refreshed and clean after!</li>
    <li> Used once so far, and I have already received compliments that my skin looked brighter, more refreshed. I had a small breakout on my jaw line and I could feel this working. Totally in love with this product :-)</li>
    <li> This mask makes my skin look great after using it and It smells like lavender. When i first opened it some of the water had separated from the water. I closed it, shook it up a bit, and it was fine after that. The only problem with it is that it dries quickly when applying, so it can be hard to spread evenly. Other than that it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and after only 8 min my skin was on &amp;#34;fire&amp;#34;. I had to use very cold water to calm it down. Will not buy again and i would like my money back preferably. I knew buying mud was a crazy idea, but I thought I might be the crazy one for not to give it a try with all the glowing reviews. Never again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. All natural. A little goes a long way. Leaves my skin feeling really clean and soft.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product! I have the most sensitive skin and the Mud Mask treats it like a goddess! It is so beautifully fragrant and rich, you can feel and see the difference after you have it on.</li>
    <li> I am finding the mask very refreshing.  Skin is soft after using.</li>
    <li> loved it! I could see results right away!</li>
    <li> It smelled great and it left my skin smelling good, very easy to use. A little expensive but based on the materials you can see why it cost so much.</li>
    <li> This was a lovely, effective face mask and will last for many more treatments.</li>
    <li> I have used a couple masks before that I didn&#x27;t really care for but THIS ONE I LOVE! The texture is great, and the smell is amazing. Such a relaxing aroma, doesn&#x27;t tighten the skin too much to the point that it&#x27;s uncomfortable either. Left it on for like 12 minutes and then rinsed off. My skin that was peeling prior to the mask was now completely smooth and cleared up! A little lasted a long way but when I run out I will definitely re-order! :)</li>
    <li> LOVE this product! It&#x27;s wonderful and works so well and it&#x27;s all natural which I LOVE!</li>
    <li> Works well! Thick and creamy...lays on smooth...smells good</li>
    <li> I really like this mud mask! The dead sea mud mixed with the organic and natural ingredients make this heavy mask smell and work great. I love the smell, it&#x27;s aromatic but not in a way that would trigger my allergies or skin sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;When I washed it off, my skin liked so good, it looked like I had makeup (foundation) on.&lt;br /&gt;I asked my husband if my skin looked any different and he stared, then said &amp;#34;oh wow, your skin looks great, like really even toned as if you have on makeup&amp;#34;!&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;m a little lacking in washing off makeup EVERY night, this is especially good for me to get a deep clean!</li>
    <li> I tried this on my face and body, it helped my face /skin feeling soft and got rid of all that dead dry skin! It really gets in your pores and pulls out all the muck in your skin! It&#x27;s truly a luscious product!</li>
    <li> Great product, with absolutely no skin irritation. Customer Service Rep followed up with me after my purchase to see how I liked the product. I would definitely order this mask again in the future, &amp; highly recommend the seller.</li>
    <li> Immediately after using the mask, my face felt smoother and tighter.  I highly recommend this product.  Only con would be that the smell which isn&#x27;t too bad once it begins to dry.  The smell is like an earthy dirt smell which makes sense.  Again, well worth it.</li>
    <li> I really love this mask. It goes on so nice and is so easy to take off. It leaves my skin so soft. I highly recommend this product. It is one of the best masks I have used. I have used many. Give it a try, I am sure you will love it too. B</li>
    <li> mask leaves skin feeling clean and hydrated. will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is the best mask I have found so far. It pulls any impurities out of the skin but is so gentle that it can be used every day. It&#x27;s full of organic oils so it doesn&#x27;t dry the skin out but does have a nice lifting effect and leaves a glow. Scented with organic lavender, it smells wonderful. Highly recommend and will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many masks before...this one takes the cake.  I love how it feels going on, and also how refreshed my skin feels afterwards!  The smell is amazing - smells mostly like lavender to me.  Love the ingredients, too!  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works great. Love the smell. The salt makes my skin so nice and clean. Thank you.</li>
    <li> My hubby tends to have red acne spots on his face still. This mud mask helped to reduce them and give his face a soft lovely feel!</li>
    <li> Aspen Kay is one of my new favorite products! I first fell in love with their bar soap and decided to give their mask a try. I&#x27;ve only used it twice, but already I am noticing a difference. My skin is softer and brighter, and most importantly, CLEARER! And it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like other harsh masks can.</li>
    <li> My friend recommended this mask because my skin sucks ass. I was skeptical but I gave it a try. Literally cured my dry and itchy skin after 2 uses. Since puberty my face has been dry and constantly itchy, always flaky and no exfoliators ever helped. I used this mask twice and noticed an improvement after the second time using it, I now use it every day and my face is as soft as a babies! I highly recommend. I also use it all over my body because I have a skin condition similar to psoriasis and this mask has helped a lot. I would also recommend the soap. They both smell amazing and leave my skin looking and feeling beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing stuff!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Z</li>
    <li> This is a terrific mask. I have problematic skin and have used this a couple of times and it has already made a difference. I am aways looking for the perfect mask and I have finally found it. Added bonus is that it smells delightful!!</li>
    <li> You gotta get this! The littlest bit goes the longest way, so this jar could pretty much last you... well... it&#x27;ll LAST.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally, when I&#x27;ve used any kind of mask (or even face wash for that matter), my skin will dry out immediately. But when using this, I almost didn&#x27;t even bother to use any face moisturizer afterwards as my skin felt nice and soft from the mask alone.</li>
    <li> Thank you! This is the best mask I ever use it. Will Highly recommend to every-one.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife, so she is the one reviewing this: &amp;#34;Most mud masks I have tried in the past smell like, well, MUD! This mud mask smells heavenly! I love the smell of lavender. My skin was soft after using this mask - some masks leave my skin feeling dried out. I noticed my skin was cleaner looking, fewer blackheads and there was a nice clean glow to my skin. Definitely recommend this product!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> By far the best facial mask I have ever used! My face has never been so soft or clear!  I highly recommend this mask for those who just want to brighten up their complexions or deep clean their pores!!  Bonus: it smelled amazing.... very relaxing!!!!  Love love love!!!</li>
    <li> Great product- love the smell and feel of this mask. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This mask is great! I got it earlier than expected. It is a dark color mask with a strong smell of lavender. After putting a thin layer on my face, I started to feel it harden after just  few minutes. I usually leave it on for about 15 minutes. Once you wash it off, it leaves the face very very soft. It is great!!! I have a combination skin and have had no problems so far.</li>
    <li> Very nice and great customer service they care whether you are happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Very nice mask, my face felt very clean and soft after...BUT use a disposable cloth to wash off--my microfiber cloth was black after one wash off...wouldn&#x27;t rinse out.</li>
    <li> I have combination dry and oily skin.  Dry on my chin to the point of red &amp; flakey.  My usual combination of Aztec clay + apple cider vinegar was proving too drying for my skin so i tried the dead sea mask.  This mask is wonderfully moistruizing!  It makes my skin feel so silky and clean.  I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
    <li> I have tried many dead sea mudd masks before but this one is by far the best. Your face will have such beautiful clarity when you wash it off. I would recommend pairing the mask with Argon oil.</li>
