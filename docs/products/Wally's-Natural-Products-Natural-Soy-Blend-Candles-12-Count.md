      <li>IT&#x27;S AMAZING</li>

      <li>these work amazingly.</li>
      <li>You get what you pay for and these are extremely high quality and work perfectly.</li>
      <li>They work great, and it is wonderful to be able to order enough to have them on hand.</li>

      <li>Sure these say not to use on your ears, but hey, so do Q tips.  </li>
      <li>Not quite sure why the picture says this is drops</li>
      <li>Thanks for the great service</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering more...</li>
      <li>safety, make sure you stick the burning end of the candle in water and cut it off and then relight it and continue pulling wax out of your ear.&lt;br</li>
      <li>love it, always amazed at the wax that comes out, very safe, will order more soon running low, great buy</li>
      <li>I have not been able to find these available locally at a better price.</li>
      <li>#34;The success of Wally&#x27;s is in the creativity of our customers and the many ways they use and enjoy our candles,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Light it and unwind as the downward smoke therapy cascades warm air in the selected area,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;For Entertainment Use</li>
      <li>or so I happily used ear candles to clear out some of the gunk in my ears.&lt;br</li>
      <li>But I am satisfied knowing that I have clean ears now.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t clog as easily as the others.</li>
      <li>They are easy to use and I would recommend them to anyone</li>
      <li>Easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Being something of a skeptic, however, I burned two of these candles without sticking them in my ears first to make sure they burned cleanly, i.e. no buildup of any kind inside the candle.  </li>
      <li>The wax kind of smells funny while burning the candle.</li>
      <li>Maybe its my fault for not reading the fine print.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use, pain free.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much for the great service.</li>
      <li>Cheap quality &amp; image is NOT what you are given</li>
      <li>Great product and I couldn&#x27;t believe that I received this the next day!  </li>
      <li>but they are soy dipped muslin candles which you light to candle your ears.  </li>
      <li>listening to the crackling sound, it is not an</li>
      <li>it is fantastic to have on hand....</li>
      <li>Wally&#x27;s is the only Candle for this use; it is perfect for removing ear wax, very soothing and well made.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used these in the past and they are the best non-invasive way to manage your ear</li>
      <li>We thought our ears where clean until we tried this.</li>
      <li>He has clean ears now.  </li>
      <li>and they don&#x27;t wipe clean either...</li>
      <li>It did not; there wasa good deal of gritty residue in the bottom of the candle.  </li>
      <li>this works the same and just as good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to know the old time remedies are still around</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different brands and Wally&#x27;s are the best.</li>
      <li>I have read many reviews saying that these dont really pull the wax out, but it definitely circulates warm air in your ear</li>
      <li>They work great, but seem to take a little longer to pull.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t have as much suction as hoped, there seems to be a bulky wax buildup at the tip preventing anything from really being able to come up into the cone.</li>
      <li>We had fun with it</li>
      <li>but if you want deep clean go the more spendy route</li>
      <li>Anyone who doesn&#x27;t  think this works, is not doing it right.</li>
      <li>Seems to pull the wax right out.  </li>
      <li>I am very satisfied with the purchase, I think is a little over price, other than that they are great</li>
      <li>They burned very well and the smell it is not bad at all.</li>
      <li>I hit the “Purchase” button too fast before doing my research and my husband ended up going to the Minute Clinic and ENT to get his ear wax completely and safely out.</li>
      <li>I do not know what more I could possibly say.</li>
      <li>The slowest burning candles, draw the most inner ear debris.  </li>
      <li>Most people are visual buyers.</li>
      <li>First time using candles.  </li>
      <li>In my experience they burn almost twice as long as most candles do.</li>
      <li>I bought these and pretty much had an impromptu ear candling party at my house.  </li>
      <li>You will be amazed at how much wax  comes out of your ears after using these for the first time..</li>
      <li>least amazon customer service was extremely nice, and refunded me the full amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a large burning fire stick placed on your head.</li>
      <li>and they certainly work, considering the grossness that was inside at the end.  </li>
      <li>they work really well and do not clog.</li>
      <li>I can ear again, thanks</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was buying ear wax candles locally and then I found these online.  The best thing that I had done was place my order here! Thanks for the great service and I will be glad to work with these sellers again!!</li>
    <li> We don&#x27;t condone using ear candles and I can tell you from experience, yes, they do work!!! These are not a novelty item and a party trick.  If used correctly they will suction wax plugs from the ear canal.  I have used these for over 12 years and can tell you, a sufferer of constant allergies and sufferer of constant wax build up these work!!!!</li>
    <li> I had a blockage of wax in my ear and I was in dire need of relief. Used these, and I could hear again! I have read many reviews saying that these dont really pull the wax out, but it definitely circulates warm air in your ear that apparently was all I needed to loosen the wax and hear again!</li>
    <li> They work great, but seem to take a little longer to pull.  I don&#x27;t understand why they have a plastic straw like item inside the candle.</li>
    <li> I recently had an ear infection and while talking to my hair stylist she told me about ear candling at the spa she worked at. I paid $30 for both of my ears to be candled at the spa. What came out of my ears was GROSS!!! And I clean my ears everyday. My ear infection felt better almost immediately with it going away completely the next day.  I saw the package of the product they use it said Wally&#x27;s. I came home and ordered some for my husband and I to use so I don&#x27;t have to pay the $30 again. I have used them once a month for the past two months and no ear infections and a noticeable difference in sinus pressure in my ears. (I have severe allergies). My husband is a pilot and subject to very loud jet engines the candles have cleaned the build up of ear wax in his ears. We thought our ears where clean until we tried this. Now I will be candling my ears every 4-6 weeks from now on. I am very happy with Wally&#x27;s Candles!</li>
    <li> Great product and I couldn&#x27;t believe that I received this the next day!  I read where someone posted that there were no instructions, however, there actually are instructions on the inside of the box. You have to cut the box and there they are.  Thanks so much for the great service.</li>
    <li> After using paraffin candles, I find these do not draw wax from ears well at all.  The hole is too small.</li>
    <li> These didn&#x27;t do the trick. Maybe its my fault for not reading the fine print.  When these burn... they let off small ash particles that float ALL OVER.  I did it in my bathroom and now i have black flecks all over...and they don&#x27;t wipe clean either... they smudge.</li>
    <li> love it, always amazed at the wax that comes out, very safe, will order more soon running low, great buy</li>
    <li> We used to buy these all of the time, but these are not as sturdy and lost there shape and were pretty much useless to us.</li>
    <li> Sure these say not to use on your ears, but hey, so do Q tips.  Light the end of a candle with the other end in your ear and you&#x27;ll pull wax out.  It&#x27;s genius.  No more jabbing the wax down deeper with Q tips.  When I was buying these, I noticed some of the reviewers said that they held to their ear and then held to their finger and got the same amount of wax out.  These people didn&#x27;t know what they were looking for.  The wax from your ear will come out in small 1/4&amp;#34; long skinny clumps.  Remember people, your ear is small so don&#x27;t expect to get a ton of wax out.  The wax from the candle is more powdery and is lighter in color, as long as you have the candle lit, you will see the candle wax no matter what you&#x27;re holding the other end too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For safety, make sure you stick the burning end of the candle in water and cut it off and then relight it and continue pulling wax out of your ear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what else you&#x27;d use these for but the package says they are for aromatherapy or something.  I just use them for removing ear wax.</li>
    <li> These candles pulled so much wax out of my ears it was ridiculous. Would recommend to everyone. Easy to use, pain free. I&#x27;ve heard people claim to hear better... I don&#x27;t. But I am satisfied knowing that I have clean ears now.</li>
    <li> This is a fun thing to do on a lazy afternoon.  My grandson got a kick out of having it done this summer.</li>
    <li> they work really well and do not clog. I only wish they were cheaper. They have a reinforced tip that prevents clogging</li>
    <li> Outright fraud. Ear candles do nothing, which has been shown countless times. If you use these, you&#x27;re an idiot. If you use these on your children, you&#x27;re abusive. If you make these, you deserve to go bankrupt.</li>
    <li> He has clean ears now.  It was nasty seeing what came out but he was pleased.  The wax kind of smells funny while burning the candle.</li>
    <li> This DOES not work for anything involving ear wax!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE DON NOT BE FOOLED!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it a few times and was amazed how much wax came out!&lt;br /&gt;Then.....  my father tried this out but was holding the tip not in his ear, but against the tip of his finger.&lt;br /&gt;well guess what?!?!  His FINGER had the same amount of \\&quot;wax\\&quot; as his ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please do NOT fall for this.  My father still laughs at how naive I was.&lt;br /&gt;There is NO way that there is that much ear wax in anyones ears (or finger tips, lol)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least amazon customer service was extremely nice, and refunded me the full amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still ashamed to have fallen for this scam.</li>
    <li> I bought these and pretty much had an impromptu ear candling party at my house.  We had fun with it and they certainly work, considering the grossness that was inside at the end.  I could hear better afterwards, too.  From now on, though, I will poke a hole in the center of a paper plate and stick the candle through it to prevent ashing/burning clothes.  Do you know spas charge $50 for this service?  Also, if you use Q-tips you should really use this product every six months or so.</li>
    <li> Watch Youtube videos on this..it is a sucker purchase. I am hoping they have another use besides putting in the ear so I can get my money’s worth, because after seeing the wax that develops inside the hollow candle is actually from the candle  itself and does not have the “suction” effect is says it does, and can puts your ear drum at risk, I would never use this..I hit the “Purchase” button too fast before doing my research and my husband ended up going to the Minute Clinic and ENT to get his ear wax completely and safely out. I would recommend if you have wax issues to do the same.  His ears were completely full of hardened wax and only a professional should do stuff like that.</li>
    <li> Have had ear wax issues in the past&lt;br /&gt;This has been the best solution (much better then the clinic)&lt;br /&gt;Just need to work on that selective hearing</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these in the past and they are the best non-invasive way to manage your ear health.&lt;br /&gt;Only 1 minor caution (not hard to do) is being careful as the candle burns down.  Follow directions&lt;br /&gt;and take precautions and you will have no issues.</li>
    <li> My sister and I both candled our ears and it felt great. They are easy to use and I would recommend them to anyone</li>
    <li> We are very happy with the product. The service was great. Our mom is 96 and when mom is happy so are we!! Thank you, Your company  will do great if you continue  to care God bless, Mary D</li>
    <li> I only think to purchase these once every 5-6 years and am always amazed at what we can *pull* from our kids&#x27; ears when we use them as ear candles.  The term gross would probably be a gross understatement!  We are always extremely happy with our Wally&#x27;s candles.</li>
    <li> I recommend using these at least once a week or every other week. Very good price for 12 candles.You will be amazed at how much wax  comes out of your ears after using these for the first time..</li>
    <li> Waste of money - did not work as advertised.  I do not recommend.  Typically I am very happy with Amazon purchases, but not thsi time</li>
    <li> After I purchased these i read how to use them. It&#x27;s easy, it&#x27;s also bad for you as it can make the ear wax worse, it really doesn&#x27;t help at all ever, and it&#x27;s a large burning fire stick placed on your head. This has caused fires in homes. These are just mystical belief and really will not help loosen or remove ear wax. Do the research and save your money.</li>
    <li> These work great, but are made cheaply but that is what you get for the price you pay.  They work well enough but if you want deep clean go the more spendy route</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m afraid I bought these on the suggestion of a friend without first researching it. Unfortunately it is quackery, the &#x27;wax&#x27; residue that is supposedly pulled from your ear is actually just paraffin wax collected from the smoke that is going into your ear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just use q-tips and pull/scrape the wax out instead of pushing it in.</li>
    <li> OMG I LOVED IT! THE RINGING IN M EARS (FOR 3 YEARS) HAS STOPPED! IT&#x27;S AMAZING THE CRUD THAT COMES OUT.</li>
    <li> Even though the description said 12 candles ...the picture is all I saw, making me think I was purchasing more for my money. If they picture in the ad the box which was mailed, that would be great and not mis-leading. Most people are visual buyers.</li>
    <li> we love these ear wax candles and both my husband and i feel like we can hear better after we finish using them.</li>
    <li> sixty years ago my grandfather did my ears the Italian way to get the wax out. this works the same and just as good. It&#x27;s nice to know the old time remedies are still around</li>
    <li> OMG.........I could not believe the amount of wax that came out of our ears. 4 of us used these and everyone of us had lots of built up wax. Anyone who doesn&#x27;t  think this works, is not doing it right. The hole is  not too small. Directions on the inside of the box were very helpful. My sister and I will both be using these from now on.  Thank You</li>
    <li> The slowest burning candles, draw the most inner ear debris.  I&#x27;ve tried every brand under the sun, and nothing comes close to Wally&#x27;s in quality and price.  In my experience they burn almost twice as long as most candles do.</li>
    <li> It a product favolys for my family. I ear so good before used this produc give me. Another oportunity in the life I can ear again, thanks</li>
    <li> GREAT QUALITY! They burned very well and the smell it is not bad at all. I am very satisfied with the purchase, I think is a little over price, other than that they are great</li>
    <li> Wally&#x27;s is the only Candle for this use; it is perfect for removing ear wax, very soothing and well made.  Perfect!</li>
    <li> Good ear candle for removing the wax. Needs some tune ups, like opening the ends. I would recommend this brand.</li>
    <li> I have not been able to find these available locally at a better price. They work great, and it is wonderful to be able to order enough to have them on hand.</li>
    <li> bought these for build up of ear wax and they work great.  I would recommend them.  Just make sure you follow directions.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different brands and Wally&#x27;s are the best. I&#x27;ve given &amp;#34;samples&amp;#34; to friends and family and we all have the same opinion. I&#x27;ll be ordering more...</li>
    <li> The last time I did ear candling was about 5 years ago.  After purchasing Wally&#x27;s soy blend candles, I intend to not wait as long as the last time and do this on a monthly basis!  These candles worked amazingly well, burned slowly and were extremely well made.  I debated spending less money on other candles and am so glad I got these.  You get what you pay for and these are extremely high quality and work perfectly.</li>
    <li> I had tried several types of ear candles for my son who has recurrent ear troubles. I love this one because it has a small plastic fitting in the end that prevents the residue from the candle from falling down into his ear</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t have as much suction as hoped, there seems to be a bulky wax buildup at the tip preventing anything from really being able to come up into the cone.</li>
    <li> These work very well. Easy to use and does not have bad smell. I couldn&#x27;t believe how much stuff it pulled out of my ears.</li>
    <li> These are made exceptionally well and I was surprised at how slowly they burn.  I think I found my favorite!  Also, for years my family &amp; I have used &amp;#34;Wally&#x27;s Ear Oil&amp;#34;....it is fantastic to have on hand....great for ear pain, itchy ear, swimmer&#x27;s ear, great for your dog or cat&#x27;s ear too...keep in mind that it&#x27;s a natural product so invest in a new bottle once it expires.</li>
    <li> Burned one in a empty cup on the same angle you would in your ear. At the end we opened it up and to my surprise it was full of the same earwax I had found in other similar candles.&lt;br /&gt;Turns out it is not ear wax (obviously) but the wax used to coat the candle.</li>
    <li> Not quite sure why the picture says this is drops but they are soy dipped muslin candles which you light to candle your ears.  They work so good,  I just ordered another box.  Such an excellent way to remove wax from ears and no pain.</li>
    <li> First time using candles.  Seems to pull the wax right out.  Easy to use.  Will buy again for sure.  j</li>
    <li> Anyone who says these work should eat some quartz crystals and tell me how they fix a headache. These don&#x27;t work at all. My ears were just the same after 2 candles each. I burnt one candle without putting it in my ear and there was just as much so-called ear wax in the candle as the ones I used while they were in my year. Boy can these bull***t artists con you out of your money.</li>
    <li> These are very slow burning candles, I can use one for both ears.  I especially liked the plastic tip inserted into the cone that minimized blockage, in fact  I don&#x27;t recall that candle got blocked up at all.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> These were pricey &amp; sucked! They weren&#x27;t even open at the bottom! Cheap quality &amp; image is NOT what you are given</li>
    <li> VERY flimsy. Was very disappointed.  I don&#x27;t know if it was the blend or if it was poorly made, will not buy again.</li>
    <li> The best ear candles I have found. They work better because of the built in plastic tips. Don&#x27;t clog as easily as the others.</li>
    <li> Good price.  All worked as expected.  I will buy them again. I do not know what more I could possibly say.</li>
    <li> these work amazingly. i have tried others before and none of them work as good as these. i would buy these again</li>
    <li> Great priduct, great quality. I wish it came with instructions tho. I youtubed it and found a method that way.</li>
    <li> this product kept going out when I lite it! I had to keep it on fire the whole time to use it and that was a bit scary.</li>
    <li> First off, I will preface this product review with quotes directly from the product packaging.  The brand name of this product is &amp;#34;Wally&#x27;s Ear Company.&amp;#34;  The product is the &amp;#34;Natural Soy Blend Candle.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quotes right off the box: &amp;#34;Multi-Purpose Hollow Candle,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;The success of Wally&#x27;s is in the creativity of our customers and the many ways they use and enjoy our candles,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Light it and unwind as the downward smoke therapy cascades warm air in the selected area,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;For Entertainment Use Only.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was a kid I had ear infections all the time and horrible problems with wax buildup.  Every once in a while my mom would break out the ear candles, and they seemed to help.  As an adult, I decided to try the same thing, and bought some cheap ear candles in bulk (not the same brand I am reviewing here).  Being something of a skeptic, however, I burned two of these candles without sticking them in my ears first to make sure they burned cleanly, i.e. no buildup of any kind inside the candle.  They did, and every six months or so I happily used ear candles to clear out some of the gunk in my ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I ran out of ear candles and decided to try Wally&#x27;s.  My natural skepticism kicked in right away when I saw the candles being touted as &amp;#34;all natural soy blend&amp;#34; since in my book function and not aroma is the primary goal of using such products.  But I bought the 12-pack and decided to give it a try anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These candles are a little different from ones that I have successfully used in the past; they feature an &amp;#34;integrated filter&amp;#34; according to the box.  This is interesting because an ear candle should be extracting from the ear via vacuum effect instead of putting anything into the ear, so why is a filter even necessary?  In order to satisfy myself about the safety of the product, I burned one down to a three-inch stub and checked to see if it burned clean.  It did not; there wasa good deal of gritty residue in the bottom of the candle.  I will not be burning one of these in my ear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, this particular brand of ear candle is non-functional as an ear candle.  If you want to buy them for aroma therapy, they may satisfy you.  I will probably end up giving them away to someone else who wants to use them for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also point out that there is no &amp;#34;downward smoke&amp;#34; effect either, in case your interest in this product had something to do with that feature.</li>
    <li> Pulled out an infection from my body. Good price at $2/candle. Please do research on how to use ear candles.</li>
    <li> If you are on the fence about using ear candles, I HIGHLY recommend these. I work at a store with a drivetrough, and after wearing at headset for 40 hours a week, my ears start to hurt. The ear candles always relieve the pain and bring back some hearing. The difference is noticeable. highly, highly, highly recommended</li>
    <li> Will definitely be purchasing again!  I have always had trouble with wax in my right ear.  This is the only way that works for me!</li>
    <li> When I received the items I was a bit wary of how effective they could be due to he design. My friend and I tried with similar results. But then I lit one and just let it burn without putting into an ear and SAME RESULTS. Total sham this product was and I encourage ppl not to waste their money.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;Although the process of ear candles is soothing&lt;br /&gt;i.e., listening to the crackling sound, it is not an&lt;br /&gt;item that solved my ear problem and after researching&lt;br /&gt;it further, the item is just a novelty for entertainment&lt;br /&gt;and not real. The wax that you find at the end of&lt;br /&gt;the process is not from your ear it is from the&lt;br /&gt;candle itself. There is no real vacuum action that&lt;br /&gt;removes your earwax. So a waste of money.</li>
