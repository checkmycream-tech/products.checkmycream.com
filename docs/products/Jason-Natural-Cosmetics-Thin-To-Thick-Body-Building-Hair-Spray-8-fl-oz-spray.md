<ol>
      <li>Great styling and holding hair spray!</li>
      <li>It controls my hair perfectly and smells wonderful.  </li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>I was looking for hairspray that didn&#x27;t have a chemical smell to it and this product is great.  </li>
      <li>But it is a great  product.  </li>
      <li>Their Products are just great</li>
      <li>This is a great product, I have the shampoo, conditioner, and the hairspray, this stuff works wonders.</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful product, one I&#x27;ve used for many years.  </li>
      <li>Glad I found it!</li>
      <li>This product is 100% better than nioxin!  </li>
      <li>Clean smelling and does a great job holding the hair in place.  </li>
      <li>Nice product, calming scent, and seems to give hair a healthy appearance.</li>
      <li>i think that makes more sense.</li>
      <li>it works more like a conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll have to continue my quest for safe hair spray.</li>
      <li>I love all the jason products I use.</li>
      <li>I wanted to love this hairspray.</li>
      <li>Women compliment and say it looks full and nice.</li>
      <li>my reasons: #1--the fragrance is waaaay to strong and it lingers all day;</li>
      <li>Like the product just not as strong a hold as I am accustomed to.</li>
      <li>makes your hair smooth.  </li>
      <li>For a non aerosol hairspray that doesn&#x27;t leave your hair stiff this is great!!!</li>
      <li>love this product and cheaper than buying it at Whole Foods.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to find a natural hair spray product that performs this well.</li>
      <li>Amazon sellers are generally more reasonable than area stores were, even including shipping.  </li>
      <li>my hair is styled, I again lightly spray, which does a great job of keeping it in place without making my hair stiff.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair stay in really good for a long time.</li>
      <li>Most important for me, it is perhaps the only hairspray in decades to which I have no allergy.  </li>
      <li>It leaves a natural look without the stiffness of many hair sprays.</li>
      <li>I add liquid vitamin D-3, really seems to do well for my thinning hair!  </li>
      <li>It also makes my hair pretty stringy and a bit frizzy.</li>
      <li>I have found that the best way to use this is to apply a small amount to damp hair before you blow dry.</li>
      <li>I really really wanted to like this product...</li>
      <li>I still use my Aubrey hairspray because the Jason&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t give much hold.</li>
      <li>I really like this hairspray.</li>
      <li>I really like the &amp;#34;leave in, quality of this hair care product.</li>
      <li>this doesn&#x27;t really add body.  </li>
      <li>Beautician put in too much chemical relaxer.</li>
      <li>I think the spray is a good one, but if one tries to stay away from environmental chemicals such as fragrances, this is NOT for you.  </li>
      <li>This really works to give body to my fine flat hair!</li>
      <li>Thin, sparse hair has more body when using Jason&#x27;s - Love it and highly recommend it to others.  </li>
      <li>It holds nicely, combs out well, and hair feels clean until the next usual shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Doesnt have the hold I am used to - which is more or less lacquer, so maybe it is an adjustment thing.  </li>
      <li>but I do like the idea of all natural and love their other products.</li>
      <li>Then use your normal hairspray for hold and lift.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t normally take the time to review products I buy here</li>
      <li>It is very strange that they didn&#x27;t go with a more natural essential oil based fragrance (like the Aubrey hairspray).</li>
      <li>It makes my hair soft.</li>
      <li>I also like the fact that both the shampoo and hair spray are natural.</li>
      <li>I curl my hair and within an hour, it is completely flat and straight.</li>
      <li>In short, I plan on being a steady customer, and would recommend the shampoo and spray to anyone.</li>
      <li>I have to be careful not to use too much</li>
      <li>Now look forward to it growing back in with natural hair style.</li>
      <li>I cut what was left and wear it natural.</li>
      <li>It is thin hair friendly!</li>
      <li>it does not dry out my scalp her hair.</li>
      <li>Perhaps my success is using it in small bursts, rather than sustained sprays.  </li>

<li> The biggest complaint is the smell!!</li>
<li> Unfortunately, it does not hold my hair in place at all.</li>
<li> This stuff smells awful, as do the conditioner and shampoo that go with the line.  </li>

    <li> I add liquid vitamin D-3, really seems to do well for my thinning hair!  I really like the &amp;#34;leave in, quality of this hair care product.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product, one I&#x27;ve used for many years.  I don&#x27;t find it gooey, as a previous reviewer said.  Perhaps my success is using it in small bursts, rather than sustained sprays.  It holds nicely, combs out well, and hair feels clean until the next usual shampoo.  I used to buy this product locally, but now it&#x27;s almost impossible to find.  Amazon sellers are generally more reasonable than area stores were, even including shipping.  Most important for me, it is perhaps the only hairspray in decades to which I have no allergy.  If you are looking to turn baby-fine hair into total thickness, this is not going to do it.  But it is a great  product.  Thank you, Amazon sellers, for keeping me supplied!</li>
    <li> I have used Jason Natural Thin To Thick Hair Spray for years. It leaves a natural look without the stiffness of many hair sprays.</li>
    <li> Works well. Does not weigh hair down. I would recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> We like it, not a real strong hold though.</li>
    <li> Like the product just not as strong a hold as I am accustomed to.</li>
    <li> I use the shampoo, so thought I&#x27;d try the spray. I work just a little of the spray through my hair before blow drying. It adds a lot of body, making my naturally thin, baby-fine hair appear to have twice the volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once my hair is styled, I again lightly spray, which does a great job of keeping it in place without making my hair stiff. Please note the word LIGHTLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice less breakage, and less hair loss to boot. I also like the fact that both the shampoo and hair spray are natural. In short, I plan on being a steady customer, and would recommend the shampoo and spray to anyone.</li>
    <li> For a non aerosol hairspray that doesn&#x27;t leave your hair stiff this is great!!!</li>
    <li> This really works to give body to my fine flat hair! I have to be careful not to use too much or I will have to wash it out the next day. I still use my Aubrey hairspray because the Jason&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t give much hold. The biggest complaint is the smell!! It smells like chemical laden laundry detergent. It is very strange that they didn&#x27;t go with a more natural essential oil based fragrance (like the Aubrey hairspray). I have found that the best way to use this is to apply a small amount to damp hair before you blow dry. Then use your normal hairspray for hold and lift.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this hairspray. Unfortunately, it does not hold my hair in place at all. I curl my hair and within an hour, it is completely flat and straight. It also makes my hair pretty stringy and a bit frizzy. I&#x27;ll have to continue my quest for safe hair spray.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only one I use. The hair spray around.</li>
    <li> this doesn&#x27;t really add body.  it works more like a conditioner.  makes your hair smooth.  it sprays on very wet.  it&#x27;s not sticky though.  they should market it as a leave in conditioner.  i think that makes more sense.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, I have the shampoo, conditioner, and the hairspray, this stuff works wonders. I recommend this to anyone with thinning hair or just getting here five stars all the way.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells awful, as do the conditioner and shampoo that go with the line.  I think the spray is a good one, but if one tries to stay away from environmental chemicals such as fragrances, this is NOT for you.  And it is NOT for me.</li>
    <li> love this product and cheaper than buying it at Whole Foods.</li>
    <li> It controls my hair perfectly and smells wonderful.  Other hair sprays make my head itch because I am allergic to their fragrances.</li>
    <li> Great styling and holding hair spray!</li>
    <li> Thin, sparse hair has more body when using Jason&#x27;s - Love it and highly recommend it to others.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Doesnt have the hold I am used to - which is more or less lacquer, so maybe it is an adjustment thing.  Perhaps two spritzings will do the trick but I do like the idea of all natural and love their other products.</li>
    <li> Nice product, calming scent, and seems to give hair a healthy appearance.</li>
    <li> I really really wanted to like this product...I&#x27;ve been looking for an alternative to the toxic hairsprays that are out there...BUT I did not like it and won&#x27;t be using it. Here&#x27;re my reasons: #1--the fragrance is waaaay to strong and it lingers all day; #2--it didn&#x27;t hold my thin hair well…not at all really; and #3--it actually made my hair look greasy. I don&#x27;t normally take the time to review products I buy here but my intention for doing it now is to save someone from wasting their money on this product as I did.</li>
    <li> Cut my hair after surgery due to possible damage from anesthesia. Beautician put in too much chemical relaxer. My new hair growth washed down the drain and left severe damage. I cut what was left and wear it natural. Jason shampoo and especially hair spray have enhanced my thinning hair. Women compliment and say it looks full and nice.Now look forward to it growing back in with natural hair style. Smell is not different from others at salon. Don&#x27;t like stiff hair. Also purchase from Amazon for price and convenience.</li>
    <li> This product is 100% better than nioxin!  It is thin hair friendly! No stickiness. Doesnt weigh the hair down. No helmet hair. Keeps every hair in place without looking plastic</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to find a natural hair spray product that performs this well.</li>
    <li> I love all the jason products I use. I just bought the apricot shampoo and cream rinse . It makes my hair soft.</li>
    <li> I was looking for hairspray that didn&#x27;t have a chemical smell to it and this product is great.  Clean smelling and does a great job holding the hair in place.  Glad I found it!</li>
    <li> Their Products are just great I use them all the time even though there is some alcohol in their spray it does not dry out my scalp her hair.</li>
    <li> I used this product a couple of times and because it wasn&#x27;t an aerosol the spray was too heavy and made my hair wet.</li>
    <li> I really like this hairspray. It makes my hair stay in really good for a long time. Would reccomend it.</li>
