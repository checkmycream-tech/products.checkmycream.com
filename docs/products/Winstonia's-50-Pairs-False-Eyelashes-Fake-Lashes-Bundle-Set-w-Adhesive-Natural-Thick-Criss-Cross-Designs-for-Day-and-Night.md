      <li>so nice</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not a good value as it is a struggle to get them off the tray and applied without them coming apart, then when you remove them, more will pull off the end of the strip, making them a wear once and discard item.</li>
      <li>Biggest problem was the size, once they are shaped they are nice.</li>
      <li>The lashes are really nice..</li>

      <li>so I needed a bulk set of eyelashes for models or MUAs who don&#x27;t bring their own.  </li>
      <li>but I like using my own anyways.</li>
      <li>The quality is really good and they are so easy to use.  </li>
      <li>They will be the perfect curve and much easier to apply once you do this :-)</li>
      <li>what more can you ask for!??:-)</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s nice that this comes with so many.</li>

      <li>they&#x27;re easy to apply too!</li>

      <li>i loved the price of this item, and the quality are very good compare to what i would have expected if i bought it on ebay.  </li>
      <li>but the size isnt over the top.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It was alright alot of them for the priceee but they are plastic I have no idea if ill buy again i think not</li>
    <li> These are great. Came fast and i in great shape. The only thing wrong was the glue. It was dried out. I would suggest just to buy the glue from your local store.</li>
    <li> i loved the price of this item, and the quality are very good compare to what i would have expected if i bought it on ebay.  I tried one pair on today using glue, and it seems I can reuse the same pair multiple times!</li>
    <li> Bought these in my earlier days of using false eyelashes.  Gave them all away.</li>
    <li> I find this product to be great with fast shipping and it came with everything that it claims to come with. I will buy more in the future</li>
    <li> I love these! The only issue is the glue is less then great. Come on though... It&#x27;s 50 lashes! I&#x27;m just starting to wear lashes so its nice to have a bunch just in case I really mess up. Nothing was damaged and they all came in place. I will be buying these again when I need more. They are beautiful!!!</li>
    <li> Theres so many and you can mix and match the different styles. In face, I ordered this over a year ago and I&#x27;m still halfway through!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; appearance... Once on they look like fake lashes and that defeats the point.</li>
    <li> I love these... Even tho it&#x27;s my first time with wearing these they work fine and there really good quality for the price</li>
    <li> I hate this product, cause is so hard for put in the eyes, i need buy a lot at pharmacy.</li>
    <li> The lashes are really nice..but only one style could be worn as natural lashes. The other styles are very dramatic and not as natural looking as I thought. And it&#x27;s not as comfortable as I thought they would be.</li>
    <li> Cheap price,cheap lashes. Still sitting in my drawer. I recommend if you&#x27;re a noobie at makeup and want to play with lashes,go to your local beauty supply and buy those blue box lashes for $1. These bands are too thick even if youre going for a dramatic Halloween look,I just wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. Try nyx lashes!Or redcherry.</li>
    <li> A few of them have a very plastic like feel.  They don&#x27;t have a nice curve, they come off the clear plastic tray jacked up.  Maybe good for theatre or Halloween if you can get them to stay on.  NOT OK for brides or everyday wear.  You definitely need a good glue and will prob have to clip them to length as they are long. They also have a very wide and thick band.  They also fall off the plastic thing easily and you have no where to put them or keep them nice. You get what you pay for I guess.  Nothing like Ardell, red cherry, house of lashes, kiss, etc.</li>
    <li> What can you say about eyelashes? There is a nice selection, i ordered this and gave half to a friend, its a steal of a deal to get this many pairs for the price. I like to double up on falsies so it&#x27;s nice that this comes with so many.</li>
    <li> these are good lashes for a good price. you get 5 boxes of different lashes &amp; they&#x27;re all super cute. they&#x27;re easy to apply too! they shipped fast &amp; i&#x27;m definately impressed by that.</li>
    <li> 50 pairs of lashes?!  What could be better?  The quality is really good and they are so easy to use.  I am thrilled with this product.  The seller is extremely quick to ship and I actually received my lashes three days sooner than expected.  The value for your money is absolutely evident.  This is a deal you shouldn&#x27;t pass up.  Three different styles to suit your needs.  Don&#x27;t pass this one up folks.  The adhesive is pretty good although I did opt to use my old standby. I will be using this seller again and again.  Thanks for a great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> These lashes are great! I am a eyelash junkie so I was really happy when I was able to get 50 lashes for such a low price. I don&#x27;t why I didn&#x27;t think of buying these sooner. Fast shipping and awesome eyelashes what more can you ask for!??:-)</li>
    <li> I loved these eyelashes. They are not flimsy and they are easy to put on. I recommend these to anyone. There are 3 different looks to choose from, but they all look great.</li>
    <li> I am a makeup artist and I put lashes on each and every 1 of my customers I also wear them myself. These lashes were great look great and lasted 2 days H I will definitely reorder this item when I am out</li>
    <li> the great thing about this is the fact that there are sooo many lashes in the bundle. keep in mind that they lashes fit if you have big eyes like myself. my friend with small eyes tried to wear the lasshes and they were too large for her eye. Also, the lashes are EXTREMELY long... even the &amp;#34;thinner&amp;#34; ones, so none of them give you a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; look. Definitely good for a night out though.</li>
    <li> 50 pairs for 13 bucks is amazing. Im so excited to use them as soon as i buy some lash glue, which is NOT a big deal. Drug store lashes come with cheap glue as well. I thought the thick lashes would be to much for me but the size isnt over the top. Im going to buy some for my sister too.</li>
    <li> Hated all the lashes except the natural pair. Will not buy this triple lash duo ever again!&lt;br /&gt;But I will buy the natural one&#x27;s by it self</li>
    <li> I usually wear the ardell 105 or 117 .. these are the same .. they may be a little harder to work with as they do not bend that easy , but I used regular eyelash glue and they stayed in fine . The best thing about them is that one pair will last a long time ..when you take them off they do not change shape .. I linked this to all my friends ..</li>
    <li> I never use these because they&#x27;re way too dramatic looking and do not feel nice.</li>
    <li> I love this bundle.  The different sizes and thickness is awesome.  I have a small face and experimenting with the different thickness allowed me to find what works for me.</li>
    <li> still haven&#x27;t worn all the styles they give you !!</li>
    <li> These lashes were great although i only use about three styles out of the 5 they give, but it you&#x27;re looking for real hair lashes then these aren&#x27;t your the ones you want. Me on the other hand i don&#x27;t mind, because they look good enough.</li>
    <li> SO MANY EYELASHES!! Amazing price for this product, both for quantity and quality.</li>
    <li> These are all very long and the bands are thick, so they are definitely not natural looking.  Tricky to apply as well, due to the stiffness of the band.  Use extra glue at the corners so they don&#x27;t pop up on you.  Good price if you need them for theater or something costume-y.</li>
    <li> Some of these are perfect for everyday wear if you like more dramatic lashes, some though were just a bit over the top and I don&#x27;t think I will ever really get much use out of them. The plastic trays are pretty great for easy storage but the lashes don&#x27;t always like to stay stuck to them so you might lose a few. My biggest issue was with the band on some of these, they were very thick and a bit hard to manage. I still really love the ones I will wear and have worked out the bands on them to be more flexible, they last for about 10 applications if you clean them off each night, I just really disliked the thick stiff band though.</li>
    <li> I do not like eyelashes because yhey are to thick and hard to glue on.  will not order this brand again.</li>
    <li> I got these two days before it was estimated to get here!  I was so happy when I open them!  They were so pretty and and they were really easy to put on! 5/5</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for, really. They were better than I expected. I would definitely recommend buying eyelash glue seperately.</li>
    <li> Ok. That is how I would describe this product. At first I was in love with them and they are a good product for the price. However, I love Ardell lashes or Glam I Remy Human Hair Lashes. They are more natural looking. The glue inside this box is useless. I use Ardell Duo(dark) which is the best glue ever.</li>
    <li> its amazing.. i like the variety that have the eyelashes.. i like all styles.. and its easy to wear it... so nice</li>
    <li> I had gotten these and I was like &amp;#34;Wow, these are great!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;But then the glue that came with the lashes was no good to me.&lt;br /&gt;It was weird and chunky looking, was pretty hard to actually apply to the lashes.&lt;br /&gt;It seemed like enough to just put on one eyelash, ONE. The eyelashes themselves though were&lt;br /&gt;easy enough to put on, they don&#x27;t bend as much, but if you take your time... you&#x27;ll get it right.</li>
    <li> I feel that it&#x27;s a great buy!  You&#x27;re getting five different styles of lashes one for every mood.  So, I would definitely be recommending this product.</li>
    <li> These had everything from dramatic to natural! They worked great even though the band was a little stiff. The glue in the discription was a not included but I like using my own anyways.</li>
    <li> Love them! i was totally surprized how fast they shipped! the eyelashes them self are amazing! plus, super easy to use! the only thing id complain about, is the eyelash glue.&lt;br /&gt;it doesnt work and i find myself have to reapply the eyelashes when they fall off. dont get me wrong THE EYELASHES ARE GREAT but the glue sucks. so i just got different eyelash glue and BAM! i dont have to reapply and they stay on all day with no mishaps. i would buy them again! Oh! and if you apply the lash glue right and dont misuse the lashes they are totally reuseable!!! i love that they came with so many different styles also.&lt;br /&gt;  i hope my reveiw gave you girls the motivation to click on that BUY bar!&lt;br /&gt;  Good luck!</li>
    <li> last long and so much to choose from!</li>
    <li> These lashes feel rather hard therefore are hard to apply. They barely even stick to ur lid after u have applies glue</li>
    <li> These lashes were cheap and shipped fast. Even more, they&#x27;re amazing! I wear modest lashes almost every day because my eyelashes leave much to be desired, and the natural and longer natural sets are perfect for daily wear. I don&#x27;t like criss-cross lashes, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll survive for this price (and let&#x27;s be honest, I&#x27;ll probably still wear them if I&#x27;m in a pinch). I&#x27;ve tried on the fuller lashes, but haven&#x27;t worn them due to lack of occasion. They&#x27;re heavy, but if you cut them into sections, they&#x27;re probably easy to apply. I used Duo every time I applied these suckers, and they stayed on all day. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, these are a total bargain. I like to apply mascara before and after I put on lashes, and sometimes that destroys them after one or two uses, but I&#x27;ve worn 2 pairs of these since I got them and have had three uses out of each. I&#x27;ll most definitely be able to use them again. I feel like even if I only use the natural ones, it&#x27;s still a great buy, for less than 15 bucks when one set of comparable lashes is 4-8$ in a drug store. I&#x27;m happy, and I&#x27;ll definitely buy these again, no question!</li>
    <li> This lashes are completely unwearable, first of all the reviews explained it will give a natural look, well they are huge. I would wear then for halloween not for any other occasion. Also, I tried duo glue and they did not stay in place. It was a waste of money honestly.</li>
    <li> it was nice to get SO many pairs for such a good price, but the quality is sub-par. many of the lashes are mis-matched or uneven. definitely sacrificed quality for quantity on this one :(</li>
    <li> Best purchase ever!!! I swear i feel like i  won the lash lottery lol!!  i got a chance to try lashes i  normally never would of purchased</li>
    <li> Really like these lashes for what I pay for the set. I usually buy individual pairs at $4 a pop, so this made my day when I found them. Easy to put on with a bit of trimming (since my eyes a bit smaller than what the lashes naturally fit). I would recommend using your own glue, as opposed to what comes with the set. I use Duo which was just perfecto. Also, the strips become almost straight when you pull them off of the base, but with a little bit of shaping around my thumb it sort of curves as it should.</li>
    <li> These are absolutely wonderful and a great value.  I wear false eyelashes daily and these are every bit as good as if not better than a lot of the lashes I&#x27;ve purchased in stores.  I love the variety...will definitely buy again!!</li>
    <li> These eyelashes are great! I love the  styles, its  so practical for everyday beauty.  The variety and quantity is a luxury, especially since they&#x27;re reusable.</li>
    <li> I wish I could find some more natural lashes in a set like this. All in all they did pretty well with photoshoots and bridal clients. I gave a 4 for sturdiness, but maybe more like a 3.5 because they appear slightly plastic like.</li>
    <li> Great Value, just look really cheap.. especially the thick ones. The thin ones look nice, but the bottoms of them are still not as nice as others that i have purchased on amazon.</li>
    <li> These worked out very well I think they could of sent a little more eyelash glue with all of them, but that&#x27;s  the only complaint I have really.</li>
    <li> I really like the natural looking ones that came in set, that&#x27;s more my tastes. But all are very nice lashes.</li>
    <li> This bundle of lashes comes as it says. I&#x27;m a freelance makeup artist &amp; do events where I&#x27;m applying lashes in large volumes. Here is what I observed:&lt;br /&gt;They tend to be larger and will need to be trimmed (most lashes need to be trimmed to size anyway) and they are not the quality that you can get at Sally&#x27;s or Walgreens. They don&#x27;t cost as much either. You get what you pay for. Most of the lashes that I apply are used once and thrown away so, these work best for what I do.</li>
    <li> Bulk buying is a great way to save money and this is an awesome brand and product. I  will definitly buy again for our school!</li>
    <li> The lashes were very uncomfortable. The quality was horrible. Threw the rest away after one wear. Will not purchase this brand again.</li>
    <li> Plus side to buying these eyelashes in bulk was that they were cheaper. The eyelashes themselves are okay. Before I wear them I have to trim them to fit my eye. (Which might be inconvenient if you have small eyes) As mine are fairly big. Biggest problem was the size, once they are shaped they are nice.</li>
    <li> I love these lashes.. I was skeptical but after I tried a pair on I was sold. They look and feel so natural and I got so many compliments. They also shipped very very fast</li>
    <li> Was not happy with these, they have extra plastic pieces on both sides that you have to cut off. They are also very thick on the attachment area. Some of them broke when I was flexing them to let the glue set.</li>
    <li> These are great lashes for the price and quality. The shipment was quick.  I would definitely recommend this to friends and family.  Very pleased overall with everything.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m quite happy with this purchase! I usually buy high end things, but I decided to give this a go. And I&#x27;m quite happy with the quality. The band is actually quite flexible on all of them! With duo glue, they will last all day. Be prepared to trim the corners though, as they are quite long.</li>
    <li> You definitely want to buy different adhesive. The adhesive they provide is way too thin, and flakes a LOT. Other than that, the eyelashes are wonderful. Great quality, reusable, the glue line is barely visible after camouflaging it with eyeliner or eyeshadow and maybe some mascara. Very nice.</li>
    <li> I use fake eyelashes almost every day and this pack is a great way to save money! They are of high quality and stay on longer than any other lash set I have owned.  Will buy from again!</li>
    <li> With these you get a lot for your money, but the quality of the lash is poor. The bands are thick and are NOT flexible. The lashes look like cheap plastic. These would be great for a costume party, but are not the right look if you are going for a everyday natural look.</li>
    <li> Got these as a gift and I would not recommend this brand. Way too much adhesive on the lashes and it is impossible to remove not to mention time consuming. The bands are not flexible.</li>
    <li> Good for clients when you have on going work doing makeup.</li>
    <li> I do a lot of photo shoots and fashion shows (and other special events) so I needed a bulk set of eyelashes for models or MUAs who don&#x27;t bring their own.  My eyes are large with a very curved lid, but once you get them shaped properly to fit your eye, these can be worn a few times before you throw them out (if you have a good, flexible glue)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look great on the runway and in photos.</li>
    <li> Bought some for my daughter and myself and we both love them.  What a great price for the amount of lashes.</li>
    <li> my friends get so jealous when I whip out my box of eyelashes lol, and yeah they are a little stiff, but I personally just cut them to my eye size and they fit fine.</li>
    <li> They had a variety of different lashes but a lot of the lashes would be used more for halloween than going out. Also the more normal looking ones were really uncomfortable to wear.</li>
    <li> girlfriend always goes out and screams she should have bought some lashes. Bought this huge set and she was in love. She never screams she need lashes now lol. they are def NOT the quality as singles we have bought in the past from makeup counters or drug stores but it works great for us so were happy!</li>
    <li> Great product, great price</li>
    <li> 50 pairs of lashes for ten bucks? You can&#x27;t beat this deal. The lashes do seem a bit on the large size but they can be trimmed up just perfectly. Two of the styles are too dramatic for me, but I just gave them yo a friend. I also have a tip for those who feel the base of the lashea are too stiff - just take your fingernail and use a medium pressure to \\&quot;curl\\&quot; the band up a little before applying - kind of how you curl up ribbon for a gift, just not nearly as much pressure. They will be the perfect curve and much easier to apply once you do this :-)</li>
    <li> BOUGHT TWO SETS OF THESE FOR CHRISTMAS FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTERS AND THEY LOVE THEM! GREAT QUALITY EVEN GREATER PRICE!! I NEED TO BUY MYSELF A SET NOW!!</li>
    <li> I used these lashes for a runway show where I had lots of models to do makeup on. They were affordable but not quality at all. The bands were stiff and difficult to bend. Many of them broke in half or pieces as I tried to remove them from the packaging. Others had way to much adhesive on them. I would not buy them again.</li>
    <li> بصراحه خيآآآآآآل .. كثيره و احجامها مختلفهو و السعر مره مميز&lt;br /&gt;جربوها وكمان  انصحكم لو تشترو معاها رموش صغيره للي تحت العين&lt;br /&gt;و بالتوفيق ...</li>
    <li> Was very disappointed in these lashes.  They look great on the tray, but as soon as you start to pull them loose in order to apply them, the false lashes pull off the strip and you have nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a good value as it is a struggle to get them off the tray and applied without them coming apart, then when you remove them, more will pull off the end of the strip, making them a wear once and discard item.</li>
    <li> I just got into wearing fake eyelashes for fun! &amp; I took a risk ordering these. And I must say I love em. So easy to handle. :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recommend wearing these for anything else but costumes just like one night Halloween type thing they are super plastic and they look really fake and they&#x27;re super stiff and hard to keep on</li>
    <li> Hi Everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a professional makeup artist and I have to say I am more then impressed with these false lashes. I wasn&#x27;t sure how they would be when I decided to try them out but now I am so glad I did. As a MUA, I like to try different brands and products bc you just never know what you will find and what works. THESE LASHES WORK! I use them everytime I have a photo shoot and the models always ask me, where did you get them? They can&#x27;t believe how much I paid for them and how many they give you.&lt;br /&gt;There is only 1 set in here that I don&#x27;t use as often but to say the least, these are fantastic I def recommend anyone to get them :)</li>
    <li> I really love these. I don&#x27;t wear them more than once so its perfect to have a lot and not have them cost too much.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy these again.</li>
    <li> Some of them look plastic but since I&#x27;m a makeup artist and I have to use so many for different shows I work they reall come in handy</li>
    <li> I purchased these as a beginner . These are a quality buy, and they have some cool styles  - they can be trimmed a bit if too dramatic .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend them to a friend. I love love love them .. cant wait to order more . What an awesome value!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I like that the lashes comes in a neat packaging. The packaging is just cardboard but it fits in the box on little plastic sleeves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All eyelashes fit in the box. I like that I don&#x27;t have 100 different boxes of lashes.&lt;br /&gt;It has a good variety of lases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weft is a little big. It does not work well with DUO eyelash glue. I would suggest a wand glue in black it holds better.</li>
    <li> just as the title, if you like the very natural look then its not for you but if you apply them well, these do the job! I would buy again!</li>
    <li> I wear eyelashes all the time and these were the worst I have ever had. They don&#x27;t stick or curve to the eyes.</li>
    <li> These lashes are great! They can be compaired to Revlon brand and are soft and easy to fit on the eye lid. I use the Revlon eye lash glue and they stay on for several days with out getting grose.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift and she loved it!! So many different variety of lashes and the quailty was good</li>
    <li> Love the bundle- saved me a fortune- Great lashes that are reusable and I am able to change my look depending on the event..</li>
    <li> My neice is taking a makeup class, so I purchased these for her.  The lashes arrived earlier than expected. It has four varieties, it comes with a small tube of adhesive, and they are a deep sumptuous black.  We were pleased. I rated this a four because I feel they could be a tad bit softer. But hey, I am a big girl who understands you can&#x27;t have your way all the time.  Nevertheless we are quite content.</li>
    <li> They came in assorted styles and they were easy to apply. I was also able to reuse them so they lasted me a long time.</li>
    <li> 50 pairs and $13 so worth it!!!! I love them and but the only thing you gotta buy is the eyelash glue the glue that it came with its no good but the lashes are real cute and last all day</li>
    <li> I liked the lashes, I was excited when I got it and I didn&#x27;t feel ripped off. Lashes usually coast $5 for one pair but I got 50 pair for a good price</li>
    <li> The band on these if pretty stiff, so as a beginner, I don&#x27;t think this was a good buy.  I have a lot of difficulty putting them on compared to Ardell or MAC lashes.  As I watched a tutorial, though, it said if you can master these, you can master any lashes, so I do agree there.  But the look of the actual lashes, I love.</li>
    <li> PROS: good price, good variety, look good on, lashes are moveable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: the glue that comes with it is not adhesive at all, buy your own</li>
    <li> Love this eyelashes shipping wasen&#x27;t to long but there great for day and night :)! I&#x27;m in love with them, also 50 pairs for such a great price recommend :)</li>
    <li> These lashes are the perfect deal for anyone who wants to experiment or begin wearing false lashes. I&#x27;ve had mine for the past month &amp; a half &amp; love them. They&#x27;re reusable &amp; I haven&#x27;t ran through nearly a quarter of them. Easy to apply &amp; long lasting. I don&#x27;t use the glue that it comes with but DUO glue works perfect for not just these lashes but any lash brand.</li>
    <li> it was a christmas present for my sister. sh studed cosmotology/ she was really excited about the varity and for the price you cant beat it</li>
    <li> There are a lot of lashes for the price however they give you the tiniest bottle if adhesive which is not enough for all the lashes, I personally couldn&#x27;t get them to stay on either, maybe buy your own adhesive?</li>
    <li> The lashes were very hard to shape to the eye. Regardless of the several types of glue I used they absolutely refused to stay on my eye for more than a few seconds. They were a complete mess. ... I finally was able to contact the seller and they offered a refund, as long as I paid for the return shipping and the product was in a &#x27;completely unused&#x27; state. I obviously had tried out the product, or I wouldn&#x27;t have had to contact them in the first place due to the poor quality and issues I had. So there was NO way I was going to spend another $4 or so to ship them back to get NO refund. Be forewarned: this is not a good product and the seller has NO intention of supporting their customers. Definitely consider a different seller!</li>
    <li> I bought these purely for cosplay uses. I wanted a lot of variety and with the quantity I never have to worry about buying new lashes! I absolutely ADORE this purchase. The lashes are very comfortable. I have to snip them a little to fit my eyes better, but that&#x27;s not a complaint at all. The thicker ones are GREAT when I want to make my eyes pop out more, yet their natural enough that one could wear them for normal every day. I bought these lashes a year ago, granted I only use them for cosplay, but I&#x27;m still set for at least another year! If you wash them gently after using them, you can re-use pairs, which is what I&#x27;ve been doing. One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made on Amazon no doubt. The only thing I&#x27;d say is to not use the adhesive it comes with. Use DUO lash glue. It&#x27;s the best of it&#x27;s kind and hasn&#x27;t failed me yet :)</li>
    <li> love these they where fun just get your on glue to stick them and also the eyelash applicator tool makes it much easier .</li>
