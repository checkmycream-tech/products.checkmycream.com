      <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able to buy the pro size bottle on here because they don&#x27;t offer this size on the website or at any of the spas.</li>

      <li>I really love how this makes my skin feel.</li>
      <li>This product is up there in quality but that being said, I believe that Clinique 7-day scrub cream is even better.</li>
      <li>LOVE this cleanser.  </li>
      <li>I like it ,,,,But this is more  like a sun screen not a face moisturizer..</li>
      <li>Love this Murad product:)</li>
      <li>I LOVE it.  </li>
      <li>Very economical size!  </li>
      <li>I love Murad products and being able to get a professional size at a great price, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up.</li>
      <li>They acknowledged the problem, although I would have been more impressed with a partial refund for the product that was lost to me.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great exfoliation for my oily and sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Also, the pump allows you to use it in the shower easily.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Murad&#x27;s AHA/BHA Exfoliating Cleanser is wonderful because of the ultra fine grains that do the job but are gentle on the skin; also, for the lack of perfume, as perfume is an irritant for sensitive skin, like mine.</li>
      <li>Great product, price very reasonable and fast shipping.</li>
      <li>It has also helped with fine lines</li>
      <li>I especially love that it can be purchased in a large bottle for a terrific price!!  </li>
      <li>Love being able to buy the large size, too.</li>
      <li>Huge savings.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for aging skin and the occasional break out.</li>
      <li>keeps my face exfoliated and smooth.</li>
      <li>Great product, I definitely recommend it and will buy it again!</li>
      <li>More economical.</li>
      <li>But  definitely a fantastic product.  </li>
      <li>and this is a fabulous product.</li>
      <li>Great buy for this larger size.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the product on and off for 15 years--my favorite, gentle exfoliant; so I felt safe in ordering it.</li>
      <li>So far, so good.</li>
      <li>I love the product, use it frequently, and was happy to find it at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>My skin feels so smooth and fresh after I use this!</li>
      <li>Also love that it is available in a large size.</li>
      <li>and it definitely keeps my skin bright.</li>
      <li>The whole line is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>Bought the trial size and loved it, so I upgraded to the big bottle.  </li>
      <li>Seller just needs to change method of securing product and perhaps be more sympathetic to those of us who are cheated of product due to faulty securing of the pump top.</li>
      <li>This product makes your skin feel so wonderfully soft and clean!!  </li>
      <li>sure you use a sun screen in your moisturizer as this will make your skin more likely to be damaged by the UVA</li>
      <li>Skin is incredible cleansed and soft at the same time.</li>
      <li>Super in the shower for body exfoliating.  </li>
      <li>This bottle will last me a long time and it is definitely a great value!</li>
      <li>Is very rich and my skin feel super soft and radiant!</li>
      <li>My skin is so much clearer and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an esthetician and have access to lots of professional products , but this, along with Skinceuticals, is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>The bottle lasts me about six months, spit is worth the price.</li>
      <li>Murad AHA/BHA is ok so far.  </li>
      <li>When I found such a large amount at such a great price, I jumped on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like to purchase the bigger sizes because it is a much better deal.  </li>
      <li>Exactly as promised and arrived on time.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
      <li>I use this product daily and am pleased with the results and on line price.</li>
      <li>Plus it is reasonably priced &amp; anyone can use it!</li>
      <li>It helps our moisturizer to absorb deeper and gives better overall results.</li>
      <li>It is not super rough or strong on my face as others have experienced problems in this area.  </li>
      <li>and I guess that is a plus, but as far as fine lines not so much.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft and really clean.  </li>
      <li>I keep it on the countertop to my bathroom sink, as the pump makes dispensing it easy and the bottle, being white with no flashy labels, is not unsightly.</li>
      <li>It feels like your skin is new again!!  </li>
      <li>Love this cleanser - exfoliates gently without giving me dry skin after.  </li>
      <li>I love it because it&#x27;s gentle yet doesn&#x27;t dry when it exfoliates.  </li>
      <li>and that was a bit too much</li>
      <li>This is a gentle exfoliator, but it does the trick.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love MURAD products. Been using this cleanser for years and it definitely keeps my skin bright.</li>
    <li> its great cleans well gentle enough for everyday use.I have oily skin and have used this twice a day for around a month.&lt;br /&gt;Results no break outs ,pores are cleaner ,makeup stays put longer .&lt;br /&gt;At night I following up with a little coconut oil to moisturize&lt;br /&gt;age 53&lt;br /&gt;olive skin&lt;br /&gt;makeup wearer</li>
    <li> I use this product daily and am pleased with the results and on line price.</li>
    <li> Great buy for this larger size.</li>
    <li> Not sure why I bought this as I like the Murad gentle cleanser but I felt I needed something to kick it up a bit.&lt;br /&gt;So I now have both. My 67 year old skin is delicate and initially I was worried by the AHA/ BHA potency as well as the micro beads in the formula.&lt;br /&gt;I used it morning and night and that was a bit too much but now I use it in the morning and the gentle cleanser at night and it is a perfect combo.&lt;br /&gt;My skin texture is improved, the pores are much smaller in appearance and there seems to be a general softening of lines. Surprising, a product that works.&lt;br /&gt;I like the delivery system with the pump, very easy and you are not fooling around with getting caps back on while you have the product in your hands.&lt;br /&gt;Be sure you use a sun screen in your moisturizer as this will make your skin more likely to be damaged by the UVA but you should be using sunscreen on your face no matter what you use to cleanse your skin.</li>
    <li> I use this product every other day when I wash my face in the shower.  You would not use it everyday. Use your regular face wash on the off days.</li>
    <li> I have always enjoyed the benefits of this cleanser.  It leaves my skin feeling soft and really clean.  After several uses, my skin looks brighter.  I like to purchase the bigger sizes because it is a much better deal.  This bottle will last me a long time and it is definitely a great value!</li>
    <li> We have always been big fans of the Murad products. This one me and the hubby use 2-3 times a week to scrub off all the dead skin cells on our entire upper body and face, and use the vitamin c cleanser in between. It helps our moisturizer to absorb deeper and gives better overall results. It&#x27;s nice to be able to buy the pro size bottle on here because they don&#x27;t offer this size on the website or at any of the spas. Huge savings. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> Love this Murad product:) great price&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was a little slow and product leaked a little bit out of pump when I received but will buy again.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years so already knew what I was getting. The quality from the shipper was perfect...Live it in CA and got it in 2 days. No complaints here. Will be ordering it again for sure!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best deal I have ever seen on this stuff and equals out to a free small bottle if you are buying the small ones at around 20 - 25 dollars.</li>
    <li> I like this because it cleans my face really well.  I have had absolutely no problems with this at all.  However, I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference in my skin (no improvement).</li>
    <li> This product makes your skin feel so wonderfully soft and clean!!  It feels like your skin is new again!!  I especially love that it can be purchased in a large bottle for a terrific price!!  AWESOME!!</li>
    <li> I never want to be without this product. It has changed my skin for the better already. Only a small amount needed so this size should last a long time.</li>
    <li> I love Murad products and being able to get a professional size at a great price, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because of the reviews I saw on amazon!!!! No regrets!!! As soon I received this product from the first application my face feels wonderful! Is very rich and my skin feel super soft and radiant!</li>
    <li> Prefer buying this in larger size for cost savings. Product works great for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great after-makeup-is removed exfoliator.  Super in the shower for body exfoliating.  Men benefit using on their face as it exfoliates and helps reduce ingrown whiskers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the product on and off for 15 years--my favorite, gentle exfoliant; so I felt safe in ordering it. When I found such a large amount at such a great price, I jumped on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Murad&#x27;s AHA/BHA Exfoliating Cleanser is wonderful because of the ultra fine grains that do the job but are gentle on the skin; also, for the lack of perfume, as perfume is an irritant for sensitive skin, like mine. I hadn&#x27;t exfoliated for several week and used it 6 times in the past 2 weeks, followed by rich moisturizers and hydration, with baby-soft skin results. I&#x27;m 65 and have normal/medium oily skin, but it had been developing some dry patches recently. Now I will reduce that to 2x a week. I keep it on the countertop to my bathroom sink, as the pump makes dispensing it easy and the bottle, being white with no flashy labels, is not unsightly.</li>
    <li> I recently finished this bottle and I was not impressed. Will not be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser - exfoliates gently without giving me dry skin after.  Thank goodness they comes in larger pump bottles now so that I don&#x27;t have to reorder so often.  And dispensing in the shower is easier with the pump bottle.  Been using this cleanser for almost 2 years and still happy with it.</li>
    <li> I love the product, use it frequently, and was happy to find it at a reasonable price. That being said, there was a packaging issue in that the pump top had been pressed down and attempted to be secured by packaging tape. The pump had popped up by the time I received it with 4-5 TBS of product released throughout the box. I communicated with seller prior to leaving feedback. They acknowledged the problem, although I would have been more impressed with a partial refund for the product that was lost to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, product great, price good, shipping quick. Seller just needs to change method of securing product and perhaps be more sympathetic to those of us who are cheated of product due to faulty securing of the pump top.</li>
    <li> I love this facewash I will never use anything but this.  I have had acne my entire life.  This is the only product that keeps them at bay.  I have used it going on 10 years now.  I LOVE it.  And to get it at this size for this price.... you can&#x27;t go wrong.  Just keep in mind its an exfoliating cleanser... I think its mild enough for daily use but some people don&#x27;t think so.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several weeks. I have had no side effects, break-outs, or adverse reactions. So far, so good.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! The bottle lasts me 6 months. Price is very good.</li>
    <li> When I use this product I literally feel like my skin is breathing! Skin is incredible cleansed and soft at the same time. Not to mention that any product you put on your skin afterwards like a mask or moisturizer will be absorbed better and faster - or at least that&#x27;s how it feels to me. I&#x27;ve noticed that some blackheads just come out easier after using it. Great product, I definitely recommend it and will buy it again!</li>
    <li> I like it ,,,,But this is more  like a sun screen not a face moisturizer..&lt;br /&gt;They  were not clear about this,I do use it and will keep it. It leaves my skin and glowy..</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to love this product like I do.  My skin is so much clearer and smooth.  I wish I had tried this years ago.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had great success with this cleanser.  It is mildly exfoliating without extreme dryness. Will continue to use.  Also love that it is available in a large size. More economical.</li>
    <li> I use every day during summer.  But during winter have to cut back.  A little drying</li>
    <li> You can feel this product gently scrubbing and it give a little ting as you wash.  You only need a amount the barely the size of a dime!</li>
    <li> I have bought the entire anti aging system. It has helped tremendously with dry spots &amp; discoloration. It has also helped with fine lines</li>
    <li> I like this exfoliating cleanser a lot. I use it a few times each week. Very economical size!  Murad products are a mainstay for me.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful! I use it every 2-3 days in the shower to slough off the dead skin cells on my face &amp; keeps it feeling soft &amp; supple. What I especially like about this product is that it is a gentle exfoliant that doesn&#x27;t irritate or dry out my skin. Plus it is reasonably priced &amp; anyone can use it!</li>
    <li> My skin feels so smooth and fresh after I use this!</li>
    <li> The product is great &amp; after rinse, my skin feels a lot softer. Also, you cannot find a comparable product at this quantity for this price. This product is up there in quality but that being said, I believe that Clinique 7-day scrub cream is even better. I believe, the harsher the scrub feels , the more dead skin it removes.</li>
    <li> Smoothest face ever.  Bought the trial size and loved it, so I upgraded to the big bottle.  I use it every day and my daughter does too.  We have very smooth skin and this is a fabulous product.</li>
    <li> This is a gentle exfoliator, but it does the trick.  I use it every morning and it seems to take years off of my face.  I love it !</li>
    <li> Received a sample size of this product and fell in love with it so I went on and purchased this larger one.  Awesome for the skin !</li>
    <li> Very big bottle! Use it for face and body. Great exfoliation for my oily and sensitive skin. The best scrub I had!</li>
    <li> I really love how this makes my skin feel. I have aging, combo skin and this works wonderfully to help both of those issues. I also use it on my body; I have keratosis pilaris (a variant of eczema which causes pesky, little reddish bumps on the skin) and this helps tremendously. Great product!</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this cleanser.  I&#x27;ve had to add another cleanser that doesn&#x27;t have the beads in it to use regularly, as the beads offer a little too much exfoliation for twice daily use.  Tends to over exfoliate the epidermis.  But  definitely a fantastic product.  The whole line is my favorite.  I&#x27;m an esthetician and have access to lots of professional products , but this, along with Skinceuticals, is my favorite.  And affordable, too, which I LOVE!</li>
    <li> I have been using this exfoliating cleanser for years.  I love it because it&#x27;s gentle yet doesn&#x27;t dry when it exfoliates.  The large commercial size bottle is less expensive than buying the consumer size.  Also, the pump allows you to use it in the shower easily.</li>
    <li> Murad is #1 cleanser... have use this brand for 3 yrs.... all pro no con</li>
    <li> Great product, price very reasonable and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Works great! This cleanser works wonderfully at removing makeup. It&#x27;s great for aging skin and the occasional break out. Yay</li>
    <li> Murad never disappoints</li>
    <li> I use it every day and people always tell me how bright I look, how smooth my skin appears. The bottle lasts me about six months, spit is worth the price.</li>
    <li> Got this item and it looks different from the picture. It is not 16.9 oz. It is only 12 oz. Was dissapointed</li>
    <li> Purchased for my daughter as a replacement of a very expensive specialty cleanser. She has found the Murad Exfoliating cleanser to be equivalent if not superior to her other brand. This cleanser has not dried out her skin not caused any skin erruptions.</li>
    <li> I  love Murad products. I have used this product for 2 years now and my skin is smooth and bright.The big pump is so convient and is Perfect for morning and night use. And as always Amazon is the Best!</li>
    <li> I returned these products due to breaking out with welps after using.</li>
    <li> Exactly as promised and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Great for problem skin</li>
    <li> Murad AHA/BHA is ok so far.  I really have not noticed any change in my face and I use it 3 times a day.  It is not super rough or strong on my face as others have experienced problems in this area.  It has sort of helped with calming my acne down and I guess that is a plus, but as far as fine lines not so much.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff...!!! keeps my face exfoliated and smooth. Love being able to buy the large size, too. Saves me from having to make repeated purchases and from running out.</li>
