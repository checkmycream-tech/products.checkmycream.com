      <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>This one is just ok.</li>
      <li>well should have been much much better.</li>
      <li>If you want to keep your hair healthy and keep product build up to minimum, then this shampoo will do the trick.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>It smells nice and is excellent at getting rid of build-up that can occur with other shampoos or products.</li>
      <li>but I love how after I use it my hair is weightless, and feels SO CLEAN!</li>
      <li>I do like the squeaky clean feeling and my hair does look better.</li>
      <li>The shampoo smells fine, it lathers</li>
      <li>My hair is fine, and I must use some product to style it.  </li>
      <li>I have baby fine hair</li>
      <li>Fine bleached + henna&#x27;d hair.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several clarifying shampoos, including the acclaimed Fekkai Apple Cider one, and B+B&#x27;s is absolutely the best for my hair, which is fine but tends to need a lot of moisture.</li>
      <li>love this shampoo – perfect for hard water areas.</li>
      <li>It felt like a nice Sunday hair soap that really got my hair free of impurities after I rinsed it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it once a week for several years, and it does a great job.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is light to nonexistent...</li>
      <li>My hair has more volume and feels super clean.</li>
      <li>Great for fine hair--cleans without making your hair dry or brittle.</li>
      <li>However it also leaves the hair squeaky clean, removing all built-ups.</li>
      <li>That being said, there&#x27;s always a bunch of build up when it&#x27;s time to wash - this shampoo makes your hair squeaky clean without over drying.  </li>
      <li>It has a light, fresh scent, lathers well, and does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
      <li>I love it and highly recommend it to all product junkies.</li>
      <li>It lathers well, and makes your hair soft again, because all the junk is out of your hair right after using this amazing shampoo.  </li>
      <li>After using B&amp;B Sunday shampoo for the 1st time, it became SUPER soft, I didn&#x27;t need to douse it with hair products like I usually do, and it just sat lusciously, in these nice, huge retro waves!!!  </li>
      <li>Very light nice smelling shampoo that can be used everyday.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased other BB products and have been very satisfied.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo is pricey, and it has some fragrance I could live without, but it does clean product buildup out of hair.  </li>
      <li>I love using this and following with a masque-type conditioner.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s designed to remove build up in either one wash, or if you want - and they do say you don&#x27;t need to - a second wash just to be sure.  </li>
      <li>Seems as though my hairdresser gave me something that worked just as well and certainly is not as expensive.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use a lot of hair products -- mostly serums and the occasional smoothing balm -- but I do swim often, and I haven&#x27;t found another shampoo that gets the chlorine smell and feel out on the first wash.</li>
      <li>It has the slightest of fragrance (very fresh and natural) and you don&#x27;t need a lot.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo really made a difference after the first use.  </li>
      <li>It really gets your hair clean while leaving it soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>I definitely would not recommend this product for processed or fine hair.  </li>
      <li>As a man, I have not given much thought to the dizzying array of shampoo choices for much of my life... to the detriment of my hair.    </li>
      <li>It really gets your hair \\&quot;squeaky\\</li>
      <li>This stuff work very well</li>
      <li>It takes forever to blow it out, so I don&#x27;t wash it very often.</li>
      <li>stars, because it costs too much, but I do recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Expected more.</li>
      <li>I use a lot of products to smooth my hair out, which essentially leaves me with a lot of buildup.</li>
      <li>Expected more for a BB product.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think it cleaned very well-</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried more than half a dozen clarifying shampoos to get chlorine, campfire smoke, and everyday build up out of my hair, and this is, hands down, the best on the market.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say how this would work for very thick hair, but for my fine, somewhat dry, sort of frizz-prone hair this stuff is a great once-a-week treat.</li>
      <li>&quot; clean so if you have a lot of product build up, then this will definitely get the job done and remove</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also a must-have for camping trips; fire smoke can linger for days with other shampoos, but Sunday Shampoo gets you squeaky clean right away.</li>
      <li>This is a decent product to use after swimming in a chlorinated pool.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>does a decent job of removing the dulling effects of some medications.</li>
      <li>I highly suggest it</li>
      <li>great shampoo for oily hair; expensive</li>
      <li>My hair is shiny and soft after using this shampoo, yet I can still go 2 full days before my next shampoo without getting oily roots.</li>
      <li>This lathers really well, and gets the hair clean without leaving it feeling stripped and dried out.</li>
      <li>Your hair is a little hard to manage the first day after, but it&#x27;s shiny clean, soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>Deep cleansing, it washes the hair really well.</li>
      <li>I use it once a week and all the hairspray and gook and pollution is gone completely.</li>
      <li>It is naturally wavy</li>
      <li>i used the same amount that i use for my shampoo and i had so much lather.  </li>
      <li>Think of it like stripping old varnish off your coffee table --</li>
      <li>In the past I&#x27;ve used Suave, but I can&#x27;t find their clarifying shampoo locally any more, so I had to try something</li>

    <li> LOVE BUMBLE AND BUMBLE!</li>
    <li> Did the job without stripping my hair dry</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several clarifying shampoos, including the acclaimed Fekkai Apple Cider one, and B+B&#x27;s is absolutely the best for my hair, which is fine but tends to need a lot of moisture. I love using this and following with a masque-type conditioner. My hair is shiny and soft after using this shampoo, yet I can still go 2 full days before my next shampoo without getting oily roots.

It&#x27;s also a must-have for camping trips; fire smoke can linger for days with other shampoos, but Sunday Shampoo gets you squeaky clean right away.</li>
    <li> I would give it a 10 if I could. Ive tried Pureology, u name it. I have hard water and have always had greasy hair. I am a white female but just always had a hard time getting the shamposs out of my hair thus creating a greasy gross looking mess. I have used this now for a month and it is PHENOMINAL!!! I highly recommend it! If I could post a before and after pic I would &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never really tried clarifying shampoos so i can&#x27;t say that i can compare but i was v satisfied with it.  I can say, however, that a little does go a long way. i used the same amount that i use for my shampoo and i had so much lather.  I do like the squeaky clean feeling and my hair does look better. I did change several other products i use so i cant honestly attribute the better looking hair to this shampoo.  I am going to buy it again just for that squeaky feeling. :D</li>
    <li> Overall I think this is a good shampoo, my hair did not feel dry like with other clarifiers, how ever it did not not eliminate all my build up, but, I am a product junkie &amp; I only wash my hair every few days &amp; also have hard water. I think for most people this would do the trick!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is pricey, and it has some fragrance I could live without, but it does clean product buildup out of hair.  My hair is fine, and I must use some product to style it.  Of course, eventually product starts weighing my hair down.  Then I need to use a clarifying shampoo.  In the past I&#x27;ve used Suave, but I can&#x27;t find their clarifying shampoo locally any more, so I had to try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunday Shampoo works.  I only need one wash, no repeat, just like it says on the label.  Now I can get my hair back to fluffy again.  I use this only occasionally, so it&#x27;s going to last a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four stars, because it costs too much, but I do recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Now two stars because the price is over $30 per bottle.  I would not recommend any shampoo at that price!</li>
    <li> I cyberstalked this clarifying shampoo for almost a year before buying it, I hate to admit.  I read a review which made me fear that it might do strange things to my colored hair.  But I just found it on sale at nordstrom rack (yeah sorry, didn&#x27;t buy it on Amazon like I should&#x27;ve... Amazon ALWAYS has the lowest prices!!!) and FELL IN LOVE!!!    My hair is long, thick, and islander.  After using B&amp;B Sunday shampoo for the 1st time, it became SUPER soft, I didn&#x27;t need to douse it with hair products like I usually do, and it just sat lusciously, in these nice, huge retro waves!!!  &#x3D;D      Moral of the Story: Though reviews are extremely helpful, sometimes you&#x27;ve just gotta go find out for yourself  ;)</li>
    <li> This product makes your hair feel refreshed after a long week or styling and products.  It felt like a nice Sunday hair soap that really got my hair free of impurities after I rinsed it.  The shampoo reminded me of soap because it has a good amount of suds and smelled clean.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even worry about my hair dye with this shampoo.  It pulls out the gunk while leaving my color intact.</li>
    <li> Hello, I am a man.  As a man, I have not given much thought to the dizzying array of shampoo choices for much of my life... to the detriment of my hair.    This shampoo is awesome for the following reasons:    1.  It will get rid of all the gel, pomade, hair cream, mud, oil, twigs, grass, and bird doo that has accumulated on your head during a productive day.    2.  The fragrance is light to nonexistent... you will not smell like an apple or a gummy bear.  If you have a nice smelling gel or styling product, this ensures no clash of scents.    3.  The lather has cleansing power, you can literally feel your hair getting cleaner and finer and softer.  Compare this to other thick shampoos that are all bubbles and goo but still leaves you feeling sticky in the end.    4.  It is not a volumising shampoo.  For some reason those shampoos make my head smell like a sock by the end of the day.  Not sure why.    That is all.  I need this at the end of every day before sleepy time.</li>
    <li> If you are like me, and use hair creme&#x27;s and other styling products that can leave build up in your hair, then this product is for you.  It&#x27;s designed to remove build up in either one wash, or if you want - and they do say you don&#x27;t need to - a second wash just to be sure.  It has the slightest of fragrance (very fresh and natural) and you don&#x27;t need a lot.  It lathers well, and makes your hair soft again, because all the junk is out of your hair right after using this amazing shampoo.  It&#x27;s one of the best build-up removing shampoos I&#x27;ve ever used and it&#x27;s so softening.  You shouldn&#x27;t need it much more than once a week, but sometimes I use it twice.  I love it and highly recommend it to all product junkies.</li>
    <li> Pros:  The product does what it claims and gets rid of product build up.  It really gets your hair \\&quot;squeaky\\&quot; clean so if you have a lot of product build up, then this will definitely get the job done and remove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  However, this product stripped my hair of critical moisture and nutrients and ultimately damaged my hair even though I followed the directions and used the recommended amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I have mixed feelings about the product.  It does what it claims but I would use caution using it.  I definitely would not recommend this product for processed or fine hair.  I would suggest doing a test area to make sure that it doesn&#x27;t damage your hair.</li>
    <li> Fine bleached + henna&#x27;d hair.  I use it once a month before re-coloring.  This shampoo is really only meant to be used once in a while. It really does strip out all of the chlorine, hard water minerals and metals, and silcone product build up.  SO! If you use a lot of silicone-based smoothing/detangling products (conditioners, leave ins, shine balms/sprays) your hair will feel really bad until you stuff moisture back in.  Think of it like stripping old varnish off your coffee table -- the wood underneath wasn&#x27;t getting natural oils and moisture because the varnish blocked it, so it will feel really dry until you perk it back up again.  I use this before I cassia-dye my hair (it&#x27;s like henna), because the iron build up in my tap water can make the color go from the intended pale gold to off-green!  This shampoo makes that a non-issue.</li>
    <li> I tried this because it was recommended as a good clarifying shampoo by Paula Begoun, the \\&quot;Cosmetics Cop.\\&quot;  I&#x27;ve used it once a week for several years, and it does a great job.  I use lots of styling products in my hair, so it removes build-up.  I&#x27;ve had my hair black, red, and blonde, and it doesn&#x27;t strip or alter my color.  A bit expensive, but lasts a long time cause you shouldn&#x27;t use it every time you shampoo.</li>
    <li> Expected more for a BB product.  It works well.  But does not smell particularly good or does anything particularly special to my hair.  I&#x27;ve purchased other BB products and have been very satisfied.  This one is just ok.</li>
    <li> My hair has never been any cleaner after using this. It takes all the residue from my other shampoos/ products out. Doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my hair out, either. I like to use it one to two times a week. It&#x27;s expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. It smells nice and is excellent at getting rid of build-up that can occur with other shampoos or products. I don&#x27;t use it everyday (that would be expensive!) but I love how after I use it my hair is weightless, and feels SO CLEAN!</li>
    <li> does a good job of removing product without overdrying.  I can&#x27;t usually use clarifying shampoos because they make my hair feel like straw.  I only shampoo every 3-4 days so I use it once every other week and keeps the product from buildinig up.</li>
    <li> Really great shampoo - it lifts a lot of the build-up on gray hair (sprays, gels, etc.) and isn&#x27;t harsh.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. Great for fine hair--cleans without making your hair dry or brittle.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I use a lot of products to smooth my hair out, which essentially leaves me with a lot of buildup. This shampoo works great to wash it all away. My hair has more volume and feels super clean. It has a light, fresh scent, lathers well, and does what it&#x27;s supposed to. A+</li>
    <li> great shampoo for oily hair; expensive</li>
    <li> A weekly must!  Awesome stuff</li>
    <li> This shampoo was recommended to me by my hair stylist. She said I had tons of build up and that&#x27;s why my hair was so tangly. I also always shampoo my hair twice (sometimes even three times) even though it&#x27;s shoulder length, and still sometimes once I&#x27;ve dried it I find greasy areas. I don&#x27;t use any hair products other than dry shampoo, but she said the parabens from my crappy grocery store shampoo cause build up. So I bought this very expensive shampoo and used it three washes in a row. I see no difference at all in my hair. The shampoo smells fine, it lathers alright I suppose. But I can use my $3 Herbal Essences and get the exact same effect so.... not impressed. Everyone else seems to love it, so maybe it is effective for removing styling products (just not crappy shampoo build up).</li>
    <li> Best shampoo for weekly removal of hair product residue, keeps hair shiny and healthy.</li>
    <li> Great weekly cleaner to get all the product out of your hair. Especially good for those who swim in chlorine often.</li>
    <li> this is the best shampoo to get everything out of your hair  i use it 3 times a week good conditioner after wow your hair will look great</li>
    <li> Expected more. It leaves the hair frizzy and dry. It also strips the color. However it also leaves the hair squeaky clean, removing all built-ups.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Due to extremely thick hair, I don&#x27;t wash it everyday and was introduced to dry shampoo.  That being said, there&#x27;s always a bunch of build up when it&#x27;s time to wash - this shampoo makes your hair squeaky clean without over drying.  After using this shampoo, I can usually get an extra day without washing my hair!</li>
    <li> I use this as a restart for my hair on sundays. This stuff work very well so make sure you have a good conditioner to follow. I cleanses my hair of all impurities.</li>
    <li> This is a decent product to use after swimming in a chlorinated pool.&lt;br /&gt;Also does a decent job of removing the dulling effects of some medications.</li>
    <li> For deep cleaning once a week is perfect.</li>
    <li> I am not so sure that I would order this again.  Seems as though my hairdresser gave me something that worked just as well and certainly is not as expensive.</li>
    <li> leaves hair very flat when you use it  don&#x27;t like that. I like my hair to have lift on top</li>
    <li> Your hair is super-clean after you use this. I use it once a week and all the hairspray and gook and pollution is gone completely. Your hair is a little hard to manage the first day after, but it&#x27;s shiny clean, soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> love this shampoo – perfect for hard water areas.</li>
    <li> Deep cleansing, it washes the hair really well. Perfect to use before a hydration treatment :)</li>
    <li> Very light nice smelling shampoo that can be used everyday. I love it. Bumble &amp; Bumble products are great and affordable.</li>
    <li> If you want to keep your hair healthy and keep product build up to minimum, then this shampoo will do the trick.  I use it weekly and it delivers on the promise!</li>
    <li> Probably my favorite of all the Bumble &amp; Bumble products.  It really gets your hair clean while leaving it soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick hair. It is naturally wavy and I like to straighten it, so I use a heat styling product. It takes forever to blow it out, so I don&#x27;t wash it very often. Between washes I use dry shampoo and anti-humidity spray. When I do wash it, I need something cleansing that can remove the styling product buildup. This lathers really well, and gets the hair clean without leaving it feeling stripped and dried out.</li>
    <li> I have baby fine hair so all the products I have to use everyday, build up quickly.  This shampoo really made a difference after the first use.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan. I didn&#x27;t think it cleaned very well- it left a lot of residue, and for the price it bloody well should have been much much better. I&#x27;ve never tried a B&amp;B product that lived up to its claims, so I guess I&#x27;ll just save the money and not buy the brand anymore</li>
    <li> this is a great shampoo to use once a week to get all the &amp;#34;yuck: out of your hair.  I highly suggest it</li>
