      <li>This stuff is AMAZING!</li>
      <li>I love all the Cjs butters and this spray is great!</li>
      <li>Before this we had the CJ&#x27;s BUTTer unscented and we loved it.  </li>
      <li>I have PUPPPs (Pregnancy Rash) and figured that if this stuff is supposed to be great for baby and cloth-diaper safe, that it would be good for me too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Her bottom looks happy and healthy.</li>
      <li>She immediately asked me where she could buy more!</li>
      <li>Now I kind of like it.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how handy the spray format would be for one.</li>
      <li>cause I love the no touch aspect of it and some of their scents look like they would smell really good.</li>
      <li>The absolute best stuff we&#x27;ve found - and cloth diaper safe as well.  </li>
      <li>I love that it sprays on because then I don&#x27;t have to get it all over my hands.</li>
      <li>I know that I bought this (and the tub o butter) because they are both CD safe</li>
      <li>when I saw that this product was cloth diaper safe and was supossed to treat for yeast I decided I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I bought another container that has a better sprayer and put it in that to get the mist effect.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cloth diaper safe.</li>
      <li>I use cloth diapers, and this spray is cloth diaper safe.</li>
      <li>Bought it because it&#x27;s cloth diaper safe.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>The spray also doesn&#x27;t burn like most rash treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I will use again and I have bought this for many friends with babies.</li>
      <li>and i love being able to just spray it and not get anything on my hands.</li>
      <li>I will update my review when I try it on my baby too :)</li>
      <li>Love this for treating yeast rash.</li>
      <li>I love this product</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
      <li>It is NOT the scented kind, it is just the original.    </li>
      <li>It works fast and is amazing for yeast rashes!</li>
      <li>I am thinking maybe it will be good to use for a couple of weeks to really make sure the yeast is gone.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE that it is perfume and dye free.</li>
      <li>love this company and their products but will not make the mistake of ordering the original scent again</li>
      <li>However, if the product had worked for the yeast I would have been fine with the smell.  </li>
      <li>that its CD safe for when coconut oil by itself is not cutting it for a rash.</li>
      <li>The idea that sold me on this was to use it when your baby is sensitive to the touch.. great theory, but with the high power spray it&#x27;s not that &amp;#34;soothing&amp;#34; :)</li>
      <li>Gotta love it ;)</li>
      <li>Totally worth buying!</li>
      <li>cause I really wanted to like it, but it never was able to kill the yeast.  </li>
      <li>Because there&#x27;s no label on the back of the bottle, it has no dosing instructions, no &amp;#34;keep at room temperature&amp;#34; type label, or anything to remind you of what this is good for.&lt;br</li>
      <li>got rid of my baby&#x27;s diaper rash quickly</li>
      <li>It is fast and easy to put on during diaper changes with a squirmy 1-year-old.</li>
      <li>This stuff is the only thing that clears up my daughter&#x27;s rashes and it is cloth diaper safe!</li>
      <li>not crazy about the smell but its not terrible.&lt;br /&gt;love</li>
      <li>I just wish I got the right product in the first place.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Obviously this isnt a fault with the product, but buyers should be aware of the issue.</li>
      <li>My daughter&#x27;s rash cleared up within a day or two of starting the &amp;#34;plus&amp;#34; version, and I&#x27;ve continued using it at most of her changes for prevention.</li>
      <li>Haha!</li>
      <li>Before my daughter was born, I was very committed to the idea of using cloth diapers, and searched high and low for a diaper rash cream that would be effective at protecting her skin, and that would not compromise the absorbency of the cloth diapers.</li>
      <li>one of my grandchildren is sensitive to coconut oil, so this doesn&#x27;t work for him, but it&#x27;s good for the other 3.</li>
      <li>It is very liquidy, and just kind of runs down his bottom rather than stay put where you spray it.</li>
      <li>This seems to help my baby hen he gets a certain type of rash on this bottom</li>
      <li>I use a jar of coconut oil for changing at home, but this spray works just as well on my infant who has eczema and is very convenient in the spray form.  </li>
      <li>(again, it helps me stop itching, so I can&#x27;t complain too much), but it smells like rancid nut-oil.  </li>
      <li>The smell is a bit intense, but you get used to it.  </li>
      <li>This in and of itself makes me more likely to use it frequently.</li>
      <li>We love CJ&#x27;s, and this product came in handy (big time) when my son had a serious case of diarrhea that had us changing diapers and wiping his sore bottom every 20-30 minutes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m no longer using cloth diapers, which opens up my options to many other diaper creams I could not use otherwise, and</li>
      <li>I love that this is so easy to use but the spray is less mist and more of a jet spray on my poor son&#x27;s genitals.</li>
      <li>The smell is odd, but not terrible.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately it does not smell great.  </li>
      <li>I got this spray for my sons diaper rash it only works on minor rashes which is ok.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to try it on my baby yet, but my dog has extremely dry skin especially on her nose, we live in the desert</li>
      <li>other Cj&#x27;s products are perfect but this stuff smells weird.</li>
      <li>so I just added a little TTO and GSE to the Spritz and it has been working fine.  </li>
      <li>over it has been working to clear it up</li>
      <li>I have been dealing with a persistant yeast diaper rash on my 6 month old daughter.  </li>
      <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try to use the spray once the rash is completely gone</li>
      <li>We love our monkey farts cjs butter however this &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; really smells horrible, works great but smells awful.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Now we use this only when our little one gets an occasional rash, and we use the regular butter (warm vanilla cake) for every change.  </li>
      <li>BUTTer Spritz in the natural mango mint scent, and while I prefer that one for fragrance, this one wins for effectiveness hands down.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend the CJ&#x27;s BUTTer, but get the regular unscented not the &amp;#34;plus.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I use on red areas on my LO bottom and the next diaper change area is always clear!</li>
      <li>really love that it is spray because it can get so messy dealing with holding the baby on the table with messy fingers and trying not to get cream everywhere.  </li>
      <li>I love the idea of this product but cannot handle the smell, to be it is strong and very unpleasant</li>
      <li>So easy to spray on little bottoms without getting your hands yucky with messy creams.</li>

<li> I will definitely buy again when I use this entire bottle - but it will take me awhile as it lasts a long time.  </li>
<li> It is a little nutty but not very strong at all, unless you are sticking your nose right in it.  </li>
<li> Yes, its made of coconut, shea butter, and other natural oils, but my bottle smells like oil that has sat out too long.  </li>
<li> I have used it on diaper rash, scrapes, cuts, pimples, dry skin, eczema.  </li>
<li> I will say that the container it comes in makes the spray shoot out very hard in a straight line, not a mist.  </li>
<li> Desitin made my daughter&#x27;s rash about 10 times worse, so I&#x27;m very thankful for CJ&#x27;s.</li>
<li> I do plan to try some of the CJs spritz in other scents</li>
<li> I have this spray (purchased from their website) in a few other scents and LOOOOVE it!</li>
<li> If I had my choice though, I wish it were a little thicker, a little closer to a lotion consistency.</li>
<li> This is a little bit off topic from what this is meant to be used for.</li>
<li> She can get them pretty bad with her oversensitive bum.</li>
<li> I gave her a small spray bottle with some of this in it to take home after I babysat for her.</li>
<li> I am not sure if it is the neem oil or the hemp oil</li>
<li> It gets rid of that angry surrounding red within a couple of hours.</li>
<li> Not sure what ingredient makes the odor</li>
<li> Plus my hands don&#x27;t get messy!</li>
<li> This spray is the only thing I use when treating my daughters random rashes.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> got rid of my baby&#x27;s diaper rash quickly and i love being able to just spray it and not get anything on my hands.</li>
    <li> The picture is wrong. It is NOT the scented kind, it is just the original.    And yes, it smells weird.    It does help redness and the spray is convenient.</li>
    <li> Totally worth buying! I love this product</li>
    <li> I keep this spray in my diaper bag for changing diapers on the go.  I use a jar of coconut oil for changing at home, but this spray works just as well on my infant who has eczema and is very convenient in the spray form.  I will definitely buy again when I use this entire bottle - but it will take me awhile as it lasts a long time.  I LOVE that it is perfume and dye free.</li>
    <li> I was worried about the smell of the product after reading the reviews but I did not find the smell to be bad at all!  It is a little nutty but not very strong at all, unless you are sticking your nose right in it.  I will say that the container it comes in makes the spray shoot out very hard in a straight line, not a mist.  I bought another container that has a better sprayer and put it in that to get the mist effect.</li>
    <li> This is a little bit off topic from what this is meant to be used for. I haven&#x27;t been able to try it on my baby yet, but my dog has extremely dry skin especially on her nose, we live in the desert so it always looks dirty and dry. I sprayed some of this on and her nose looks so moisturized now!! Haha! I plan to use it for my husband&#x27;s bad eczema too when it flares up. I will update my review when I try it on my baby too :)</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING! It works well for cloth diapers and has a wonderful smell.</li>
    <li> I have PUPPPs (Pregnancy Rash) and figured that if this stuff is supposed to be great for baby and cloth-diaper safe, that it would be good for me too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;While I have not tested on baby, it seems to spray out and helps me with the PUPPPs rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The bottle/packaging has no labeling.  The only label on the bottle is the one that is on the front.  I know that I bought this (and the tub o butter) because they are both CD safe but I remember them being recommended for different things.  Because there&#x27;s no label on the back of the bottle, it has no dosing instructions, no &amp;#34;keep at room temperature&amp;#34; type label, or anything to remind you of what this is good for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I have a bad batch (again, it helps me stop itching, so I can&#x27;t complain too much), but it smells like rancid nut-oil.  Yes, its made of coconut, shea butter, and other natural oils, but my bottle smells like oil that has sat out too long.  Or, maybe it&#x27;s supposed to smell like that.</li>
    <li> Before my daughter was born, I was very committed to the idea of using cloth diapers, and searched high and low for a diaper rash cream that would be effective at protecting her skin, and that would not compromise the absorbency of the cloth diapers. I&#x27;m no longer using cloth diapers, which opens up my options to many other diaper creams I could not use otherwise, and yet I&#x27;ll be sticking with this one. I didn&#x27;t realize how handy the spray format would be for one. This in and of itself makes me more likely to use it frequently. The formula itself is excellent. I&#x27;ve tried the regular CJs BUTTer Spritz in the natural mango mint scent, and while I prefer that one for fragrance, this one wins for effectiveness hands down. My daughter&#x27;s rash cleared up within a day or two of starting the &amp;#34;plus&amp;#34; version, and I&#x27;ve continued using it at most of her changes for prevention. Her bottom looks happy and healthy. For the period during which I tried cloth diapers, this did not harm them at all. Now, even though I don&#x27;t need the cloth-friendliness of this butter, I&#x27;ll be sticking with it just because of how well it works.</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected and arrived early</li>
    <li> one of my grandchildren is sensitive to coconut oil, so this doesn&#x27;t work for him, but it&#x27;s good for the other 3.</li>
    <li> not crazy about the smell but its not terrible.&lt;br /&gt;love that its CD safe for when coconut oil by itself is not cutting it for a rash.</li>
    <li> Love this for treating yeast rash.</li>
    <li> This seems to help my baby hen he gets a certain type of rash on this bottom</li>
    <li> This stuff is the only thing that clears up my daughter&#x27;s rashes and it is cloth diaper safe! I love that it sprays on because then I don&#x27;t have to get it all over my hands. Desitin made my daughter&#x27;s rash about 10 times worse, so I&#x27;m very thankful for CJ&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> The ad states unscented, yet I was sent lavender and tea tree oil.&lt;br /&gt;Obviously this isnt a fault with the product, but buyers should be aware of the issue.</li>
    <li> I use cloth diapers, and this spray is cloth diaper safe. It is fast and easy to put on during diaper changes with a squirmy 1-year-old. It works fast and is amazing for yeast rashes! The spray also doesn&#x27;t burn like most rash treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend has a son the same age as mine. She uses disposable diapers and he had a terrible rash for about 2 weeks.  I gave her a small spray bottle with some of this in it to take home after I babysat for her. She used it twice and his rash cleared up! She immediately asked me where she could buy more!</li>
    <li> I got this spray for my sons diaper rash it only works on minor rashes which is ok. But oh my goodness this stuff stinks even though it says unscented, I can&#x27;t use it too often because I just can&#x27;t handle the smell.</li>
    <li> other Cj&#x27;s products are perfect but this stuff smells weird. I have the Plus in the 12oz tub and it doesn&#x27;t smell like this stuff. I returned it after one squirt.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Works great. It&#x27;s cloth diaper safe. Plus my hands don&#x27;t get messy! What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
    <li> We love our monkey farts cjs butter however this &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; really smells horrible, works great but smells awful.&lt;br /&gt;We love this company and their products but will not make the mistake of ordering the original scent again</li>
    <li> I love the idea of this product but cannot handle the smell, to be it is strong and very unpleasant</li>
    <li> It was rather runny, which made it difficult to keep where I wanted it.</li>
    <li> This stuff works for everything and is safe for cloth diapers!!  I have used it on diaper rash, scrapes, cuts, pimples, dry skin, eczema.  It clears it all up!  Unfortunately it does not smell great.  I am not sure if it is the neem oil or the hemp oil that smells weird- green and nutty- but you get over it.  It works great on any skin issue.  I will use again and I have bought this for many friends with babies.</li>
    <li> This spray is awesome, but not in this scent! I have this spray (purchased from their website) in a few other scents and LOOOOVE it! So easy to spray on little bottoms without getting your hands yucky with messy creams. Bought it because it&#x27;s cloth diaper safe. I bought this one as an extra for the diaper bag, but it smells really gross to me. I&#x27;d totally recommend this product, but go to their website where there&#x27;s lots of options on different scents!</li>
    <li> We had to throw it away.  Not sure what ingredient makes the odor but it was just terrible.  Before this we had the CJ&#x27;s BUTTer unscented and we loved it.  Spritzed it after every diaper change and never a rash.  I highly recommend the CJ&#x27;s BUTTer, but get the regular unscented not the &amp;#34;plus.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Cleared up a yeast rash when nothing else would work.  The smell is a bit intense, but you get used to it.  Now I kind of like it.  Now we use this only when our little one gets an occasional rash, and we use the regular butter (warm vanilla cake) for every change.  The absolute best stuff we&#x27;ve found - and cloth diaper safe as well.  I&#x27;ve recommended it to a number of my mom friends.</li>
    <li> I love that this is so easy to use but the spray is less mist and more of a jet spray on my poor son&#x27;s genitals. The idea that sold me on this was to use it when your baby is sensitive to the touch.. great theory, but with the high power spray it&#x27;s not that &amp;#34;soothing&amp;#34; :)</li>
    <li> This spray is the only thing I use when treating my daughters random rashes. She can get them pretty bad with her oversensitive bum. This stuff will help her out within 24 hours. It gets rid of that angry surrounding red within a couple of hours. It is amazing! I love it. The smell makes me feel like an awesome tree hugger too. Gotta love it ;)</li>
    <li> I have been dealing with a persistant yeast diaper rash on my 6 month old daughter.  I have been trying various creams, over the counter and perscrption.  We use cloth diapers but I switched over to disposables while dealing with all of the various creams.  I was getting tired of spending money on disposables so when I saw that this product was cloth diaper safe and was supossed to treat for yeast I decided I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love that it is spray because it can get so messy dealing with holding the baby on the table with messy fingers and trying not to get cream everywhere.  I do agree that the smell is very unpleasant.  However, if the product had worked for the yeast I would have been fine with the smell.  I tried this over and over again and everytime I used it my daughters rash looked worse.  I kept trying cause I really wanted to like it, but it never was able to kill the yeast.  Store brand lotrimin with a layer of purple destin over it has been working to clear it up now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try to use the spray once the rash is completely gone and we are back to cloth.  I am thinking maybe it will be good to use for a couple of weeks to really make sure the yeast is gone.  I know different yeast strains respond to different things so maybe in the future it would work (hopefully we won&#x27;t have anymore yeast rashes to try it on).  I do plan to try some of the CJs spritz in other scents cause I love the no touch aspect of it and some of their scents look like they would smell really good.</li>
    <li> Works well. The smell is odd, but not terrible. I use on red areas on my LO bottom and the next diaper change area is always clear!</li>
    <li> Works well, but smells like peanut oil.  I cant stand the smell..</li>
    <li> I love all the Cjs butters and this spray is great! The neem oil is great for skin and prevents infections. The smell is not offensive just not babyish. Smells like kitchen spices or something similar. My LO loves that it is a spray he giggles when I apply it.</li>
    <li> We love CJ&#x27;s, and this product came in handy (big time) when my son had a serious case of diarrhea that had us changing diapers and wiping his sore bottom every 20-30 minutes. If I had my choice though, I wish it were a little thicker, a little closer to a lotion consistency. It is very liquidy, and just kind of runs down his bottom rather than stay put where you spray it. If that makes sense...</li>
    <li> I ordered the Spritz O Butter Plus because I needed it for my daughter&#x27;s yeasty diaper rashes.  Unfortunately I received the plain CJs BUTTer Spritz.  I was going to try to return it but that was a pain so I just added a little TTO and GSE to the Spritz and it has been working fine.  I just wish I got the right product in the first place.</li>
