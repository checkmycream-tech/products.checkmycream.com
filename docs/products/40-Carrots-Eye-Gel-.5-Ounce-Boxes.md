<ol>
      <li>Best eye gel I have ever used.</li>
      <li>VERY happy with this and will buy again!  </li>
      <li>I use it morning and night, it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and the bottle size is perfect for travel.</li>
      <li>I have been using all of the 40 Carrots for a while now they are excellent.  </li>
      <li>great stuff for puffy eyes</li>
      <li>Great for Under eyes.</li>
      <li>Works great on puffiness.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this eye gel because it is a great vitamin C product.</li>
      <li>LOL</li>
      <li>40 Carrots Eye Gel is a good product...</li>
      <li>This is a good product for the price.</li>
      <li>This product is good.  </li>
      <li>and we all like the good ingredients.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>The ingredients aren&#x27;t very healthy for your skin, lot&#x27;s of chemicals.</li>
      <li>It is an amazing price &amp; works miracles.</li>
      <li>I love this product - it feels so good on my face.  </li>
      <li>Love the value and love the product!</li>
      <li>First three times, it felt great, and I could feel it tightening my skin.</li>
      <li>if it feels drying or if it&#x27;s drying your skin out, it&#x27;s because you are STILL supposed to put a moisturizer on top of it.</li>
      <li>but i love the rest of this line of 40 carrots including the shampoo</li>
      <li>Ok</li>
      <li>I love the way this product makes your eyes feel tightened as if you have a mask on just after you apply.</li>
      <li>Ok here&#x27;s the trick ladies..</li>
      <li>I thought maybe it means it is working, then the three days after, it continued to burn more and more</li>
      <li>I even tried to make sure it was just the product and nothing else that I used...put it on just my forehead...</li>
      <li>I just have to remember to use it every day :)</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>It should not cost more than $15.00</li>
      <li>I have tried so many eye gels, with no avail, without paying so much for the&lt;br /&gt;well known brands, this is good and adorable....</li>
      <li>It worked fine, however, the crows feet were still there.</li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t say that there&#x27;s a huge difference</li>
      <li>I found this product locally and it works great.</li>
      <li>The PLUS is it&#x27;s a cheap fix.  </li>
      <li>This product, however, is great, especially for the cost.  </li>
      <li>I had tried every other product it seemed, including the $50 ones, and this is the best by far.</li>
      <li>Good for young or old</li>
      <li>Even seems fine for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It did sting the first time I used it, for about 5 seconds, but never again after the first use.  </li>
      <li>Love this product and it&#x27;s such a bargain too.....</li>
      <li>I really like this eye gel!  </li>
      <li>Further, it is natural and good for my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I was really looking forward to this product.</li>
      <li>and I even had too much on my eyes once from the dermatologists creme (10 years ago) and</li>
      <li>It ended up looking very wrinkly once it took the puffiness out.  </li>
      <li>, also the cap causes too much to come out at</li>
      <li>It is not too rich and just enough for moisturize my skin.  </li>
      <li>I love the slight tingle when I apply it.  </li>
      <li>Not only does it soothes your eyes, it eases the lines tremendously.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;ve smoothed out a little more.</li>
      <li>This is my new &#x27;go to&#x27; product for eye creams.  </li>
      <li>I seriously see a difference &amp; honestly, it shocks me.</li>
      <li>once so be careful when you push the pump you dont want to waste too much as I have too many times because of the pump!</li>
      <li>I thought it would help with dark circles which was my primary reason, it did not.</li>
      <li>I order direct from the company and always look fordeals</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I just hit my 40s and now I have the eyes of a 60-70 year old.  </li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, and</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s right in the eyelid crease and shows as a dark line.  </li>
      <li>I can put other cream on, and gently flake the dry/dead skin off, but</li>
      <li>Over time I found that a little avocado oil under my eyes was the only thing that really made a difference</li>
      <li>I use a retinal product every other night, otherwise my skin gets too  dry &amp; sheds too much.  </li>

<li> First let me say that I am ALWAYS looking for the holy grail of under eye creams and have spent over $100 for a little jar of supposed miracle cream.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have dark circles, just regular crows feet &amp; horizontal lines due to my large cheek muscles.</li>
<li> a tiny bit goes a long way.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using it at night only for a little over a month, and I swear I look 5 years younger than I did before I started using it.</li>
<li> It left a crease in one of my eyelids that alternately oozes and shows flaky, dry skin.  </li>
<li> The only minus is that it does have a slight tingly burn while its drying</li>
<li> I bought this gel from tjmax for 3.99 after I spent hundreds on products that never did anything.</li>
<li> Just a little bit goes a long way.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> I just don&#x27;t know, maybe it works for other people.</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t tried other products like it though</li>
<li> I&#x27;m 31 and have started getting lines around my eyes, and I have found other products to be ineffective at alleviating this issue.  </li>
<li> I also have sensitive skin and have broken out from using other eye creams.  </li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t think much would come of this product, but boy was I wrong.</li>
<li> If you want to decrease puffiness and dark circles</li>
<li> If you are putting a moisturizer on after and still experiencing dryness, then cut down the days you use it.</li>
<li> After three days it started to burn slightly</li>
<li> I used this product for less than a week.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have dark circles but a little puffiness under the eyes.</li>
<li> I have seen my  dark eye circles lighten in just a few week.</li>
<li> the eye gel below my brows to where the crows feet appeared and little below my eye.  </li>
<li> I also feel like the packaging and description is a little misleading.</li>
<li> &amp; I&#x27;m assuming it was from just heavily moisturizing the area that makes it work.</li>
<li> The bottle was broken when it arrived.</li>
<li> Nevertheless, I did see and feel the difference for which I give 3 stars, but since the burning continues to get worse, I have to stop using it.</li>
<li> It seems to firm up the skin maybe since it&#x27;s a gel base.  </li>
<li> This product feels cooling under the eyes, but after a few seconds it burns horribly!</li>
<li> it drys my skin time every time i put it on  bad</li>
<li> stopped using it over three weeks ago, but the oozing, flaking, ugly line is still there.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for couple of months and I can&#x27;t say that there&#x27;s a huge difference, I do not notice anything different. Would not buy this again. Burns my skin around the eyes.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think much would come of this product, but boy was I wrong. First let me say that I am ALWAYS looking for the holy grail of under eye creams and have spent over $100 for a little jar of supposed miracle cream.  I don&#x27;t have dark circles, just regular crows feet &amp; horizontal lines due to my large cheek muscles. Over time I found that a little avocado oil under my eyes was the only thing that really made a difference &amp; I&#x27;m assuming it was from just heavily moisturizing the area that makes it work. The PLUS is it&#x27;s a cheap fix.  But of course I&#x27;m always still on the look out. I found the 40 carrots eye gel at TjMaxx and since it was like $6 I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  It did sting the first time I used it, for about 5 seconds, but never again after the first use.  Ok here&#x27;s the trick ladies.. if it feels drying or if it&#x27;s drying your skin out, it&#x27;s because you are STILL supposed to put a moisturizer on top of it. Just like you would after putting on any serum product. If you are putting a moisturizer on after and still experiencing dryness, then cut down the days you use it. I use a retinal product every other night, otherwise my skin gets too  dry &amp; sheds too much.  Ok so what do I think of this product???? OMG I cant believe it works so well. I seriously see a difference &amp; honestly, it shocks me. A $6 bottle of serum.. who would have thought.  I&#x27;m going to buy up every bottle I find now. LOL</li>
    <li> The bottle was broken when it arrived. Nothing but glass in the box. I found this product locally and it works great.</li>
    <li> I learned about this product on line, but I do not see any difference with my skin. I&#x27;m on the fence about it. I just don&#x27;t know, maybe it works for other people. Luz    PS maybe I need to use longer.</li>
    <li> I love the way this product makes your eyes feel tightened as if you have a mask on just after you apply. I have seen my  dark eye circles lighten in just a few week. The only minus is that it does have a slight tingly burn while its drying but it goes away as soon as it dries, also the cap causes too much to come out at once so be careful when you push the pump you dont want to waste too much as I have too many times because of the pump! If you want to decrease puffiness and dark circles this is the product!</li>
    <li> I really like this eye gel!  I&#x27;m 31 and have started getting lines around my eyes, and I have found other products to be ineffective at alleviating this issue.

I&#x27;ve been using it at night only for a little over a month, and I swear I look 5 years younger than I did before I started using it.</li>
    <li> great stuff for puffy eyes</li>
    <li> This product is good.  It is not too rich and just enough for moisturize my skin.  Further, it is natural and good for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Best eye gel I have ever used. Works great on puffiness. I have Graves&#x27; disease and my eyes use to be enlarged, causing fat pockets to form and always have puffiness under my eyes. This gel is the only thing that has worke in 10 years!</li>
    <li> this eye gel burns my skin not gonna use it anymore it drys my skin time every time i put it on  bad</li>
    <li> Love the value and love the product!</li>
    <li> 40 Carrots Eye Gel is a good product...I purchased it, not knowing if it was going&lt;br /&gt;to work. I have tried so many eye gels, with no avail, without paying so much for the&lt;br /&gt;well known brands, this is good and adorable....</li>
    <li> Love this product and it&#x27;s such a bargain too.....a tiny bit goes a long way.  Even got my mom hooked on it too.  It seems to firm up the skin maybe since it&#x27;s a gel base.  Even seems fine for sensitive skin. VERY happy with this and will buy again!  Good for young or old and we all like the good ingredients.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this eye gel because it is a great vitamin C product. It works well and refines the skin around my eyes.</li>
    <li> This is my new &#x27;go to&#x27; product for eye creams.  I love the slight tingle when I apply it.  I use it morning and night, it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and the bottle size is perfect for travel.</li>
    <li> This is a good product for the price. It does tighten around the eyes, temporarily. Not a treatment product though.</li>
    <li> It ended up looking very wrinkly once it took the puffiness out.  i stopped using it. I thought it would help with dark circles which was my primary reason, it did not.</li>
    <li> I bought this gel from tjmax for 3.99 after I spent hundreds on products that never did anything. I don&#x27;t have dark circles but a little puffiness under the eyes. Seeing that it has carrots and cucumber, I had to try. First three times, it felt great, and I could feel it tightening my skin. After three days it started to burn slightly and I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, and I thought maybe it means it is working, then the three days after, it continued to burn more and more that I couldn&#x27;t touch the skin around my eyes even when the product isn&#x27;t there any longer. Nevertheless, I did see and feel the difference for which I give 3 stars, but since the burning continues to get worse, I have to stop using it.</li>
    <li> I have been using all of the 40 Carrots for a while now they are excellent.  I order direct from the company and always look fordeals It should not cost more than $15.00</li>
    <li> I love this product - it feels so good on my face.  I just have to remember to use it every day :)</li>
    <li> This product feels cooling under the eyes, but after a few seconds it burns horribly! I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and I have normal/oily skin, not acne prone. I was really looking forward to this product.</li>
    <li> I had been using another brand eye gel. It worked fine, however, the crows feet were still there. I found 40 Carrots Eye Gel on the amazon website. I bought it, and now I can see an improvement where by crows feet use to be. They&#x27;ve smoothed out a little more. Just a little bit goes a long way. I use it in the morning and before I go to sleep at night. I tap on (not stretch) the eye gel below my brows to where the crows feet appeared and little below my eye.  I am very pleased with this product. I gave it 4 stars as there is no miracle that comes in a jar or gel.</li>
    <li> Within 3 days, the under area of my eyes were burned and now I have massive wrinkles.  I just hit my 40s and now I have the eyes of a 60-70 year old.  Don&#x27;t know what to do and plastic surgery can&#x27;t fix this.  I curse this product to the nth degree.  Someone had to test this somehow???  I even tried to make sure it was just the product and nothing else that I used...put it on just my forehead... burned burned burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have used retinol, acidic and chemical peels before and I even had too much on my eyes once from the dermatologists creme (10 years ago) and my eyes weren&#x27;t burnt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Run from this product!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product. A little goes a long way. Great for Under eyes. Reduces bags puffiness and lines. I use it in the morning and apply my make-up about an hour later.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple years.  I am 56 and it firms around eyes and helps with puffiness from allergies.</li>
    <li> aside from the mango lotion. I also feel like the packaging and description is a little misleading. The ingredients aren&#x27;t very healthy for your skin, lot&#x27;s of chemicals.</li>
    <li> this product burned my eyes probably because of allergies so may not be the products fault.  so i did not continue to use it.  but i love the rest of this line of 40 carrots including the shampoo</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit drying but it seems to take away some of the puffiness around my eyes. I haven&#x27;t tried other products like it though so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.</li>
    <li> I used this product for less than a week.  It left a crease in one of my eyelids that alternately oozes and shows flaky, dry skin.  It&#x27;s right in the eyelid crease and shows as a dark line.  I look like someone cut me.  IN THE EYE.  I can put other cream on, and gently flake the dry/dead skin off, but it always returns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using it over three weeks ago, but the oozing, flaking, ugly line is still there.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year now &amp; can only find it at tj maxx stores or amazon. It is an amazing price &amp; works miracles. I had tried every other product it seemed, including the $50 ones, and this is the best by far. Not only does it soothes your eyes, it eases the lines tremendously.</li>
