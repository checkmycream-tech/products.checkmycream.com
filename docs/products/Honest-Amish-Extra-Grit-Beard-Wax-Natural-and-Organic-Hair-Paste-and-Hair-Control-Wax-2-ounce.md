      <li>Now I wish I would have gotten the regualr non-grit kind...</li>

      <li>Take a nickle-size amount of the beard-wax and rub between hands to warm.</li>
      <li>Kind of spicy.</li>

      <li>The odor is far from pleasing but it works great!</li>

      <li>Honest Amish products are great, I don&#x27;t really care about chemicals or anything like that, but the products do what they say.</li>
      <li>I done plan on testing products any further as I think I&#x27;ve found the best with Honest Amish.</li>

      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>I would, I have tried many beard products and this surpasses all of them.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Second, I thought it would have more holding power.  </li>
      <li>Hold is OK.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Was excited to finally get to use it, after a long time of contemplating the purchase. Unfortunately though, my dog decided to eat it first. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> People that dont care or even like my beard have been giving it the praisd it demands. The honest amish products do every thing right. Thanks.</li>
    <li> This grit with the original beard wax is all I need forever. The company has never messed up my order and I order quite frequently. They are amazing. The grit works wonders on stray hairs and the original wax (of the same company) to give the illusion of a thicker beard. Only use the original wax throughout the whole beard and then the grit on the ends to control the strays. I won&#x27;t use another product. I even enjoy the scent.</li>
    <li> The product has a pleasant smell.  It is a bit stiff and needs to be worked before use.</li>
    <li> I have a very stubborn beard, and this is one of the first products that can hold it in place. Highly recommend. Fyi though it does have a strong licorice sent incase you&#x27;re not in to that.</li>
    <li> Grit stuff is annoying.</li>
    <li> Pros: 1) Personally, I like the smell of the Extra Grit. 2) The wax it self takes some work to soften up, but it spreads easily if heated up a little with a hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: 1) Poor hold. My beard isn&#x27;t super long (a few inches at its longest), an no matter how much of this stuff I use, never seems to be tame. I&#x27;ve tried dry hair, wet hair, towel dry, blow dried, etc. Still no difference. Tried a nickel size of the wax, all the way up to a good scoop. 2) It leaves flakes after it&#x27;s dried, making it look like I have beard dandruff 2) The wax rubs off on my shirt collar, making it look like I haven&#x27;t washed in&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I ordered 2 cans, and now I&#x27;m stuck with a full one. Maybe it&#x27;s because of my hair or the product itself, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> After purchasing the honest Amish heavy duty beard balm I was wanting to try a wax. The balm was good product but was not really what I was looking for. This wax is excellent for beards, it has just the right amount of hold and keeps my beard looking fresh. I will be buying this product again. On another note honest Amish has outstanding customer service!</li>
    <li> This stuff is hard-core.&lt;br /&gt;It definitely has the hold that I&#x27;m looking for in my beard, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s *perfect.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a while to pick out and warm up enough to be able to rub it into the beard without getting some clumps of dark stuff on there, so be sure to work it in properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of weeks of using it in conjunction with another lighter beard cream, I hit the jackpot by mixing the two together in my hands at the same time. The cream broke down the wax, which mixed with the cream and it was way easier to apply to the beard. Once that concoction dried up, my beard was in control, looking and feeling great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still highly recommend this product, but in my personal experience, it works best when combined with some other element that breaks it down a little before applying.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. Holds better than oils or balms and has a good smell. Great for keeping those wild hairs from sprouting out</li>
    <li> Good product. I have an exceptionally wavy beard and the held fairly well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for that &#x27;never-need-another-product&#x27; kind of a product, and this is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does this wax tame the beard come morning, but, its an even better hair wax!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a shallow fade with a top length of 5 inches, wavy, and coarse. Extra Grit holds my hair back for the entire day, but stays very malleable; not grease feeling hands, and the finish on my hair is NOT shiny, its a awesome matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honest Amish made a lifetime consumer.</li>
    <li> I have tried other balms and wax options on my beard but this is easily the best for control. I rub some on my hands till the wax is clear and smooth it over my damp beard after a shower, the hold is fantastic once it is dried even hours later. So even if I put it on in the morning at night using a brush it can be styled but crucially it is not sticky or wet feeling. By the way the grit just disappears into the beard, i have never seen any come off onto my hands or clothes. Will buy this all the time now.</li>
    <li> Great product that works well with no aroma. It conditions nicely and isn&#x27;t sticky. My husbands beard is manageable and soft. He&#x27;s loyal to this brand.</li>
    <li> I have a very thick red beard and needs taming. It also gives my beard a deeper, darker appearance than a shiny red. This product is my go to and I and would highly recommend for beards that need to be groomed.</li>
    <li> I use this when  i need  alot of hold or control  of my beard. Like it says,  it&#x27;s  gritty.</li>
    <li> Love it. Smells great. I keep a 1-2 am short beard. This stuff make it look thick and it controls any weird areas.</li>
    <li> I reluctantly ordered this version of the beard wax because I wanted to have a bit more control that it appeared was provided by the original beard wax as per the reviews. It is a bit strange, there is a gritty consistency to it, as I&#x27;m sure you could deduce from the product name. It can end up putting some little black dots on your hands when you stroke your beard (admit it, you do it to) but it doesn&#x27;t do it as bad the longer the wax is in. My young son sometimes gets the \\&quot;grit\\&quot; on his hands or face, but it just brushes right off... and it&#x27;s made of all organic materials so I don&#x27;t really worry that much anywho.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I for one, think the smell is amazing, and so does my wife (think licorice, anise, and the sweetness of beeswax it&#x27;s woodsy and manly as bearskin boxers) It gives my beard shape,keeps it all together, and has softened it over time. It takes a pretty special product to keep a man and his beard together through sweltering southwest summers... and this wax did the trick. I just drag my fingernail through it until it&#x27;s covered by about 1/4\\&quot; of wax, distribute that chunk over my first three fingertips, rub my fingers together keeping the wax rather consolidated on the tips of my fingers until it melts and stroke it in from chops to chin. It&#x27;s easy, and it does wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the product itself doesn&#x27;t roll your socks, the customer service from these guys will. If you&#x27;re on the fence, just get some, they&#x27;ll take care of you either way.</li>
    <li> If I could give this product 10 stars I would, I have tried many beard products and this surpasses all of them. It&#x27;s not supper stiff to the point that your beard does not feel like you put concrete on it. The best thing about the product is the volume it adds. I have a few thinner than I would like area this product works magic in these areas.</li>
    <li> It works great, keeps my beard in tact.</li>
    <li> I would not have purchased if the description told me this would smell overpoweringly of black liquorice. I just received my wax today and went to try some out and gagged at the smell! Smelled like i was rubbing mashed up black jelly beans into my glorious beard.  The tin went immediately into the trash can. No thanks! Too stinky for me.</li>
    <li> Let me preface this with my love Honest Amish beard balm, which I use a couple times a week. My beard is getting longer now and I&#x27;m getting quite a few curly hairs in my already wavy beard. Hoping this stuff would help tame them I placed an order for the extra grit beard wax.  However after a couple weeks of using it, my hopes of this solving my issues has faded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the smell is strong, others explain it like black licorice, I just call it a strong &#x27;herbal&#x27; smell.  It can be overpowering if used close to your nose. However it does fade away after a couple hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, I thought it would have more holding power.  Going with the extra grit, I expected it to hold some of these strays in place. It doesn&#x27;t seem to do much of that. It oils the beard up real well, but doesn&#x27;t really do any extra holding/sculpting.  I&#x27;m afraid to use too much and have the smell be too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not disappointed with the company, I&#x27;ll try their other products, but my expectations from other reviews for this product were far from met.</li>
    <li> No matter how much you rub it some small gray particles are visible in the beard, and because of the color black it stains the neck of light color shirts and ties.</li>
    <li> I have a fairly long beard and this stuff does a great job of wrangling the beard when the regular wax isn&#x27;t quite enough.</li>
    <li> Having tried their original beard balm (which I love), I expected something with more moisturizer. It&#x27;s like putting actual grit in your beard, so if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re after this fits the bill.</li>
    <li> Ive used this product several times, and it works well. My beard is pretty wiry and it helps hold things in place. It is not the most firm hold by any means but it foes the trick.</li>
    <li> Smells awkward at best. It clumps and makes your beard greasy and application is not the easiest. Just didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
    <li> Great product! Keeps my beard in place, smells good. Will continue to buy this.</li>
    <li> Awesome. I love smell and works well</li>
    <li> At first you think 25 dollars is kind of high. But the soft lavender smell is not overwhelming. You also don&#x27;t need a whole lot. About a dime size is more than enough. Makes my face feel cleaner and softer. I don&#x27;t get razor burns or bumps and I get a really close shave. This should last you several months. The Art of Shaving products are not cheap. But as far as quality you are getting a great deal. The quantity also works itself out in the end. I was paying around 6 or 7 dollars for good shaving creams in a can. This usually lasts around 6 months and that&#x27;s with shaving 3 to 4 times a week. I will definitely be buying this for now on. Excellent product and we&#x27;ll worth the money!</li>
    <li> the licorice aroma is subtle but noticeable and i love it!  my girlfriend can&#x27;t get enough of my beard smelling like this and looking so glossy and soft.  the grit is very helpful but in a way that wasn&#x27;t intended by the manufacturer.  I have a bad habit of pulling out beard hairs with split ends.  instead of pulling out hairs and thinning my marvelous face bear, i&#x27;m picking out pieces of grit.  It satisfies my habit whilst protecting the vast and wonderful landscape that is my ladykiller.  thanks honest amish!</li>
    <li> Great product, use it on beard or hair!</li>
    <li> Did not work very well for me</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re going to use this product, make sure you (and everyone around you) loves licorice.  The smell is extremely potent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased this item if this was in the description; instead, the product claims &amp;#34;a nice spiced scent from the natural essential oils within&amp;#34; which isn&#x27;t technically wrong... it&#x27;s just misleading.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best beard balm/wax I have ever found. Feels terrific and the smell is great. Kind of spicy. Paired with Honest Amish&#x27;s Patchouli soap I get the same comment fairly frequently from women: &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t take this the wrong way, but you smell incredible.&amp;#34; My wife agrees. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never switch soaps or beard wax/conditioner as long as HA is around.</li>
    <li> Great products and customer service!</li>
    <li> Love it! Great scent, lovely texture and general feel. Beard looks great, specially when used with Heavy Duty Beard Balm.</li>
    <li> gave it to a buddy as a gift, he loves it and has bought another one since then. was a great gift to a bearded man.</li>
    <li> I like this wax, it holds my beard on place! love the pepperlike-herbal smell !!!&lt;br /&gt;Better if used with the honest amish beard balm :)</li>
    <li> A co-worker recommended both this and the beard balm to me. I love the wax and used it primarily on my mustache to &#x27;shape&#x27; it&#x27;s growth outward instead of downward. It worked like a charm. I only regret leaving this out in a sunny area and ruining the wax.</li>
    <li> Previously, I was an Honest Amish Original Beard Wax user. I didn&#x27;t think I would ever use anything else. One day, while getting ready to order another can of the Original, this Extra Grit product caught my attention. What do I do? Would I like the Extra Grit product better? How will I ever know? So I ordered a can of both and I can honestly say that both products are equally great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give Extra Grit a try because I liked the sound of it, and I was curious if it would effect my manly neck curtain differently. The biggest difference between this and the Original is the grit, obviously. The hold seems to be about the same. I&#x27;m not sure what exactly the grit does, but I like it. There is something about rubbing small grit particles into my Lumberjack badge that makes me want to go out and chop down a tree. I somehow feel manlier with those little dirt chunks in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once applied, the grit seems to disappear. I don&#x27;t know where it goes, but I think my beard absorbs the grit and it gives my hanging garden super powers. It goes in easy and the aroma is the slightly distant scent of black licorice. It&#x27;s good stuff. Oh, and my wife has had no complaints about these products. Scents, textures, looks, the ladies give it two thumbs up. (My lady does, and I&#x27;m assuming others would feel the same because she is classy.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honest Amish products help me look like my beard is on purpose, and give me confidence. I have never received so much respect from complete strangers until I started using it. Get yourself a can and you can be respected too.</li>
    <li> Smells fantastic. Manly scent that is just strong enough but not overpowering. This product has great hold. A little goes a very long way. I also use Honest Amish heavy duty beard balm. I have fallen in love with both products. I highly recommend to any man that is serious about having a healthy and great looking beard!</li>
    <li> Tried this despite thinking it would color a completely white thick beard - and it did noticeably.  Aside from that age-related issue, the texture, hold and smell are good.</li>
    <li> I think this may be the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used.  I prefer their normal wax for my beard, but had I not used the original formula, I would give this a great review.  I done plan on testing products any further as I think I&#x27;ve found the best with Honest Amish.</li>
    <li> Honest Amish knocks it out of the park once again with this beard wax. I love everything about it. If you need a well tamed beard with good control  this your product.</li>
    <li> I like it. Doesn&#x27;t really have a smell,but like the way it controls my beard.  Wish it was a little easier to get out of can and on beard.</li>
    <li> The hold is awesome. But the smell is weird and strong, and it stains even after a while!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It controls my unruly beard and has hint of color to help cover the grey.</li>
    <li> The transaction went well...but he said the smell was too strong and it didn&#x27;t hold his beard in place.:(</li>
    <li> Not a huge fan of the black licorice scent (it&#x27;s actually anise, which smells similar), but it fades sorta quick, and you&#x27;re left with a sweet and spicy scent. The wax goes on easy and holds very well, though I&#x27;m still training my stache, so I have to reapply at least once after the morning application.&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea what the grit is actually for, and it does get all over your fingers every time you touch your stache/beard for the rest of the day. I might go with the regular one next time, since otherwise I&#x27;m pretty satisfied. As far as I can tell, the dark wax and the tiny black specks of grit aren&#x27;t noticeable while *in* the hair, and they don&#x27;t darken my reddish beard at all.</li>
    <li> smells good, has little grit, cost to much,doesn&#x27;t hold that good, comes in pretty can. WOULDN&#x27;T BUY ANYMORE,dadadadadadadadats all folks</li>
    <li> Works great to keep everything in line. Doesn&#x27;t smell as great as the honey colored one, but does the job just fine.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. The general appearance of my beard looks amazing, no more stray hairs sticking out. Very manageable and smells great. Will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> I like this a little better then beard oil. It tames your beard and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling too sticky or oily. The smell is the only negative about this, it&#x27;s not too bad but I sometimes feel self conscious about it. A different smell would be nice, maybe lavender, or anything more pleasant. My beard is awesome now make it smell awesome too.. Overall a good product.</li>
    <li> This is a very unique product. I have tried many different products from many different companies, and I can say that Honest Amish is top notch. I have tried all their waxes, balms, and even their soaps. They are all great, but this product is best for my beard. This stuff adds VOLUME to my beard. It has a medium pliable hold, it is not a stiff wax. It also conditons at the same time, although I do use the Honest Amish balm first before putting this on. I have found if I need more hold, I can add a small amount of a stiff wax (usually a mustache wax) and combine with the Xtra Grit beard wax. The main thing that this stuff does that makes it so unique is the volumizing. I mean it can take a small flat beard and turn it into a fluffy bush. I like the natural beard look, so this gives me some hold but also also the natural shape of my beard to shine through. after i put this in my beard, I rub the residual into my hair and they are right when they say it makes a great hair product. Also creates a nice uniformity from my hair to my beard.</li>
    <li> Full beards be prepared to be tamed. A waxy, gritty beard balm with the perseverance of an Appalachian monk and the strength of a prize fighter. P.S. looks like sandy boogers or a small dogs poop, don&#x27;t be alarmed, it&#x27;s not. I checked.</li>
    <li> Not as practical as the original beard wax leaves a slight discoloration on lighter beards. IT is not as easy to apply but does work.</li>
    <li> The product itself seems to work okay. I&#x27;m still figure out how much to actually use and the best way to apply it. It has a pleasant, light scent.&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint is the burlap bag packaging the tin came in is somewhat superfluous and silly.</li>
    <li> It is definitely a strong wax. I&#x27;m not sure that the grit is for everybody. You really do feel it. The smell is like the other beard wax, but a bit stronger. There are stronger, tackier waxes out there. This one is a nice balance.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with all of the products that I have gotten from Honest Amish.  I got this product not understanding the properties of beard waxes.  I assumed that the grit made it heavy duty, but in fact it is more of a medium hold. This works perfect for a relaxed look to my beard and moustache for the days I do not want heavy styling.  The hold is perfect and keeps wild hairs tamed and holds the beard shape all day long.  I also love the subtle manly scent.  Honest Amish provides great waxes and balms and they are part of my everyday beard grooming arsenal.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great, smells great too 👍👍</li>
    <li> Bought this for my beard and it worked so well I started using it on my hair as well. Be warned, a little goes a long way. But this stuff is really excellent. It is really great on my my beard and as I allow my beard to get longer it keeps it neat without feeling heavy at all. In fact, once brushed through my beard, it just holds everything in place but the product itself just seems to disappear and my beard remains soft to the touch. Ditto for my experience using it on my hair. Just don&#x27;t use too much of it. But if you have hard to manage hair or want to keep your beard longer but neat this is a great product.</li>
    <li> The extra grit works great on a thinner beard. I do not notice any smell. Company is also awesome at feedback and taking care of any tiny issue. I have tried other products, this works best for me.</li>
    <li> This wax works well to shape my beard. It will not act like a gel, fyi. A little dab is enough to keep those stray follicles in place.</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery and exactly as the the description said!</li>
    <li> I like this product because it is stiff, but not so stiff it feels like crayon on my face.  Easy to apply with a good smell.</li>
    <li> Great product, I like that its not &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; like other waxes and leave my beard soft and conditioned.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it daily for about a month. Overall, wax provides good hold through out the day. Fits perfect in pocket for touch-ups. Wife says scent is perceived in close proximity, but it is a pleasant one. Greatest plus for me is that it adds volume to beard, particularly in those areas where facial hair growth is not as abundant, and it keeps it well tamed through out the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of dollars less would be better, when you add shipping the cost increases and the price is high for such a small amount. Perhaps they should not send you the small bag that comes with it to cut down on their costs, thereby make it more appealing to the pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, good product, does what it says it will do; I am ordering a couple more for me, and I have recommended it to family and friends. Lastly, it&#x27;s kind of cool to get attention from folks when they see the Honest Amish label!</li>
    <li> Let me be clear and let you know that I really like honest amish&#x27;s beard balm.  I use the beard balm every single day and it does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beard is getting quite a bit longer now so I decided that I should get a wax as well.  However, I was very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;(1) The wax is very hard and so you really have to work to get it out of the can.&lt;br /&gt;(2) I had to use a lot of wax to make any kind of difference in my beard.  I bought it for pesky hairs that curl around my sideburns and this did nothing to help me.  I bought the extra grit specifically because it was supposed to be strong enough to help.&lt;br /&gt;(3) Lastly, I do not like the smell at all.  The beard balm has a nice natural smell but the smell of this wax is very peppery and unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy their beard balm but I was very let down by this wax.</li>
    <li> Smells peppery and when used liberally creates a stiff hold without gloss. Can even hold after light conditioning.  The tin is smaller then it appears but lasts. For an inch of growth off your chin: wet beard, use a thick, quarter to a half dollar sized, smear and rub between hands and run through beard. Use on mustaches for a nice hold without clumping. Not a perfect mustache wax but better then most. Will purchase again. Best on the market.</li>
    <li> I have a fairly soft and curly beard, 5&amp;#34; of length and aside from trimming at the neckline, cheeks and mustache, it grows without restriction. It&#x27;s fluffy and I like it a little more compact, so balm works well, but this Extra Grit wax/paste is AMAZING. I can go a whole day with my beard feeling heavier and less poofy. It smells great to me and a little goes a long way. I suck at reviews, try it and enjoy.</li>
    <li> Extra control and nice sent..</li>
    <li> I like the product. It smells nice but I wish it held a little bit better especially for being Extra Grit Beard Wax.  But still good product.</li>
    <li> Awesome product thank you I have some course hair and it tames it blow dry then set it where you want it stay all day.</li>
    <li> I previously had been using the Honest Amish Slick Beard Wax and loved it. My beard was getting longer and thicker so I thought I would up the ante by using the extra grit portion once my last tin was empty. For me it was a mistake, but that is not to say the product did not do as intended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax itself was felt stiffer and grittier than the original, went in the beard nice and it did keep a stiff hold on my beard through out the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I had as a product was that the grit stayed around all day and I could feel it in my beard. If I touched my beard I would have black specks all over my fingers. The wife didn&#x27;t like having to wash her face after kissing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other downside for me was the scent. I personally don&#x27;t mind the black liquorice smell, but smelling it all day was a bit much. The wife also hated the way it made my beard smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tin for me has gone to waste as I will probably just go back to the Slick Beard Wax but have to use a bit more of it to hold my beards form through out the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honest Amish still makes a great product and ships quickly.</li>
    <li> Smells good and gives nice hold!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure about this product when I first saw it. However after persevering with it for a week or two I have found myself reaching for this over the more &amp;#34;Tacky&amp;#34; versions more and more. The grit does put you off at first but I found I got used to it fairly quickly. I will order this again.</li>
    <li> Keep it in room temperature!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was my only mistake, but aside from that it works great.</li>
    <li> could be a little smoother</li>
    <li> Good hold, nauseatingly strong smell!</li>
    <li> Excellent product for those of us with extra curly beards!!  Great control and hold.</li>
    <li> Great for beard control!</li>
    <li> After having a med. beard for a number of years an dealing with the frizzy ,fuzzy look I found Honest Amish Extra Grit Breard Wax a got the streight smooth hold look I had been seeking for a long time an let my beard grow out more you know really get some lenght to it now that i have control of it. Guy you have to buy this product its what you need to take control of your face.</li>
    <li> I love this wax...but i can&#x27;t use it because it irritates my skin an causes bumps.</li>
    <li> Just strange really. Bits of dirt and smell not great.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have used this product. It is amazing. I found a product that I will use forever two thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Great product,My Beard is very frizzy, keeps it in place</li>
    <li> I have used the Honest Amish beard balm, slick beard wax, original beard wax and extra grit for about a half a year now. My beard is maybe about one inch to an inch and a half long and pretty curly. Honest Amish products are great, I don&#x27;t really care about chemicals or anything like that, but the products do what they say. The scent on all but the extra grit are great, the extra grit doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but like other reviews have said, licorice scent, which I&#x27;m not too much of a fan of, but all the other products have a great scent. They do a great job at keeping the fly aways down and the beard sculpted. I haven&#x27;t had a problem with black flecks on my hands when I rub my beard with my hand, so I don&#x27;t know what that other dude was doing. It also doesn&#x27;t add much volume to my beard, but it&#x27;s already pretty full so I don&#x27;t need it. If you&#x27;re looking for something to keep the beard sculpted and the fly aways down, I&#x27;d go with the slick beard wax or original beard wax, unless you like the smell of licorice or your significant other does, then get this one</li>
    <li> Good pruduct for bringing control tour beard, especially for work.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I really like the smell and feel of the product. The hold is not as firm as I would like it though.</li>
    <li> It does a decent job but I can&#x27;t even use it anymore because the smell is so strong my girlfriend hates it. They should mention in the title or description that it smells heavily of spicy licorice. Now I wish I would have gotten the regualr non-grit kind...</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in this stuff, which I bought based upon positive reviews.  Perhaps it works differently for different beard types.  Mine is curly and unruly, and when using this wax, my beard became even more curly and unruly, which was not what I wanted.  Perhaps it works better on straight hair.  I also did not care for the smell, which was unpleasant, and the texture, which was weird.  Wax is a good name for it.  You have to scrape it up with your fingernail and really really work it to get it into your beard.  It&#x27;s a lot of work for such minimal results.  I&#x27;m afraid this goes on the back shelf with my growing collection of beard waxes that do not work, of which there are many.  I do have to say, however, that the company was more than willing to give me a refund.  I was too lazy to repackage it and send it back, but I did want to note their willingness to make it right.</li>
    <li> I bought this expecting plenty of hold. But when they say grit, they mean grit.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s basically clay/sand in the wax. it really doesn&#x27;t provide much extra hold because&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s like wet sand and crumbles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s all natural, but with the shipping and the price it isn&#x27;t worth it if you want actual hold.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s kind of gross unless you have a really big bushy long beard. like the guy on the tin. any shorter and you&#x27;re left with a greasy smelly beard. this does not tame any loose hairs whatsoever.</li>
    <li> The liquorice amen is mild. Hold is OK. Need to practice more with it tho.</li>
    <li> Good product lovely scent. Does have a tendency to clump if too much is applied. Scent reminds me of licorice.</li>
    <li> Nice wax, it hold my wild beard in place without being stiff. I will be ordering more of this product. I use it about four to five times a week. The other three or two days a week I use the Honest Amish heavy balm conditioner. The color is dark and I have a light blond greying beard but once you rub it on your palms of your hands and finger it in to your beard the dark color is gone so no worries about that. I really cant feel the grit it this wax except when I&#x27;m rubbing it on my palms. This is my first beard wax and I like it, as a added bonus my wife loves the smell and yes there is a smell but we enjoy it.</li>
    <li> Honest Amish Extra Grit is a must-have for my beard! The price is nice and it always arrives quickly. I&#x27;ll never use another beard product.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff!  Smells great and holds it in place.</li>
    <li> Really enjoy this product. First, the smell is very herbal, some pepper and anise, and everyone who has been close enough to smell my beard has commented on how good it smells. So that&#x27;s a plus. Second, it&#x27;s all natural so I really don&#x27;t mind smearing it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beard is currently 1.5 to 2 inches and ranges from curly to wavy. This product tends to help straighten and hold my beard all day. It also makes it a bit thicker which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I manage my beard:&lt;br /&gt;1. Condition every other day, no soap, shampoo. Can use an apple cider vinegar rinse if the product buildup gets too much, but this isn&#x27;t common. Soap and shampoo will just make your beard more frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;2. While beard is still wet, use a small amount of defrizzer. I like: [[ASIN:B000P9DS4Q John Frieda Frizz-Ease Extra Strength Serum, 1.69 Ounces]]&lt;br /&gt;3. Every other day or so, I use a heat-protector. Something like this: [[ASIN:B000H88QOM TRESemme Thermal Creations Heat Tamer Protective Spray 8 fl oz (236 ml)]]. Then blow-dry on low heat, and comb out. This will straighten the beard even more.&lt;br /&gt;4. Take a nickle-size amount of the beard-wax and rub between hands to warm. rub over the top of your beard. Just rub downward, following the hair growth. Rub your finger over the wax in the container and apply to mustache area. Comb through beard and stache.&lt;br /&gt;5. Finally, apply one more nickle sized amount whenever you need to touch up. Don&#x27;t comb through, just apply over the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that&#x27;s about 10 minutes worth of work in the morning, but it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
    <li> Great product! These guys know what they&#x27;re talking about and they back it up with an excellent product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty great for being chemical free. It&#x27;s not greasy and rubs in easily.The smell is like a peppery mild black licorice and not overpowering at all. It tames my mustache pretty well and is a great substitute for hair gel. These guys nailed it with this product and I&#x27;ll definitely be doing business with them again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the first beard wax i&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s alright if you like the black liquorice smell, which i do, but not all day. The thing i do not like is that there are little black flakes that are in the wax. I find that throughout the day I&#x27;ll brush my beard with my hand and will then later on realize that there are tiny black spots on my hand.</li>
    <li> Love the product, hate the tin. Unlike other Honest Amish products the tin top doesn&#x27;t have any grip to it. It&#x27;s near impossible to remove the top. Very frustrating every day!</li>
    <li> Just as a reminder, three stars equals &amp;#34;it&#x27;s okay.&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t hate it, I don&#x27;t love it. I just think it&#x27;s okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good (for me): As a man with a well sized beard that is often times frizzy I&#x27;m constantly needing to have better control of it for the professional world. While some waxes and oils work okay, they&#x27;re simply not enough and will only hold a few hairs down which always end with the hair getting even frizzier as the day goes on. This wax does a very good job (so far) in keeping my beard manageable and tame. I&#x27;m still getting used to using it and the results are getting better, I&#x27;m sure using just a bit more with each use could have my beard perfectly shaped and have it reach my desired result. Which kind of leads to my only problem with the wax....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell. I cannot stand the smell. I know it&#x27;s all subjective, but if you don&#x27;t like the smell of licorice/anise then this is not for you. It&#x27;s true the smell does fade after time, but the lingering of it is even more annoying to me than the initial smell when I apply it. So, I cannot use any more than I already do because it would make the smell last longer. This especially a problem if you use scented beard oils or other products as they usually don&#x27;t mix well with the scent of this wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t complain about how the wax works, it does so seemingly perfectly. The smell, however, will keep me from using it again. I can only hope they  make an unscented version in the future.</li>
    <li> I shaved off my Goatee on an impulse before I got to use this product. I will be growing it back very soon haha, I did however use this product on my hair as the product description said that it could be used for that. it is better then any pomade or hair gel I have ever used in my life. My hair is very thick and very difficult to manage, this product was light and held my hair where I wanted it to be all day and even after I slept on it. It is light weight and not overly greasy like some pomades are. It was wonderful and I am extremely happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying a different beard/moustache wax.  Compared to what I used before, I absolutely love the texture and color, and softness of the wax.  It is easy to apply and makes the beard feel soft and smooth.  But I must say, the odor of the wax reminds me of anise (think black licorice).  Whether intentional or natural, this odor is very unpleasant to me, and I find it very noticeable with every breath I take for hours after application.  I much would prefer a totally neutral smell, or some hint of a more pleasant organic scent, if such a thing exists.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again unless I could be certain to get something that had a different fragrance. (or no fragrance).  If you happen to like that particular smell, then I think you&#x27;ll find the product great.</li>
    <li> This wax smells like mud and seaweed. The odor is far from pleasing but it works great!</li>
    <li> After first tin tried varity of balms and oils with different scents and holds. Returned to grit. This wax adds density and hold to my beard that others did not. I like the scent myself that I find herbal.</li>
    <li> Love HA products. Just what my beard needed.</li>
    <li> Stuff is amazing and smells like spicy licorice.</li>
    <li> I have about a year of growth and this product is the best at taming/shaping the beard. Very pleased. This is my 3rd can. A little goes a LONG way!</li>
    <li> Perfect addition to the beard balm I already use. Great hold, not too tight or waxy feeling like others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Easy application. It is gritty but not thick. I was hoping for a stronger hold over the regular beard wax. I do like the wax however I may not buy it again as I will go with regular wax. The smell is nice, I actually disagree with the licorice comments.</li>
    <li> One of the worst products I&#x27;ve ever purchased in my life in general. It changes your beard color. Has LESS than average hold and smells absolutely terrible. For something that&#x27;s apparently stringer it takes literally a handful to do anything. I had so much excitement for this product that I had it one day shipped. I&#x27;m do let down. But am too lazy to get a refund</li>
    <li> This may so weird, but I use this as hair gel. I have used America Crew Fiber for years, however, I have been searching for an all natural product as I tend to get itchy bumps (pimples?) on my scalp. So, I tried extra grit beard balm. I really like it. It has a great hold without being greasy or shiny. I don&#x27;t care too much for the licorice smell, but it only lasts about 15 minutes. I use about 1/2 of a pea amount and it holds all day. No more bumps on my scalp too.</li>
