<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I am a white momma with a 5 year old Ethiopian daughter. We have tried so many different products, and couldn&#x27;t find anything that worked for her hair. When she started kindergarten, we resorted to paying for braids to be done because I didn&#x27;t know what else to do.&lt;br /&gt;After doing braids for 7 months, we decided to take a break from braids, and the lady who braids her hair recommended Mixed Chicks Leave-In conditioner. In my opinion, it is a miracle. I just started using it this week, but we washed, conditioned, and combed on Saturday, put her hair in a ponytail, and each day have worked a quarter sized amount of Mixed Chicks into her hair with my fingers while still in the ponytail. Her curls are defined, soft, and beautiful. And her hair isn&#x27;t overly greasy or oily like many of the other products we&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome....I used to be a gel and mouse kind of girl....don&#x27;t get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with mouse and gel but once you use this product you will never go back to anything else.  Leaves hair soft and manageable...shiny....not frizzy...smells great...it feels like a very creamy gel...and it putss a bunch of moisture in your hair...Great Product!! If you have not tried it..you need to...you must!</li>
    <li> This is the PERFECT product for my very curly naturally frizzy hair. I have found nothing even mildly comparable. I love it.</li>
    <li> i love the product and would consider getting other products in their product line. Great product! it did exactly what it said it would.</li>
    <li> I really like this for my daughter who has wild hair. I think it should come in gallons. Because she uses so much of it.&lt;br /&gt;I would say any latin or dark skinned you will love this product.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a good leave in conditioner for a very long time, and feel like I finally found one.  I am mixed (Black/White) and have fairly dry hair.  In the past I have used leave in conditioners and then had to use a gel or mousse to keep my curls tamed. I was able to use this leave in with no other product, and it left my hair soft, tamed, and with a nice shine. Also I comb my hair in the shower, and with many products after being in my hair for a day I have had great difficulty getting the comb through my hair the next morning (yes even with the water streaming down!) Mixed Chicks creates no tangles, and the comb easily goes through. It is heavy so if you&#x27;re used to light weight leave in&#x27;s be forwarned.  Definitely a great product for curly mixed girl hair.</li>
    <li> Fabulous! My adopted daughter is mixed with soft, abundant curls. This product is wonderful! Not too heavy, and not sticky or crunchy. It defines her curls and keeps frizz under control.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my 3 yrs old girl with really dry, curly, thin hair. Unfortunately, the product does not work so well on her. After a couple of hours her hair is very dry and looks frizzy. However, I tried the product on my hair (to see if it was the product or my girl&#x27;s hair) and it works great. I love how the product leaves my hair. I guess this is not the right product for my little girl&#x27;s hair type.</li>
    <li> My daughter is mixed black and white and has curly hair but it is not course.  Nothing worked.  Black products to oily and would cause reactions in her scalp.  Creamy black produts good but need additional stuff to work. She is 13 and did not believe this would work.  She put it in and an hour later it was still curly, not a frizzy ball.  She kept touching it, she could not believe it.  Can&#x27;t live without out it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The [...] website is very informative.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  My hair is a mixture of African and Caucasian, and this is one of the few products that manages my frizz!</li>
    <li> I have very thick and VERY curly hair. I was hoping to feel more of a difference when I used it for the first time.  My hair does feel softer, but not work the 20 bucks.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair curly and looking nice instead of dry and frizzy!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this hair product for anyone with curls!  This is the first product I have found that works well with my wavy/curls.  It keeps my hair soft, but keeps away frizz.  There is not any alcohol in this product so it will not dry out your hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this product along with the Mix Chick Silk Shine to manage my wet and wavy weave curls. Used together, they leave lasting, shiny and  manageable curls all day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m half black and half Japanese. My hair is very thick and very thirsty. I used to have it long growing up and would use a home relaxer a lot to try to get some control of the curls. I&#x27;d still just air-dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was 25, I let my hair grow out a few inches and then did a big chop to go back to my natural texture and I was happy to find that once I chopped off the old dead hair, I had lovely, springy curls. They are very thirsty though. If I do nothing after a shower, the curls wilt, become very dry, brittle and kinky.  I basically have a short, curly &#x27;fro. In the summer I go very close to my scalp closer to my neck, and in the winter I let it grow out a bit to the point where I part my hair and use bobby pins on each side to flatten the front \\&quot;bang\\&quot; parts, and let the rest of the curls puff out. My hair is so thick, and as long as I keep it moisturized, it stays shiny, moist and not so kinky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problem, like most, is having 5 different products to use. And usually one of the products would be to combat a side-effect of one of the other products. For example, for separation of curls, it was usually a curl-defining gel of some sort meant for \\&quot;white hair\\&quot;, which works but probably contained alcohol so I&#x27;d need a moisturizer because of the alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is basically everything. It moisturizes and defines my curls and is just thick enough to hold, provides shine and does not dry. But how well this product works is also dependent up on your routine and how you style your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hair about every week in the summer, and can go for 2 weeks in the winter. My curls are the best a few days after I&#x27;ve washed it when the product sinks in and my hair is weighed down a little bit more. So, I shampoo my hair/scalp with an organic daily shampoo. I don&#x27;t condition very often - only in the summer when my hair is the dryest. Here&#x27;s my strategy:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Wet hair&lt;br /&gt;- Shampoo gently&lt;br /&gt;- Use a very wide tooth comb to release tangles during rinse&lt;br /&gt;(after this I do NOT use anything but my fingers)&lt;br /&gt;- I pat VERY gently with towel and squeeze out what I can&lt;br /&gt;- apply Mixed Chicks, about a 50 cent piece worth to my hands and rub together&lt;br /&gt;- run the product through with my fingers from scalp to ends. I do this all over my head and I do this twice to make sure enough product has coated curls. As I do this, I rub my fingers into my scalp to get some of the product to coat my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;- I use about a nickel size once more, rub on my hands and pat/shape curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it. This is where I would pull some to the sides and secure with bobby pins if I want, or just let it air dry. I&#x27;ve dried with a warm air/diffuser, but hair works better for me. My hair pretty much dries in place without too much shrinkage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the days between washings, I will still wet my hair in the shower, comb through, and air dry. If my hair feels thirsty or is hard to shape with my fingers, I use the nickel size amount. This product is a little pricey, but it has taken me about six months to use a small bottle. I use the most on shampoo days when I&#x27;ve washed the old product out. And again, I only shampoo about every two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this for very fine hair. It may not soak up the product very well and just end up greasy feeling. My thick hair sucks up this product and remains satisfied. I do wish this didn&#x27;t have so many chemical-ly, un natural sounding products in it. Until I find a more natural or organic solution, I will continue to use this.NOT use anything but my fingers)  - I pat VERY gently with towel and squeeze out what I can  - apply Mixed Chicks, about a 50 cent piece worth to my hands and rub together  - run the product through with my fingers from scalp to ends.

    <li> Finally. A product that works with my curly hair. After years of looking for the right product, I found it. My hair is more manageable and the frizz factor has been reduced significantly. I wouldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I bought this leave in conditioner, and it wasn&#x27;t any better than my $3.17 conditioner, actual that one works better. you have to use to much product to get a curl</li>
    <li> I am biracial, black and white and I have ALWAYS had problems with my hair. I would always have to flat iron it straight because wearing it curly was not an option since I just looked like a frizzy poodle and got made fun of all the time. Since I found Mixed Chicks and I also use Hair Milk by Carols Daughter because it gives a little extra control for mixed hair that leans more towards kinky, and once I learned the RIGHT WAY to apply it, which is the key, I can truly say I love my hair now, almost a little conceited about it, and I will never straighten it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the shower, I use the deep conditioner, and comb my hair out at that stage. I don&#x27;t even bother to use shampoo anymore because the detergents in it just dry out my hair even more. My hair is still clean and doesn&#x27;t smell or anything. I just think shampoo is just unnecessary for curly hair. Anyway, I leave a little of the deep conditioner in it when I&#x27;m rinsing it out and then gently wring my hair out. Once out of the shower, I part my hair in 4 sections and I mix about 2 TBSP of Mixed Chicks Leave In Conditioner in my hand with about 1 TSP of hair milk from Carols Daughter together and twist it into each section of my hair. So overall I use 8 TBSP of the Leave in Conditioner and 1 TSP of Carols Daugther&#x27;s Hair Milk. Then I combine the 4 sections and twist it all together. After that I try not to touch it until it&#x27;s dry. I put it into a bun for a few hours or just let it hang dry. When it&#x27;s dry, I don&#x27;t have frizzy poodle hair anymore, just pretty curls. And I only have to wash my hair every other day, or every two days. Since I&#x27;ve been doing my hair this way, two years ago, it has grown about 6 inches and is really healthy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Mixed Chicks for changing my life and helping me to love myself more. (&#x3D;</li>
    <li> I have very thick, wavy hair with a combination of soft fine hair and kinky darker hair. For years I have been using gels, conditioners, mouses...anything and everything to try and define my curls; it was not until I tried Mixed Chicks that I finally got the results I had always been hoping for. It&#x27;s so light weight and it takes my three or four-step process down to one. It leaves my hair soft and silky and maintains my natural hair colour.&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely recommend trying this product.</li>
    <li> I do like the conditioner alot.  I&#x27;m not sure I will order it again though.  Here&#x27;s my story:  I have very thick blonde curly hair.  It is prone to frizz.  I have different types of curl going on as well, meaning, some of my hair is ringlet, some is large curl, some is wave, and parts are just straight...really crazy.  I have been using Paul Mitchell \\&quot;The Conditioner\\&quot; and I love it, but saw the reviews for this and thought I&#x27;d give it a try since it seems to be a \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; for curly hair.  Let&#x27;s face it no one says Paul Mitchell is a miracle for curls...so I bought a bottle of Mixed Chicks just \\&quot;to see\\&quot;.  I spent a couple of weeks using the Mixed Chicks leave in conditioner and comparing it to the Paul Mitchell ($10).  Honestly, for MY hair, I liked the Paul Mitchell the exact same as Mixed Chicks.  I would say they are equal...except for the price.  Mixed Chicks being more expensive ($22 with shipping).  I did not use the Mixed Chicks shampoo, or wash out conditioner.  Maybe they work better if all the products are used together, but the cost would be too high when I already know my hair looks great with Paul Mitchell and a good quality over the counter moisturizing shampoo (Dove $4) and wash out conditioner (Neutrogena $6).  If the day ever comes when Paul isn&#x27;t available, I will definitely use this (and yes, I will definitley finish using the bottle).  It is very good....just more costly and I can&#x27;t get it locally, so that&#x27;s a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I use:  Dove Damage Therapy moisturizing shampoo, Neutrogena Triple Moisture Deep Recovery Mask, Paul Mitchell \\&quot;The Conditioner\\&quot;, Paul Mitchell \\&quot;Round Trip\\&quot; ($12), Nutrisse Mousse.  And yes, if I want my hair to look great, I use ALL of it when I wash my hair, but it&#x27;s not that big a deal, I don&#x27;t have to blow dry at all.  I just apply the products (3 when I get out of the shower) and air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While using the Mixed Chicks leave in conditioner, I used all the same products I just listed....only substituting the conditioner.  I&#x27;ll say one more time...I noticed NO DIFFERENCE.  My hair looked just as good.  One other thing, Mixed Chicks says you don&#x27;t have to use other styling products with this leave in conditioner.  I did NOT find that to be true.  I tried.  I got FRIZZ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personal opinion on a styling product:  OMG you have got to use the Paul Mitchell Round Trip.  Did you see that curly haired girl during the Olympics who snow boarded?  I looked her up on the internet (can&#x27;t remember her name now) and found where she used this stuff and her curly hair looked fantastic....so I bought some....GREAT STUFF!!!  I still have to use all the other stuff, but my hair has never looked better.  The Round Trip helps define the curls and gets rid of the frizz..TOTALLY.  Thanks curly haired snow boarding girl from the Olympics!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck Curlies!!!!  Hope this helps!!!I&#x27;ll say one more time...I noticed NO DIFFERENCE.  My hair looked just as good.  One other thing, Mixed Chicks says you don&#x27;t have to use other styling products with this leave in conditioner.  I did NOT find that to be true.  I tried.

    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Softness OK, but frizz really still there. For me, Ouidad works much better and even some cheaper products. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Not at all worth the hype. Save your hard earned money because there are products on the market that are much better for way cheaper. I used it for about 2 weeks and gave it away. Try Pro-L$ne comb-thru $oftener, it&#x27;s cheaper and does a much better job.</li>
    <li> I think I will like this product for my daughter, as she gets older mostly.  She is 13 months old now and mixed with black and white.  She has short hair still and I put the leave in conditioner in her hair after her bath in the evening.  So she does sleep on it which is why maybe I am not as thrilled with the product (i.e. bed head in the am).  I am thinking as her hair gets longer I may see more \\&quot;results\\&quot; with seperating curls, etc</li>
    <li> Well i bought it over christmas (i&#x27;m of italian, spainish &amp; black decent btw) it makes my hair shiny &amp; soft but doesn&#x27;t control my frizz. (which is suppose to) I followed the direction on the bottle &amp; the online videos but it still came out even worse then before. My hair looks even more terrible. My hair is natually thick but has a wavy,curly texture i wanted something that kept my wavy curls but helped frizz. I&#x27;m so disappointed. I&#x27;ve heard so much good things about the product it really ticks me off that it worked better on my grandmothers hair she has no frizz her hair is like a white person&#x27;s but it&#x27;s curly. It made me wonder if i used it right i did like it said in the video the girl in the video had the kind of texture of hair i did but it didn&#x27;t work on me. :(</li>
    <li> I am half black half indian and my hair always been super frizzy and tangly. My hair looks great when wet but as soon as it dries (no matter the product) its shrinks half the length and looks super messy. I thought I tried everything. I did try \\&quot;Curls\\&quot; which work okay 50% of time right after my hair was washed; never the next day! Mixed chicks is the best product i have used so far! My hair stays curly even after I fell asleep with my hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a shot if you were confused like me!</li>
    <li> This product did not work on my naturally curly hair. I tried the product about three times using different amounts each time. No amount of this product gave me the naturally curly look without the hard hair crunchy hair feeling that is difficult to comb and immediate product build up. For me this is a good rinse out conditioner and nothing more.</li>
    <li> This did reduce frizz in my hair but didn&#x27;t really help with the fact that my hair wants to go off in all different spastic directions.  For a true miracle treatment, try a Brazilian blowout at your salon.  It&#x27;s expensive, but my lifetime dreams of having smooth manageable hair have finally come true.  For a much more economical choice though, this is a good product.  I didn&#x27;t find it to be too sticky as some reviewers mentioned but I did find it to have a bit of an odd smell.</li>
    <li> This product is not for everybody.  I am black with biracial parents.  I have naturally curly, wavy, and straight patterns of hair on my head, but mostly curly.  I shampooed and conditioned my hair.  Afterwards, I sectioned my hair and used a substantial amount of the leave-in conditioner.  I allowed my hair to air dry.  This product made my hair look dry and kinky.  It also made my hair feel dry, like it was coated with something or had a residue on it.  Maybe, I used too much, I don&#x27;t know?  I wish I had not purchased the large bottle.  This product has a great smell, but it is not for me!  Nevertheless, I guess I will have to keep spending money, until I find what works for me!  The next product on my list to try is, Designline&#x27;s \\&quot;Curl Lock\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> This works well in my daughter&#x27;s hair. Her curls are nicely defined after use and it doesn&#x27;t dry out her hair . She has type 3A/B hair. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I finally got around to trying the Mixed Chicks Leave-in conditioner and I love it.  I have spent a lot of time looking for products which will work with my hair and mixed heritage (I think my curl is 3B or C).  I am pleased to say that this did the job very well.  It actually replaces the curl cream and scrunch mousse (Garnier products) ....I can use the leave-in conditioner and scrunch with better results.  I used my normal shampoo and conditioner (infusium)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My curls are very defined , soft and look glossy and healthy.  I am getting so many compliments.  Please read how to care for curls also, good products are half the battle.  It is really imporant to respect the delicate nature and associated drying-out problems which all curls endure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be happy to buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Ok first I want to start out by saying I am 27 years old and have tried numerous products on my hair and this tops every product I have ever used! I am black/Creole and my hair type is 3c just like the actress Rachel True.  Before I would use like four different products on my hair everyday to tame my curls such as gel, spray gel, hair spray and curling cream but now all I need to use is ONE product and that is MIXED CHICKS! I will never go back to hair gel again. My hair drys faster and it takes me so less of a time doing it each morning. I never have gave a review on a product before and this is my first time, that goes to show how great this stuff is! God bless the women that came up with this product! lol!</li>
    <li> Mixed chicks worked great on my hair for the first few months I tried it. It was one of the few products that could tamed my frizzy hair during the summer time. However,this product leaves a lot of residue on your scalp. I also didn&#x27;t like how the silicons in this product left my hair looking like a Jerry curl.  I eventually stopped using this product because of the quick build up. I had to wash my hair more than usual which left my hair drier than ever.</li>
    <li> I love this contitioner, I finally found \\&quot;ONE\\&quot; product I can use that makes my hair curly.  Before, I used to use 4 different products and still could not get the results I wanted but with the mixed chicks conditioner I just wash my hair, apply the conditioner and go.  It saves me time, money and my hair finally looks good and healthy.  My natural hair is wavy and puffy, I did the keratine treatment last year so I have the option of using it straight or curly.  With other products my hair didn&#x27;t have the defined curls I wanted but the Mixed Chicks conditioner actually curls my hair.</li>
    <li> My children are inter-racial &amp; my daughter has a blonde afro &amp; she was always crying when it came time to get her hair done &amp; by the end of the day if was a giant frizz ball. I use detangler in her hair first &amp; then put in this product &amp; it keeps her tight ringlets, tight all day...........no more frizz.....we love it!!!  Her hair looks healthy &amp; beautiful!</li>
    <li> Omg, this product is the best of the 3 mixed chicks products that I use. To be honest I beleive this is what makes the line. It smells great it is a lil hard but to refresh o get rid of crunchiness jus a lil oil to you hair and your set. :)</li>
    <li> i had previously used samples of this in the shampoo and conditioner. works wonders for keeping natural hair hydrated and not too heavy. i searched high and low for products to use on my daughters hair.  we&#x27;ve tried carol&#x27;s daughter, dark and lovely, different brands of sephora and finally came to mixed chicks. while i am not blown away by it it&#x27;s definitely better than alot of other products i&#x27;ve come across. however, my search definitely hasn&#x27;t ended....</li>
    <li> OK.  I&#x27;m 50, wear my hair a little longer than shoulder length and have tried freakin&#x27; EVERYTHING for my curly hair!  A month ago, I noticed a curly-haired co-worker&#x27;s nice curls and commented on them ... she uses Mixed Chicks.  I really like the product.  I normally wrap my hair in a towel after washing.  As SOON as the towel comes off, Mixed Chicks goes on. I diffuse the underside, lightly spray top and underside and that&#x27;s it.  As it finishes drying on its own, I lightly \\&quot;re-squeeze\\&quot; curls, which eliminates any crunch - it&#x27;s important not to \\&quot;over-handle\\&quot; drying hair, as all us curly-haired chicks know that over-handling promotes frizz.  Too bad if you think alot of this product is required for your hair - the more mane, the more product ... but it&#x27;s so worth it.  Think of all the miserable frizzy days, where but for that frizz, you&#x27;d be looking FIERCE.  : )</li>
    <li> I was not impressed with this conditioner especially for the price. My hair was very hard when it dried and I could not comb it out. I had to wash my hair again.</li>
    <li> By the recommendation of my hair stylist, they recommended this as my leave in condition since my salon brand stopped making theirs. I have very curly hair.  I&#x27;m very happy with this product and was happy to find it at a more competitive price on Amazon. Haven&#x27;t tried their other products but I do love this one.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it all the time on dry, wet or &#x27;in-between&#x27; hair. It is great as a daily product and is one of the only products that does not leave a heavy residue on my kinky but soft hair even when I use it many days in a row. I also normally get a little rough skin/some small &#x27;pimples&#x27; on my forehead from other products - but not from this. In addition, the smell is very subtle and pleasant - something I appreciate since I don&#x27;t like strong smelling products.</li>
    <li> I am on of those people who has a many different textures of hair, but mixed chicks does not discriminate. It allowed my hair to look stylish and presentable from just wetting my hair and leaving the conditioner in it. Awesome and this seller delivered it fast and on time</li>
    <li> My sister kept telling me to try this &amp; when I finally did I was thrilled with the results!&lt;br /&gt;You do need to use a good amount but then my curly hair is almost to my waist (when straight) and thick. It waves/Spiral curls up. Using the Mixed Chicks defined my curls, gave me zero frizz and held them for up to three days! After three days I got a little less definition and some slight frizz but I could still rock a poneytail and not look crazy.&lt;br /&gt;Highly reccomended.</li>
    <li> Mixed Chicks really works. I have a really frizzy part in the middle of my hair that usually take a lot of products to tame. Right I after I used the deep conditioner I saw an immediate tame of the frizzes. I was sorda skeptical about just using a leave-in condioner as a styler but it really works! It does dry hard at first but softens up as the day goes on.</li>
    <li> I had given up hope and was going to make an appointment to get my hair cut. I&#x27;d gotten a perm maybe six weeks ago, and it was apparently one perm too many. I&#x27;m Caucasian with longer than shoulder length hair and would get perms so I wouldn&#x27;t have to \\&quot;style\\&quot; it. Well, this was a disaster....the first week or two it was okay, then my hair became a tumbleweed texture and wouldn&#x27;t curl at all. I used Infusium 23, Pantene, Biolage, and nothing helped. Until now. I used Mixed Chicks Leave-In Conditioner yesterday, and the curl is actually visible, and it feels a LOT softer. I&#x27;m pretty impressed with the stuff! Anything that could bring the curl back and soften it gets a 5 star rating in my book!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my baby who has curly frizzy hair and baby oil just made it look too oily. It actually defines the curls and makes it much easier to manage.</li>
    <li> Not quite sure what the big hype is for this product.  I tried it and it just made my hair crunchy and dry.  I actually didn&#x27;t buy it on Amazon (purchased @ beauty supply) so thankfully I was able to return it. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I love Mixed chicks leave in conditioner! I know, no matter what, that this product works. At least for me. I do believe it works on any curly hair type. As a hairstylist I can make it work on anyone. It&#x27;s just that with people&#x27;s personal likings they might not like the feel of it. Mixed chicks does dry crunchy because it makes the curls hold but when your hair is completely dry it will either soften up on it&#x27;s own or you have to do it and I would use a silk gloss drop for that, it helps make hair shiny and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very first time I used this product I was disappointed but then I learned how to apply it on right and that may be most people&#x27;s problem. Another thing you have to remember is that everybody&#x27;s curl pattern is different so don&#x27;t expect your hair to look exactly like the girls in the pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it is very moisturizing but I use devacurls set it free spray for moisture and that product and mixed chicks work GREAT together! because my hair ends up feeling really soft and moisturized...so I definitely would use this on clients but right now my client&amp;egrave;le is focused on weddings!</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Mixed Chicks\\&quot; hair conditioner is a very great hair conditioner for curly hair.  This leave-in conditioner has a pleasant scent and is best to put on wet hair.  I purchased this conditioner because I am mixed race with curls that are greatly helped by certain conditioners.  In addition, the conditioner leaves my hair feeling soft and makes my hair more manageable.  However, I feel that many people with curly hair are going to be helped by this conditioner, regardless of racial background. \\&quot;Mixed Chicks\\&quot; hair conditioner is great for anyone that is looking for a conditioner to style their curly hair.</li>
    <li> Does the trick have gottenplenty of complements from women on how good hair looks with it...men plz take care of ur hair...chicks dig it i promise they will touch u more lol</li>
    <li> I have Greek hair and it&#x27;s more puffy and fluffy than curly. This is the only product that takes my pouf and turns it into soft curls. I apply a small amount on wet hair, scrunch and then it air drys to really soft curls. It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve found that does it. All other curl activators don&#x27;t control my frizz or leave me with curls.</li>
    <li> Finally! a product that takes away the \\&quot;fuzz\\&quot;, let&#x27;s my curls form beautifully, leaves my hair shiny and natural looking and feeling! No Crunch! you can&#x27;t even tell or feel that there&#x27;s product in my hair. Also a very light calming scent. I love it!! BTW, I&#x27;m a white chick (Italian), naturally curly fine hair that&#x27;s been getting curlier as I get older lol. I&#x27;ve tried tons of different products, but never as good results as this one :) Thanks to my co-worker and fellow curlygirl, Samantha, for turning me on to this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and decided to try it on my own hair. I am 52 years old and have only had long hair for a few years, so it&#x27;s been a very rough uphill battle to try to figure out what to do with my curls to reduce frizz. This is it!!!  My hair did look like it had gel init when it dried, but a very light scrunch/fluff and I had the curls I always wanted. Love, love, love this product!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for me and my daughter, both of us have curly hair.  I like it in her hair, but it made mine feel a little greasy and weighed down. But not a bad product, everybody&#x27;s hair is different!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner on my 4 year old african american biracial daughter for two years and I&#x27;ve recently realized that is it NOT an all natural product. I am so bummed and disillusioned. I thought I was doing right to leave this conditioner in her hair day in and day out, only to find I&#x27;ve been subjecting her to hair poisoning! I do like how this product works, though it does leave a build up after a few days, but I cannot in good conscious continue using this product. I am now on the search for a sulfate and paraben free conditioning alternative. So far, Deva Curl \\&quot;No Poo\\&quot; shampoo has been working well, but now I need to find the right conditioner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for almost a year now and all I can say is it is truly amazing!  The curls are so soft and no more frizz!  I have tried so many different products but nothing has compared to this!  Nothing has even come close.  If you are in need of some frizz control and want your curls to pop......this is the product for you!  I am a customer for life.  Not to mention they have wonderful customer service!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I mix it with 50% water, as it is very concentrated and it works really well.</li>
    <li> It works OK, but it seems to make my scalp very dry. I just wasn&#x27;t overly thrilled with the results i got. I think for this price you could get a much better product if you go with something else.</li>
    <li> I am loving this product. I am all about making everything easier and faster and I love that I only have to use this 1 product for my hair. It leaves me with nice and defined curls, and it smell&#x27;s great. I use a little argan oil after it drie&#x27;s or I diffuse but that&#x27;s only because I love that stuff too....Must try for all curly girl!</li>
    <li> i have been using mixed chicks for about 5 years now and it works wonders! i have naturally oily skin and it is also very thick, so i very rarley wash my hair until i go to the hair salon (yuck!) but mixed chicks works very well and you will honestly get your money worth. you dont have to have 50/50 hair for it to work either! i am more or less mixed (67.4 black and 32.6 white to be exact) and it works wonderfully! if you do buy this product for the first time i would advice you to comb through your hair thoroughly. After your done washing and combing, take little sections of her and twist left (massage leave in conditioner when twisting) until in a bun and put a bonnet on and sleep over night, when you get ready in the morning take the twisty buns out and your hair will be very curly.</li>
    <li> Will be brief. Best stuff I&#x27;ve put in this mop of mine in years. Great service. Will buy again and will try other products. I recommend, highly.</li>
    <li> In the past, I have used multiple products other than shampoo on my fine, curly hair: conditioner, gel or mousse, and a shine product.  Sometimes, the combination left my hair feeling oily.  Other times, it was frizzy.  I rarely wore my hair curly, but almost always blow dried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Mixed Chicks, I use only two products: the deep conditioner and the leave-in conditioner.  The leave-in conditioner functions as both to condition and hold the hair.  However, it&#x27;s used while the hair is fully wet, and not even towel dried.  This helps distribute the product.  I&#x27;m not crazy about that because it seems to take forever to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are great. My hair is left with springy, shiny curls.  They look even better the second day.  Now, I almost always wear my hair naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the only tough thing is figuring out how much to use.  Even on the company web site, the owner show two different amounts.  One says she uses about four quarter-size amounts.  The other said she uses about two handfuls.  I have shoulder-length hair.  I use about two quarter-size amounts.  If I had to use two handfuls, I probably wouldn&#x27;t use it because it would be too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Early on, I used too much, and it dried crunchy.  It&#x27;s also important to crunch the hair and fluff it out after it dries to prevent this.</li>
    <li> This product is very good. My Daughter has very curly hair and was very hard to keep it looking nice since she&#x27;s just a toddler. Now we both use this product and we have frizz free curly hair.</li>
    <li> I am puertorican and my daughter is half jamaican.....we have different types of curls but this product worked great for the both of us. Shipping was super fast. Only down fall is that you may need to use more product than advised so it may not last as long. I dont even have to use gel or moose on my hair with this which is a miracle because my hair frizzes so fast......but not with this.</li>
    <li> First let me say that I purchase a lot of products, and never feel compelled to leave reviews about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is not really curly, but it is very thick, frizzy, and wavy. It doesn&#x27;t look  good at all in its natural state and so 99% of the time I just throw it into a ponytail due to convenience. On \\&quot;special\\&quot; occasions I will put the time and effort into straightening it (and due to how thick it is--it takes a lot of time to blowdry + flat iron!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After first reading about Mixed Chicks I was very reluctant to try it. Couldn&#x27;t justify the money and really had no idea if it would even make a difference on my hair. Finally, many months later I decided to just go for it. I got the shampoo, deep conditioner, and leave-in conditioner. I have to say, WHAT A DIFFERENCE! My frizzy, wimpy waves are actually pretty curls now. It&#x27;s way beyond what I expected, I would have been happy if it just tamed the frizz and didn&#x27;t dry my hair so much, I was not expecting the curls but I will happily take it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no added effort either, I can shampoo and condition my hair as usual, and let it air-dry without having to worry. Love it!</li>
    <li> Let me start out by saying I used the products exactly as the instructions stated.  I had extremely high hopes for the Mixed Chicks products (I tried the trial pack that contained all three -- which is a very good deal).  It&#x27;s enough for more than one application.  Unfortunately, after I used the shampoo, my hair felt WRONG, it felt a little hard and matted (I have 3c hair).  Then when I put in the deep conditioner in my hair felt MUCH better.  So I thought, ok, this might work.  And then when I applied the leave-in conditioner, it felt nice.  The problem is after my hair dried.  I have fine hair, so as the MC video instructed, I did not use alot of product.  However, my hair still was a little hard and \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; after it was completely dry.  And on day two, it felt really dry (even after I applied the Daily Moisturizer that I use ... which normally does a very good job.  So, this hardness, crunchiness, and dryness of my hair prompted me to research the ingredients in the MC Products and I found that the shampoo contains tea lauryl sulfate which is VERY drying for the hair.  I will not be buying anymore of this product for ME.  I am sure it works for some people, as evidenced by so many rave reviews.  But it does not work for ALL of us Mixed Chicks!</li>
    <li> I dont really like it I wasted money on this</li>
    <li> I love love love this product I needed something that would tame my sons curly hair, he has such beautiful hair but it always stayed so dry, once i ordered the mixed chicks leace in conditioner for my son after washing his hair and applied the product his hair turned out amazing it was soft and smelled oh so good i highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is my holy grail. My slightly wavy hair is unbelievably curly when I use it. My hair is soft &amp; not crunchy or sticky. The curls are defined &amp; last for days. I add a pea sized squeeze of Catwalk Curl Amplifier, which helps define &amp; shine.</li>
    <li> I give this product 5 stars!  I am half Puerto Rican and half Lithuanian.  My hair is a 3b and I absolutely love this leave-in conditioner.  I have searched so long for hair products for my thick, 3b, corkscrew naturally curly and naturally dry hair.  What I love the best about this product is that it not only thoroughly moisturizes my curls but it also stretches out my curls as they dry.  Usually after washing my hair and letting it air dry, my curls curl up to my ears which I hate because in reality my hair is down to my shoulders and it takes a couple of days before my curls start stretching out in-between washes.  Bravo Mixed Chicks!  I hope this stuff is around FOR-EVAH!  For me the shampoo and conditioner work incredibly as well.</li>
    <li> I used this product while transitioning from relaxed to natural.  Mixed chicks is awesome.  When I recently did my big chop mixed chicks worked even better for my coils.  My coils are springy and soft full of body not frizzy.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair that will hold a curl if I curl it, but it gets very frizzy when it is humid out. I figured I&#x27;d try this since it got a lot of good reviews.  I didn&#x27;t really control the frizz and when I curled my hair it didn&#x27;t seem to get as curly as without the product - as another reviewer said, it seems to weigh down the curls.  I&#x27;ve tried it multiple times now following the directions and adjusting the amount but it just isn&#x27;t right for me.</li>
    <li> This one was bought so I&#x27;d have a month&#x27;s worth to carry on a trip to UK and South Africa. I get out of the shower and just do a pat down with a towel on my hair, one pump squirt of this great product and then work it into the hair evenly.  Gives me the best Whte-boy Jeri-curl you ever saw!</li>
    <li> It works well... And it curls my hair and my hair is super straight</li>
    <li> I have typical mixed (Black and White) hair.  My hairdresser puts a mild texturizer in it to make it more manageable, and I often wear my hair curly.  This is a wonderful product for eliminating frizz and creating soft, beautiful waves/curls.  Before Mixed Chicks, I used a gel product which only dried my hair out over time.  I am blown away that my hair looks and feels wonderful without any gel! Super!  Sure, nothing beats spending 60 bucks to get my hair conditioned at the hairdresser, but this is the best at-home, affordable product I&#x27;ve tried for Mixies.</li>
    <li> I have short fine thin curly hair - basically like the baby hair I had when I was two.  Most products either leave my hair weighted down and oily looking or don&#x27;t do enough so it looks frizzy and out of control.  Rinse-out conditioners are too heavy, serums too oily and spray-ins too light.  I use a leave-in as my only styling product, and just air-dry my hair.  So the product I use must do a lot:  de-tangle, condition, curl, give some volume PLUS control.  Mixed Chicks is the perfect product for my hair and does all that I need.  Next time, I will invest in a larger bottle.</li>
    <li> I just recieved the mixed chicks product and i love it! I am half white &amp; black and i also have very thick curly hair, nothing else seemed to work but I came across mixed chicks and read allot of good reviews so I gave it a try.. its gentle and it smells so good...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a mixed chick and it&#x27;s always hard trying to keep your curls in place without the frizz, and mixed chicks works great. I will not use anything else 5* I Love Mixed Chicks Leave In Conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have a 12 year daughter who is black/mexican with fine curly curly hair.  I have tried everything under the sun to make her hair manageble.  My hairdresser gave her samples of the mixed chicks shampoo and conditioner and i have to say hands down!  We finally found something that actually works.  It is so much easier to brush and the curls actually look like curls.  Her hair looks longer as opposed to her hair bunching up and looking like a big ball of hair.  We are definately purchasing the bigger bottles.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000G1MT2U Mixed Chicks Leave-In Conditioner 10 fl oz (300 ml)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thick and curly and the Holy Grail for me has been to find a product that controlled the frizz, defined the curl and left it soft and shiny.  My previous trials with leave in conditioners left my hair with a dull matt look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Mixed Chicks all that is over. I feel this is a range that really speaks to my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Mixed Chicks!</li>
    <li> I love this product, I have recently ordered a second bottle. I have curly / wild-ish hair, so this product actually calms my frizzes and makes my hair more manageable and soft. I think this is gonna be one of my must have products.</li>
    <li> great curl definition, but didn&#x27;t really help with my frizz. also didn&#x27;t do much for shine. i do have a tiny afro and maybe once my hair grows and i can better spread the product through my hair, it will give better results.</li>
    <li> This product is the best thing that&#x27;s ever happened to me. I mean OMG! I am Half Cuban and Half Black, and my hair is very thick, wavy, frizzy,and coarse. I have tried so many products on the market, that claim to be the best, but has done nothing, but disappoint me. However, mixed chicks proved to be one of the best products, for anyone who has wavy, or curly types of hair. Try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed! I love how it makes your hair feel soft,how it dries afterwards. I&#x27;ve been struggling with my hair for many years, trying to find products to help me cut down my frizz. now I don&#x27;t have to struggle with my dryness, from all the mousse and gel that I constantly, had to use on a regular bases. I mean this is really a happy moment for me. Some people may say, oh what&#x27;s the big deal? well the big deal is, I finally found something that actually works!</li>
    <li> I have tried everything on my daughter! I finally gave up and just made sure to always keep her hair up and braided/twisted. She is black/white mix. I heard about this stuff from a waiter at a restaurant but never bothered to try it. I came across it by accident online and decided to give it try after seeing all the before and after pictures on their website (especially the one of the little girl that had hair just like my daughter). I&#x27;m completely blown away! This is the best product I have ever used on her. Her hair looks great and it is soft to the touch. I also love the smell! I have no idea what the other reviews are talking about when they said their hair was hard and crunchy after using it. I can&#x27;t figure out why it&#x27;s not in more stores... hopefully in time it will be but until it is I will be ordering mine online. I am sold!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product since it was marketed toward African American and Hispanic users. It was recommended to me by a friend though so I gave it a try. My daughter (who is 2) is Jewish/a million other things and has very curly hair. My husband has very curly hair, but keeps it really short. I have straight hair that can&#x27;t take conditioner so I was baffled on how to deal with our daughter&#x27;s hair. This product has saved her from looking like a homeless child, ha. I put it in after her bath and I spray her hair in the morning with a mixture of this product and water and just scrunch it a bit. The curls hold all day and look adorable. I don&#x27;t have to mess with her hair all morning and I can finally give up trying to put a bow or something in her hair to keep it out of her eyes since this product will actually hold it off her face. The best thing was that I left it at home on a recent overnight trip and was able to just wet her hair a bit to reactivate it and the curls still held all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reason I love it is that my daughter has sensitive skin and it hasn&#x27;t caused any reaction at all. This is pricey, but I can tell it will last a while and I really think it is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Mixed Chicks leave-in conditioner defines my curls and leaves my hair feeling clean and free of build up. It doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch like the cheaper brands, btw I have natural 4b hair. I&#x27;ve tried many leave in conditioners but I think this is the one I&#x27;ve been searching for. It&#x27;s perfect for use as a setting lotion or a wash-n-go.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of all the reviews and a video on youtube. The results were nice but I have found many other products costing around $3-$10 that give the same results. This product didn&#x27;t leave my hair as moisturized as most others I have tried do. So nice product, but the results aren&#x27;t amazing enough for the price. I will not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Product was just ok for me. My daughter loves it however and she uses this all the time. I have very tight girls and was looking for something to relax my curls a little.</li>
    <li> I bought this product on my sister&#x27;s recommendation.  We both have what can only be described as Irish/Sicilian afros -- our hair has tight curl and gets very brittle.  I have found leave in conditioners that work pretty well, but Mixed Chicks seems to have gotten it JUST right!  This conditioner, in conjunction with the shampoo, gives me the hair that I had always admired on other curly girls -- every curl is defined AND has movement rather than being stiff from a product that is too thick.  I LOVE this formula.  My daughter also has unruly hair and Mixed Chicks shampoo and conditioner have helped make her morning dreadlocks a breeze to get through.  LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> I am 15 and have already spent probally hundreds of dollars on products for my crazy, un tamable curls (all of those products sit in a bathroom cabnet under the sink due to the fact that they don&#x27;t work and are rip offs). This product along with its shampoo and conditioner really do work! All I have to do is wet/wash my hair every night before bed, flip my hair over while it is still wet and run my fingers through my hair with a quater sized amount of this product, part my hair and go to bed with my hair splayed out like a fan aroung my head. This really does work and I would recomend it to anyone who thinks their curls are awful frizzy things, whose only solution is to straighten them out. Don&#x27;t by the way!! Curls are way more fun!</li>
    <li> I am a mother of a black/puerto rican daughter...Whose hair is very curly. However, upon ordering Mixed Chicks...Our war with the comb is over! Her hair is beautiful and the frizz is GONE!!!!!!!!!!! This product was ordered on a Thursday and recvd. on Saturday...How great is that....And, the customer svc. (Brad) was wonderful and very helpful with ALL my questions. I was sent samples to try and now I am hooked for my daughter...Thank you and hope this is helpful for any mother who has to go to war with a 3 yr. old and a comb.</li>
    <li> Definitely a magic product. No more gel or mousse or serums needed.  Just shampoo, condition, towel dry and put this leave in conditioner in and leave hair to air dry.  I don&#x27;t like the wet weighed down curl look, and this lets my hair have the volume it wants while making my curls shiny and defined.</li>
    <li> I found Mixed Chicks Leave-In Conditioner after an exhaustive search for a product that softly defined my curls, kept frizz to a minimum, and didn&#x27;t have the stiffness left by products containing alcohol. For curly hair, do NOT comb or brush your hair. After shampooing, use a conditioner that you wash out. Then, wring hair dry. Scrunch out excess moisture with a towel. Put some Mixed Chicks Leave-In Conditioner in your hands and scrunch it through your hair. Then, take more product and \\&quot;rake\\&quot; it through the hair close to your scalp. You can use a bit more to outline the curls around your face and just at the ends. It&#x27;s a bit of trial &amp; error to determine how much you need, but this product is the ONLY one I use anymore. If you aren&#x27;t using Mixed Chicks shampoo &amp; regular conditioner before you use their leave-in conditioner, be sure to use products without sulfates.</li>
    <li> This really is a great product.  I&#x27;m half black/half white (3C hair) and for years it&#x27;s been hard to find products that will make my hair look AND feel great.  This stuff is not just leave-in conditioner, but it will also replace mousse or a medium hold gel.  I would not recommend using this with another holding product, but every type of hair is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little wary of the reviews that I&#x27;ve seen on Mixed Chicks  (they seemed a little too good to be true) but my hair has never looked and felt so great.  I&#x27;ve been complimented by people I didn&#x27;t even think would notice!  Plus, it smells great!  I will definitely buy more and more of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I recommend buying the shampoo and deep conditioner as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;About 9 months ago I quit using Mixed Chicks products because I decided to try the Curly Girl method, which involves eliminating certain ingredients that this contains.  I will not change my star rating because it is still one of the best non-CG products I&#x27;ve used, and it totally changed my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I would like to mention that after hanging around the naturallycurly.com message boards, I have found that you either love this product or hate it.  I am saddened that several people have tried this with poor results, and it just goes to show that people with similar looking hair can still require different types of products for their hair.  If that is you, I&#x27;ve heard good things about Blended Beauty products, so maybe that is the product for you.  You also might want to consider the Curly Girl/Guy (CG) method as explained on the NC message boards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to post this update on my reviews of Mixed Chick&#x27;s products as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  For those that experience \\&quot;crunchiness\\&quot; remember to scrunch out the crunch with damp hands after your hair is finished drying.</li>
    <li> MY DAUGHTERS (AGE 4 &amp; 6) ARE BLACK/WHITE AND HAVE LOTS OF CURLS. I HAVE TRIED ALMOST EVERY PRODUCT ON THE MARKET, THIS IS THE BEST FOR ANY KIND OF CURLY HAIR. YOU HAVE TO USE A LOT OF IT!! BUT IT&#x27;S WORTH IT. IT LEAVES BEAUTIFULLY DEFINED CURLS ALL DAY! THEN I RE-WET EACH MORNING. i NEVER NEED TO TRY ANYTHING ELSE!!</li>
    <li> I am half Filipino and African American and my daughter is 25% of me and 25% Kenyan. We both have really curly long hair. This stuff is awesome!! It makes my hair more curly, less frizy, and more flatter (if you know what I mean-less afro poofy would be another way of saying it!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My toddler daughter and her hair when we use the stuff, which is in the morning after taking a shower or bath, and we usually put it in her hair straight out of the shower. She is sensitive about anyone touching her hair, combing her hair, etc. With this stuff it makes it more easier for her to do her hair and the conditioner allows it to go through her hair with no problems. It looks awesome in the morning, but towards the afternoon does tend to poof up a little bit more but less than before finding this stuff. Before used to use blue magic (deep hair conditioner), baby oil, or pink oil conditioner but like this stuff much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we always get great comments now about our daughter&#x27;s hair. I could go on and on, but I will just say we are half way through the big bottle (little bottle way too small) and about to buy more!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best results have come from the following usage:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. put mixed chicks leave in conditioner in one&#x27;s hair whether child or adult straight out of the shower with hair still very wet.&lt;br /&gt;2. Use comb or brush (not with big, thick thistles) that is thin and seperated.&lt;br /&gt;3. If going to style, style it at that time as it will be easy to do at this time. If leaving down natural, do not fuss with the hair several times or it may dry out and look poofy. When wet, use enough of the conditioner,that it is stringy curly and it will mostly dry this way toward the end of the day. when using hair oil silk to make shiny do this but proceed with more leave in conditioner on top of this.&lt;br /&gt;Let set in and see results.&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck&#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I have fine very curly frizzy blonde hair, I used mixed chicks as directed by their website (using less then recomended since my hair&#x27;s fine) and the results were fantastic, the curls are defined, shiny, and so soft! It lasts 2 days with no problems. I highly recommend it. Oh and use a comb as the directions say before you put it in not a brush, it does make a difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not the target audience for this product.  I&#x27;m about as white as they come, but have insanely thick, coarse hair(I&#x27;m not exaggerating, every hairstylist I&#x27;ve ever gone to has told me that I have the thickest hair they&#x27;ve ever worked on.  I figure I have about triple the amount of hair that normal people have).  For years I&#x27;d been using mousse and spray gel with varying success.  Those with curly hair will understand that you have to find the perfect balance of product or else your curls fall out into a frizzy poof ball or you have a crunchy mess.&lt;br /&gt;  I stumbled across mixed chicks and decided to try it.  It was expensive(compared to what I&#x27;d been using before) but I thought I&#x27;d give it a chance.  When I first got it and squeezed some out in my hand was sure it wasn&#x27;t going to work.  It felt like conditioner, how the heck was this going to keep my curls in check?  I combed it though my hair, scrunched it, and diffuse dried my hair.  I was blown away.  It wasn&#x27;t crunchy, or heavy.  It felt like I hadn&#x27;t used anything on my hair(and I used a good amount). The curls lasted the entire day and looked natural.  I want a product that looks like I&#x27;m not using anything at all, and mixed chicks does that.  This is the best hair product I have ever used and has has honestly saved my curly hair. It is worth the extra expense.</li>
    <li> Ehh I brought this product for my little ones, but its not really good, their hair is a little frizzy and a little out of place sometimes but I usually use another product which works, i actually just wanted to test this out because a friend gave me hers. So I have mixed kids, I&#x27;m african American and Husband is white so I do know how their hair is supposed to look. Although this product defines the curls well it leaves it greasy looking, thin and kind of flat. Please if your child&#x27;s hair looks like this it ISN&#x27;T supposed to, and it isn&#x27;t supposed to look wet or weighed down, its supposed to be full (not the wet dog? poodle look as my mom says)... so I&#x27;ll be going back to my original brand</li>
    <li> This is the best new purchase I&#x27;ve made recently. It smells great, helps define curls, keeps hair from looking frizzy and keeps hair moisturized and feeling soft.</li>
    <li> Ok, so after reading the reviews, I really wanted it to work.  And it does, to an extent.  I have long, very thick, very tangled, curly hair that is always dry.  It does do a wonderful job of defining my curls.  But, the great look of the hair does not last all day long like some people said it does.  I have a toddler, so I am constantly putting my hair in a ponytail and then letting it down and over and over again, so the nice curl definition just doesn&#x27;t last, but maybe that&#x27;s because of what I&#x27;m doing with it.  The big con is that it does not make my hair feel any less dry or softer than it was before using it or like other people said it does for them.  I was really hoping for that.  But all in all it&#x27;s a decent product.  Not sure it is worth the high price though.  I thought I finally found a miracle product for my hair and don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll order a new one.  I do really like the shampoo and deep conditioner though</li>
    <li> Both my daughter and son have thick slightly curly hair that turns into a frizz bomb if brushed too much or not conditioned enough. My daughter started using this product first -- she now has thick, wide ringlet curls after letting her hair dry naturally which she has not had since she was a year old (she&#x27;s 18 now). Now my son uses it too. Both kids really like the scent and the consistency.</li>
    <li> When I used this product, I noticed a scent similar to relaxers(like chemicals). My hair type is 4c crown and 4b edges. I didn&#x27;t see a difference than other leave-in conditioners. When I washed it out 2 days later, my hair had excessive shedding like I had when relaxers were being washed out of my hair. Since going sulfate-free, I observe the amounts of shedding that I have because the difference has been that I shed at least 60 percent less hair. With this wash, I saw more shedding than I have ever seen since going chem/heat/sulfate free. I will be giving this to my friend who recommended this product and not using it again. I gave it 2 stars because the childrens leave-in works well on my daughter&#x27;s 3c,4a hair.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair and it has cut back on the fuzziness big time. It gives you a natural look.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner I have 3A-3C hair and it keeps it all sot and intact.  I recently had Bohyme Brazilin hair extensions installed the leave-in keeps it soft and bouncy when I do my twist-outs and my natural hair blends seamlessly.  If you have naturally curly hair you should try this.</li>
    <li> My 12 year old daughter has very curly thick hair, and this product works the best of any products we have tried (and we have tried a ton).  It leaves no build up and works great!</li>
    <li> I have never written an amazon review before but I just had to say something. I was shocked to see such high reviews for this product. It must really depend on your hair type because it did nothing for my 3c/4a natural hair. It made it sticky and crunchy and did not moisturize it. That was the most important part though-- no moisture! I was sort of impressed by the product when I first got it because I was newly natural and didn&#x27;t really realize what moisturized hair feels like. It does not feel like this. Maybe if you have naturally oily hair that needs daily washing, this product will work for you. If your hair is naturally dry like mine and requires a lot of moisture, steer clear.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Not greasy and does not cause build up.</li>
    <li> I wanted to begin using a leave-in conditioner.  This was the first one I ran across.  After 3 uses I am impressed.  My hair looks great!  Although I am not a Mixed Chick but a Caucasian dude, this stuff works well, in terms of volume and manageability.</li>
    <li> I have a very difficult time finding products that don&#x27;t cause breakouts with extended use.  This one is gentle and effective.</li>
    <li> I have thick, frizzy, curly hair. This works very well and leaves my hair soft.</li>
    <li> I have two african/caucasian girls and this stuff works great on their hair. We apply it when their hair is really wet. You do need to use quite a bit...and we have to spray their hair with water and apply it again after they sleep on it....but i have tried curly q&#x27;s and morrocan oil...nothing works as good as this stuff...We don&#x27;t use the shampoo or conditioner (too $$)- we just use pantene shampoos and conditioners and mixed chicks leave in conditioner after. Works for them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently decided to accept the reality that I have curly hair, will always have curly hair, and I shouldn&#x27;t waste time straightening it every day.  On a mission to find the perfect product I came across Mixed Chicks leave in conditioner.  Although initially I wasn&#x27;t getting amazing results, after awhile I perfected a method and now I can say this is by far the best product I&#x27;ve used for my curls.  Although it seems a bit expensive, a little goes a long way and it&#x27;s completely worth it.  I have chin length hair with a mix of 3a curls on the top and 3b curls on the bottom and this is how I use the product to end up with seriously NO FRIZZ perfect curls that are completely soft, bouncy, and shiny:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. After a shower I towel dry my hair slightly so it isn&#x27;t dripping wet, but not much more than that.&lt;br /&gt;2. I put a pea size drop of Mixed Chicks leave in conditioner in my hands and evenly distribute it around my hair. I don&#x27;t use any other products: no gels, mousses, or hair spray.  I know, it&#x27;s hard not to, but just try it.&lt;br /&gt;3. I do the twirl hair around finger trick on the top layer of my hair to make curly sections.&lt;br /&gt;4. Then LEAVE IT ALONE. Don&#x27;t touch it.  Don&#x27;t look at it.  Don&#x27;t even think about your hair.  Don&#x27;t twiddle it. Don&#x27;t scrunch it some more. Don&#x27;t blow dry it.  I know, also quite difficult.&lt;br /&gt;5. When it is completely dry (yes, completely, don&#x27;t cheat here) you&#x27;ll notice it kind of looks like you put gel in your hair: a little crispy.  Scrunch the hair a bit and the crunchiness goes completely away and you get the softest curls that have zero frizz (unless it&#x27;s like 100% humidity...no cure for that other than moving to a desert).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I follow the curlygirls method of no shampooing/avoiding silicone products/etc for the most part, except I use this product.  I haven&#x27;t had a problem with build up to this point (I&#x27;ve been using it for about two months) so I recommend trying that if you hadn&#x27;t already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: GREAT product.  Try it, if it doesn&#x27;t work for you you can always give it to another curly head friend. They&#x27;ll end up loving you forever.rk for you you can always give it to another curly head friend. They&#x27;ll end up loving you forever.</li>
    <li> At first I thought this item was really great but if left small product deposits all over my head as if I used gel. When I brushed my hair flakes of product would get on my clothes and it was hard to wash out. (I have 4a/4b hair) I won&#x27;t purchase this product again. I love the mixed chicks deep conditioner and I will continue using that product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12/29/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product now. I was using it with the eco styler gel and now that i&#x27;ve stopped using the gel with it, it works really nice.</li>
    <li> I do feel it penetrated my hair strands, but it doesn&#x27;t define your curl.  You probably need to put something else to define it and hold it in place 100%. IT IS DEFINATELY NOT THE MIRACLE YOU EXPECTED.</li>
    <li> The best stuff for people with curly hair!  I would recommend to anyone who suffers from tangles!  Need to try it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this on my now 3 year old daughter for a year and a half now. She is black/Mexican and this is the only product that has turned her hair into beautiful, soft curls.  I saw in feautured in Parent&#x27;s magazine and ordered 1 bottle.  I cannot tell you how many I have ordered since.  I recommend this to all of my friend, relative and basically anyone else that has kids with curly hair. I have even used it on my own hair and it works great!</li>
    <li> I purchased the leave-in conditioner for my 2 1/2 yr. old daughter, and received it yesterday.  I had to write my own review because I wouldn&#x27;t believe it if it didn&#x27;t see it for myself.  My daughter has never had a good hair day since the day she was born. No lie. I have spent a lot of money trying to find something that would work on her unusually soft, very, very curly, frizzy hair.  Living in humid Florida, no matter what product I used she somehow would end up looking like Don King or Albert Einstein --  the latter would be considered a good day. HOWEVER, I tried the Mixed Chicks product on her and IT WORKED!  I am still in disbelief.  It&#x27;s like a dream. Nothing has ever worked!  My husband came home yesterday afternoon and commented how Zoe&#x27;s hair is the best he&#x27;s ever seen it and what did I do to it. FYI, my husband never notices anything!  I dyed my hair several shades lighter weeks ago and he still hasn&#x27;t noticed. But he noticed my daughter&#x27;s hair.  The next day (today) I just spritz her hair with water and it looked great.  I didn&#x27;t even have to re-apply. Wow!  I&#x27;ve already told my parents and siblings (we&#x27;re mixed hispanics)about his product. The ladies should expect a lot more customers.  I&#x27;m going to tell everyone!!!</li>
    <li> Not Bad. I thought it was just a gimac buts its kind of 50/50 its not for people who are trying to define their race just to define there curls. Its not a bad moisturizer. but as far as using it as a leave in you have to spritz the hair lightly with water just so that way it is damp and then work this product all throughout your hair that is sectioned and thoroughly detangled. it&#x27;s meant for two strand twist or sometimes two strand twist to the scalp. you leave it in for a day or so and let it air dry and then take it down and your hair should be defined either by having nice loose curls or big beach waves.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this in my hair. Maybe because I&#x27;m protein sensitive and this has protein in it. It&#x27;s kind of overrate imo.</li>
    <li> This product does help define curls and fight frizz, however when it dries it leaves the hair crunchy and hard. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s only this way on african american hair, but I used it the way my hairdresser instructed which is the same as the directions and you do need to use alot of product if you have really thick hair which can be expensive since I need something I can use daily.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my hairdresser. She was right on the money.  It worked wonders on my hair.  I will definitely keep using.</li>
    <li> I love that this is the only product I need to use when I do a wash-n-go on my hair. It leaves it soft with manageable curls/waves and I can get almost four days form the w-n-g. I have a mixture of 3A/B and works like a charm. The only thing I don&#x27;t like, is that it has parabens in it. I may try the version for kids since it doesn&#x27;t have any of that. It&#x27;s a little high in price, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Always a great product that never let&#x27;s me down. I would fefinitely recommend it to all of my friends. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is a MUST for me. I have VERY CURLY and VERY DRY HAIR. If i do not put anything in my hair I would look like the before picture of unruly frizzy hair, you name it.  I have the BIG bottle with the pump. I shop around and when i find it for a good price. The best i have found was $36 for 33oz you just have to keep an eye out for those specials online. I have also bought it for $50 when i was low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After I shower I use 3-4 pumps, I put enough on that my hair looks moisturized. Everything is done with your fingers if you want your hair curly. Do not run a brush or comb through your hair.  I am PR/Italian and both sides of my family have curly hair. I have the curliest hair in the family and very dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After doing that i use Argan oil just a little,  then pantene curly mousse and then L&#x27;Oreal Mega Hair Gel . All done with your fingers only!  flip your hair wiggle your fingers shake your hair and when you are done.... do not touch your hair again.  Sounds like a lot of stuff? I do this a day or two BEFORE an event. the first day your hair will be hard, crunchy and flat. Do not play with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you go to bed flip your head and put your hair together with a scrunchy on top of your hair.  (it will probably stand straight up ) When you wake in the morning take it down and shake. as the days go on if you are like me with VERY DRY VERY CURLY HAIR the curls wind up looking so Beautiful and it can last for days. My husband loves it. When I run out of gel or mouse you can see the difference in the hold of the curls but the mixed chicks still make them look really nice, it just doesn&#x27;t last as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get a LOT of compliments on my curls!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have bought this for a lot of people and talk tell about it like i have and investment. I should get something for all the advertizing i do THAT&amp;#34;S how much i love it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we first moved to Florida before we got married i had no idea what to do with my curls, I was so upset!  I was not used to the humidity here. My hair was just awful. I went to the salon to dye my hair and they put this on my hair and sent me home with a sample. The whole car ride home i was saying to myself I am going to have to redo my hair and by the time i got home my curls were pretty nice just with the Mixed chicks which they put a lot in because my hair just soaked it up.  Needless to say i went back to buy a bottle and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF YOU DON&#x27;T HAVE DRY HAIR this may not be for you or use very little.so upset!

    <li> It&#x27;s so blasted expensive.  But it goes a LONG way.  And its WONDERFUL for my combination head of 3A and 4a  at the crown, 3c around the face and in the back (yeah, styling my hair is a chore).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is the first product that was as Curly Nikki says, &amp;#34;disrespectful to my finances&amp;#34; and I did not mind!  Its amazing.  Love it.  Mixed Chicks...we ALL are mixed ya know!</li>
    <li> This is some of the best curling stuff on the market. It actually does do what it says it is gonna do, it really does define those curls.</li>
    <li> I give this product 4 stars because it&#x27;s a bit too sticky the next day.  I like that it reduces frizz quite a bit and thus the 4 stars. Smells decent.  I recommend Kenra Smoothing Cream. Works better for day 2 after washing and smoothing frizz yet non-greasy.</li>
    <li> My daughter is mixed and I have had trouble finding a leave in that isn&#x27;t too heavy or isn&#x27;t so light that it doesn&#x27;t work. We have been using this for about a year now and it works perfectly!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect leave-in conditioner for my type of hair. It suits it well. I am mixed and have spiral curly, soft, fine hair and it&#x27;s always frizzy. This does the job. It smells nice and is not sticky, nor greasy. A little goes a long way, too.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product! It helps tame the frizz without leaving my hair stiff or sticky.</li>
    <li> Works great on ethnic natural hair. It allows my hair to spiral up and curls last all day. Will buy again!!</li>
    <li> I have two bi-racial girls with two different types of hair.  One has very dry hair that is super curly and long, the other has semi dry hair with less curl but is equally long.  I use and love Mixed Chicks products in their hair.  I tried the Mixed-Chicks Leave-In Conditioner because every other product in the Mixed Chicks line that I have tried, I have loved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found it difficult to find a product that works with both girls because usually I have to use different products for each child and even then, I&#x27;ve gone through many which just simply don&#x27;t work.  The Mixed Chicks Leave-In Conditioner did not work well for either of them.  I felt it left a lot of residue in their hair which left their hair feeling both dry and also like it was coated in almost a sticky substance.  I will not buy this product again, although as previously stated, I do love the Mixed Chicks brand as a whole.</li>
    <li> I no longer need a ton of styling products. WIth the shampoo/conditioner &amp; this, I am all set and my curls are awesome. Lots of compliments on my hair, and people are always surprised when I tell them how little i do now. great stuff.​</li>
    <li> Terrible. This is so weird feeling for a leave in. Its so thick too thick to have it for a leave in. Weighs down hair and leaves it hard and stringy. Id say this is there worst product yet. Everything else i absolutely love.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this stuff. It&#x27;s great for naturally curly hair. I just wish it weren&#x27;t so pricey. I&#x27;ll not be buying it all the time for that reason, but I would if I could.</li>
    <li> I use Mixed Chics clarifying shampoo and deep conditioned on my daughters hair. She has very tight curls and they looks perfect when they are wet. I was looking for a leave in conditioner to complete the package and keep her curls soft. This one does not do the trick. It am sells great but it hardens up and make her curls look stiff as if I had put gel or hairspray on them. I continue to use it because it wasn&#x27;t cheap and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s doing any harm to her hair. I won&#x27;t purchase it again... The search continues for a good leave in conditioned....</li>
    <li> Great for curly hair, keeps the hair moisturized all day long.</li>
    <li> Great Product- with Delivery!!</li>
    <li> this product does exactly what it is supposed to do&lt;br /&gt;it controls frizz and defines curls without leaving a crunchy feeling like mousse&lt;br /&gt;you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of product each time&lt;br /&gt;so your hair still feels clean&lt;br /&gt;good in humid weather too - though maybe you have to use a little more&lt;br /&gt;i have used this product for several years now&lt;br /&gt;and it made me stop looking for the next new product</li>
    <li> It really helps keep my curls defined all day long I really love this conditioner and I am glad I choose this product.</li>
    <li> My daughter is mixed (half white, half black). She has loose curls on top &amp; tighter curls in back. When she was younger (around 3 years old) &amp; had much shorter hair this shampoo/leave-in conditioner was amazing. It worked so well. It was supposed to enhance her curls &amp; it did just that.&lt;br /&gt;However, the older she gets, the longer her hair gets &amp; it just doesn&#x27;t work very well anymore. It no longer enhances her curls &amp; it makes her hair very tangley &amp; hard to work with. It&#x27;s almost impossible to get it soft, no matter what kind of oil or conditioner I put in it.&lt;br /&gt;I have found that it&#x27;s better to just use Herbal Essence for curly hair &amp; a good finishing oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, this is not a bad product. BUT in my experience it does not work for long hair. Shorter hair is best for this.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s the best.&lt;br /&gt;The product makes my hair silk and shiny. Keep my hair clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m due for a haircut, so I think after that I&#x27;ll have better results.  I like it!  Most curls are held in place and soft.</li>
    <li> This product works better every time it is used.It tames unruly hair and makes it shiny and manageable.I highly recommend this product to anyone who has dry frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> This product was not for me....it left my hair sticky and crunchy. When I use products, I like my curls to stay soft and it didn&#x27;t do that for me. Plus it weighed my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying a cheaper brand (garnier leave in conditioner) for 4 dollars and it worked much better. Also if you want to spend a little more money, I would buy Ojon.</li>
    <li> I read several reviews about this product before purchasing it directly from Mixedchicks.net (since I couldn&#x27;t buy from Amazon.com).  I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would turn it but I am pleasantly surprised!  My hair looks healthy and no frizzies....just cute and curly!  I have gotten several compliments on my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would be the first to say it may not work on everyone&#x27;s hair.  It really depends on what sort of \\&quot;mixed chicks\\&quot; hair you have.</li>
    <li> The thing about this leave-in conditioner is that you need a lot of product in order to achieve a decent look. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it does work... But you only get so much in that tiny little bottle. It&#x27;s kind of weird how the owners decided to make the bottle so small when the majority of people with curly hair have very thick, unruly hair. Why such a small body? Anyway, back to the point... it dries crunchy and sometimes leaves my hair hard.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I am half African American with naturally curly hair and this is the only product I&#x27;ve worn with my hair curly that I have really liked. I found that I have to follow the instructions exactly in Wendy&#x27;s instructional video or I end up with frizz. For example, if I mess with my hair too much, don&#x27;t let it air dry, or don&#x27;t apply the product when its soaking wet, it looks frizzy. If I&#x27;m in a rush I might as well not bother with it. If you tried it and it didn&#x27;t work, you might look up the video on the Mixed Chicks website or Youtube.</li>
    <li> Familiar with this product. I really like it because it works great for my 4a/b hair texture. It leaves my hair soft and silky. It has an unusual scent but it&#x27;s not overpowering. A little goes a long way...</li>
    <li> Great product for those who have a natural wave to their hair.  Not necessarily made for permed hair, like mine.</li>
    <li> My daughter has curly thick hair. This conditioner is excellent because it softens and defines her curls. I love the scent as well. Its not too over powering, its just right.</li>
    <li> I made my decision based on the great reviews here but i wasn&#x27;t impressed! I mean dont get me wrong its ok but trust me its no miracle leave in or anything like that. Heres what im wondering now that i have used it... Have the people that absolutely love  this stuff ever tried a variety of other stuff?  If you want to see a real change buy that uniq one thats the stuff you can rave about all day long.</li>
    <li> The best of the best!!</li>
    <li> Just what my biracial daughter needed for her super curly hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased it to try since a friend highly recommended it but I have very fine and very curly hair. With my hair this creates frizz. It maybe better for a thicker hair person. I also don;t care for the smell but that is a personal taste thing.</li>
    <li> Not for my 3a fine hair. I&#x27;m mixed and have hair like Jennifer Freeman or Mya. Sticky, very.&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, it worked ok for my toddler who has thicker 3c curls. I used it to smooth her hair when I braid it and it holds well. It felt gross and sticky on my hands after I used it.&lt;br /&gt;This is more of a styler than a conditioner. Nothing conditioning about it. For those who need product on their hair to hold it down, this may work. I need volume and body with definition and only mousse works for me. I&#x27;ve tried everything and am 34 and I&#x27;m going to stick to mousse and a good conditioner. I don&#x27;t know why I bought this. With so many products for curly hair I&#x27;ve found that most underperform.&lt;br /&gt; I don&#x27;t like Miss Jessie&#x27;s either. All to heavy and sticky and drying. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It&#x27;s my hair crack!</li>
    <li> Even with using a verrrry small amount in my hair it&#x27;s too heavy :(. I really like the shampoo so I had high hopes for the leave in conditioner. I&#x27;m going to try it as a wash out conditioner and see if I like it any better. For the price, it wouldn&#x27;t be worth it as a wash out conditioner.</li>
    <li> Ever since I started using this leave in, I always end up coming back to it.  I only use it on my hair wet, usually for my wash and go and I either let it air dry or I blow dry with a diffuser and either way, my hair still turns out very defined, soft and beautiful!! I can usually wear my wash and go for about 4 days with different styles, but every time I use this stuff I get compliments.  My curl type is between a 3b and 3c if that helps any of you naturally curly peeps.  However,this product isn&#x27;t the greatest in my daughter&#x27;s hair who is a 4a or b.  It just doesn&#x27;t mix well with her hair but for myself, I LOVE it!</li>
    <li> So good! It made my hair feel soft. Not too heavy for me.</li>
    <li> I get great results each time I use this to style my hair. Dries fast, enhances my curls and smells great. LOVE it! It is one of my staples.</li>
    <li> I used this product many years ago and I like so I decided to buy it to try it again</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not perfume-y, and I don&#x27;t have to supplement it with gel, which I can&#x27;t say for any other leave-in I&#x27;ve tried. I still use shampoo and a normal rinse-out conditioner along with it, and don&#x27;t recommend skipping the first conditioner if your hair, like mine, tends to be on the dry side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record: my hair is a beast. It&#x27;s long, extremely curly, and turns into a gigantic frizzy mess with very little provocation. I bought this on a recommendation from my stylist and it&#x27;s the first thing I&#x27;ve found that effectively tames my curls. A little goes a long way-- I recommend concentrating it on the tips of your hair and just smoothing a little bit over the crown. Since I started using it, I get compliments on my hair everywhere I go. The only downside is an increase in the number of strangers who ask to touch my hair... C&#x27;est la vie.</li>
    <li> At first I questioned this because I thought only mixed people could use it, I&#x27;m fully black. I have 3c/4a hair and this is like my 2nd best friend only because its a bit greasy. I use it as a leave in with water, castor oil and mixed chicks for my L.O.C method with my chunky twist outs. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair hard at all and I only have to reapply this 1-2 times a weak.  My hair was shinny, moisturized and soft.</li>
    <li> I am mixed with black &amp; filipino and have been fighting with my hair for years. My hair is kinky-wavy from my roots to the middle of the hair shaft, then it turns to wavy-straight. I was looking for a product that would keep my curls/waves intact and hopefully moisturize my hair. This product came highly recommended and I was impressed with all of the glowing reviews. I was also excited about a product that was made by fellow mixed chicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product did not work well for me at all! It somewhat kept my curls intact, but left my hair dry and crunchy. I admit, at first I used too much product. I then tried using a minimal amount which still left my hair a bit crunchy, frizzy, and dry. Not worth the $20.</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;m Jamaican, most people think I&#x27;m of a Hispanic origin. My hair is naturally thick and curly and finding a good conditioner made for my hair can be difficult sometimes. I love this product and the way it makes my hair feel. It&#x27;s really light and leaves my hair feeling soft. I don&#x27;t have to use gel and hairspray in my hair, which I appreciate.</li>
    <li> My husband is of mixed ethnicity and uses this.  His hair really does look more shinny with more controlled curls.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It works well and smells great. The only problem I have with it is the cap on the bottle.  The cap broke on the first bottle I bought and when I finally emptied it I was looking forward to having a new bottle with a lid that worked. The second time I used the new bottle it tipped over into the sink and the flimsy lid broke at the hinge (just like the last bottle). They need to improved the quality of the bottle to match the product.</li>
    <li> I love mixed chicks conditioner! It makes my hair very curly! I can&#x27;t apply too much or my hair will be sticky, but this product is my life saver because wash and gos can be so difficult!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 16 and I&#x27;m Black And Asian with 3a-3b hair. It&#x27;s extremely great with detangling, Only have to use a little and nice scent but that&#x27;s it. I want it to weigh my hair down because I have curly, poofy hair and I can&#x27;t wear my hair down.. I wander what products are better than Mixed Chicks..?</li>
    <li> I used it after shampooing my hair and it left my hair soft, manageable and smelling good.  It is a little pricey, however, you only need to use a little bit of it in your hair.  Well worth buying.</li>
    <li> Not for me! I also didn&#x27;t use it to curl my hair, just thought it would make my hair super soft as I usually use a leave in when I blow my hair out straight. I am sure it is just for curly hair though.</li>
    <li> Love it! Hair feels silky and looks shiney. My curls are beautiful and soft looking.</li>
    <li> For my hair type, this is the best thing I have ever found.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it keeps my curly hair from becoming wild.</li>
    <li> This product is not for fine or thin hair although it does what it claimed. I found it worked better on my damp hair as apposed to my wet hair.</li>
    <li> I am white but have very coarse, very curly hair.  I bought and used together the shampoo, deep conditioning, and leave in conditioner.  I LOVE the leave in conditioner.  I previously used alot of product in my hair to keep it together, and now I use just the leave in conditioner and it&#x27;s amazing.  The shampoo is good, but it doesn&#x27;t really lather.  I like a good lather sometimes so would occasionally use my husband&#x27;s shampoo when I had that need.  The deep conditioner was also terrific, thick and creamy and only a small amount needed.  I am not sure I will purchase the shampoo again but the two conditioners are definite must haves for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been long known that parabens are endocrine disruptors.  Women, especially, should steer clear of parabens because parabens have been found in human breast cancer tissue.  So, I was severely disappointed to find out that Mixed Chicks has included parabens in their products, including this conditioner.  There&#x27;s only one reason:  cheap-o attitude.  There are plenty of other preservatives out there that don&#x27;t disrupt women&#x27;s hormones, that don&#x27;t mimic estrogen like parabens do.  A leave-in conditioner is going to allow the parabens several days to absorb right through your skin into your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go to the Cosmetics Database for more info.  And, use Mixed Chicks at your risk.</li>
    <li> I have a bi-racial teenage son who decided to grow a &amp;#34;fro&amp;#34;. I ordered this because of the reviews. It has made his hair more manageable and softened his curls. Kinda have to use a lot for his hair so that means ill be buying more often so I gave a 4 star because of the price.</li>
    <li> This product alleviates the frizz. I have course, wavy, long hair and the leave-in conditioner takes the place of 3 products that I was using to do the job - a leave-in conditioner for curly hair on my damp hair, spray gel or mousse, and then an oil cream moisturizer for more de-frizzing and helping with fly-aways after my hair had dried. The first time I used Mixed Chicks, I used just about as much as I would my regular leave-in conditioner on my damp hair and when it dried, I didn&#x27;t need the last 2 steps of my usual routine! The stuff rocks! - It&#x27;s going to save me so much time and money!</li>
    <li> Mixed Chicks leave-in conditioner is the best I have ever tried. I have tried many store brands and some salon brands, but have never been satisfied with the results. I do have to work at getting the conditioner evenly through my hair, since it is long, but the result is worth it: hair that is curly without frizz. Caveat: I do not blow dry my hair. I don&#x27;t know how this product would work if I did that. Also, sometimes I add a second leave-in conditioner by Aveda, if the air is especially dry.</li>
    <li> I brought this a few months ago and love it for me and my daughter. I have straight hair that can get curly with help. My daughter has hard to manage hair. Together we use this and we look great. They use call her Chia pet. Not anymore. I brought the biggest bottle they have now.&lt;br /&gt;When I was in New York City for vacation there was a hairdress for \\&quot;The Regis and Kelly show\\&quot;.  I told him I use Mixed Chicks and he said he loved the stuff. So all the stars know of Mixed Chicks too because Halle Berry uses it also..&lt;br /&gt;Keep up the good job Mixed Chicks.....  :-)</li>
    <li> I mostly have 3c curls and decided to splurge and try this conditioner. It is a nice leave in and I like it. However once the bottle is finished I&#x27;ll go back to my Salerm 21 leave in conditioner.</li>
    <li> I am a \\&quot;mixed chick\\&quot; with very curly, thick hair and I like using mixed chicks on top of another leave in during the winter when I need extra moisture because it&#x27;s great at defining my curls and it leaves my curls soft without residue. However, I can&#x27;t use it alone. It&#x27;s just not moisturizing enough for me. I&#x27;m also not very fond of the smell it leaves in my hair. It&#x27;s not awful, but it just doesn&#x27;t smell the way I would want my hair to smell. I constantly find myself adding other products on top to mask the smell. Definitely not a product I use all year round, but it comes in handy.</li>
    <li> This leave-in conditioner is the best product I&#x27;ve found for giving me frizz-free, nicely formed curls without a &#x27;crunchy&#x27; or wet look. It works especially well when my hair is completely soaked (not damp).</li>
    <li> My daughter is mixed &amp; we have been using Mixed Chicks products for years on her hair.  I would definitely recommend this product line.</li>
    <li> it sucks- your hair feels heavy and gross. i used it during the summer and winter- regardless of the season your hair feels  worse after using it. save your money.</li>
    <li> Not a mixed chick but this is a staple for my entire household.  My children and I love this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a leave in conditioner ?????</li>
    <li> Everybody knows curly hair needs special TLC--but does it have to be a pain? Not any more, not with Mixed Chicks Leave-in Conditioner. After shampooing and conditioning, slather on this stuff, comb through--and leave it. Just that--don&#x27;t mess with your hair until it is dry. What will happen? The Mixed Chicks conditioner will soothe and coat your curls--coaxing them into corkscrews that are shiny and that stay in place. When your hair is dry, fluff lightly (not much) to loosen the wet look. Ta-da! Gorgeous, shiny, healthy curls. Not oily. Just set and natural. Really, this product is as close to a hair miracle as anything on the market for people with curls.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. My hair used to be so dry with other leave-in conditioners, and now it always looks healthy. Even when I wash my hair the next morning, it still feels so soft! Also, one bottle lasted me about 5 months (and I am not a light user). I took off one star because the ingredients sound pretty toxic, as is the smell. But I don&#x27;t mind it. Also, it does not work well with puddings/creams. You&#x27;ll need to put a styler or gel over it. Great product!</li>
    <li> Mixed Chicks leave-in conditioner is great!  I received a sample when I bought nail polish.  I had never heard of it and didn&#x27;t pay much attention to the name.  I am caucasian with naturally curly hair.  I love the way it makes my hair curly and bouncy while taming frizz.  It doesn&#x27;t feel like I have to use any other products to give me body and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  Today I saw the commercial on TV, wow, I had no idea it existed.  So, thanks to BeautyLand4U for the sample!</li>
    <li> this conditioner is so moisturizing as a leave- in, mixes well with other products, and great for wash and go&#x27;s</li>
    <li> Great product for any hair type.  Wonderful on curly hair and brings out the curls really nice.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! It&#x27;s not to heavy or greasy. I&#x27;ve been looking for a product like this for years.</li>
    <li> Would purchase this product again, made my curls really soft and bouncy .. Hardly no frizz. The price was great!</li>
    <li> This product is just okay as a leave in. It does leave my hair soft, but that&#x27;s pretty much all it does for me.</li>
    <li> I know this is called \\&quot;mixed chicks\\&quot; but I am a 19 year old guy and heard that some mixed guys use it so I gave it a shot. I am half black and half white with curly hair. A lot of guy hair products aren&#x27;t very good in my hair. Its kind of hard to find what stuff will work in my hair because I am mixed. I used to not put anything in my hair just shampoo and conditioner. When my hair gets long I can pick it out into a fro but it gets kind of dry and it falls out more when its long because it wasn&#x27;t moisturized well so I usually keep it shorter. I have switched from many shampoos and conditioners not really knowing much about what&#x27;s good and bad, I heard sulfates dry out the hair and are bad which is probably true so I stopped using those brands. I have tried many shampoo/conditioner brands such as Tresemme, Pantene, Organix a couple times and didn&#x27;t like it, and now I am currently using the Shea Butter Brand and it works ok but I still feel like it doesn&#x27;t work that good in my hair idk what brand of shampoo and conditioner to use with the mixed chicks leave-in conditioner. I have tried products like olive oil, B&amp;B, Pink stuff, Organix coconut oil which makes my hair dry and flaky, and FX curls up I have tried a couple times I&#x27;m not sure if I like it or not. I tried these products and didn&#x27;t like them very much and felt like they weren&#x27;t doing the job maybe its because some of it is just for black people and some is just for white people, I needed a product that&#x27;s in between or something, then I switch to mixed chicks. I now like my hair long and needed something to use to help  keep it moisturized. Currently my hair is medium length where its curly because I had a big fro and it got hard to manage so I got a hair cut a couple weeks ago. I think this product works good with my hair as far as I can tell, I have  been using it for about a week and a half and like it. It shows my curls good and keeps my hair feeling moisturized. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff or anything like some of the complaints say but they probably got a bad bottle of it I wouldn&#x27;t buy it off amazon. I bought it at target but wanted people to see my feedback and help me out with some questions I have, I would appreciate it if you are mixed with black and white to answer or if you have similar hair to me. I want to know what is the best sulfate free shampoo/conditioner brand to use  that is good and inexpensive or what do you use?  Also what other product should I use daily to go with the mixed chicks leave in conditioner if any? I heard Nutiva coconut oil was good but idk. Please leave helpful comments thank you if you read and commented!ike some of the complaints say but they probably got a bad bottle of it I wouldn&#x27;t buy it off amazon. I bought it at target but wanted people to see my feedback and help me out with some questions I have, I would appreciate it if you are mixed with black and white to answer or if you have similar hair to me. I want to know what is the best sulfate free shampoo/conditioner brand to use  that is good and inexpensive or what do you use?  Also what other product should I use daily to go with the mixed chicks leave in conditioner if any? I heard Nutiva coconut oil was good but idk. Please leave helpful comments thank you if you read and commented!</li>
    <li> It has a great smell.. Dries hard. I expected more from such a pricy product.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length, fairly thick, wavy hair with a bit of frizz throughout; not a lot, but enough to make it a PAIN!!  Over the years I have tried everything on the market at one time or another.  I recently stumbled across this product on AMAZON and, after reading some of the reviews, I decided I would try it.  I am so glad I did because this product is really excellent.  Although a tiny bit sticky while applying, it truly does what it claims.  It dries with no trace of sticky or crunchiness that I have gotten with other products.  It helps shape curls/waves, but also conditions my hair while it tames frizzies.  My hair no longer feels dry and brittle.  A little bit goes a LONG way so it will last a long time.  It smells very pleasant, simple and clean instead of heavily perfumed, and is easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Not impressed! Purchased for my 3 year old daughter who has fine, curly hair. I put a very small amount in her hair and it weighed her hair down and her hair seemed more tangled and harder to brush.... My husband likes the product on his hair.. He has tighter curls than my daughter.. Think I&#x27;m going to stick with macadamia products for my daughters hair. Did not like for her hair at all.</li>
    <li> My favorite curl booster - ever!</li>
    <li> The product was for my granddaughter who was not happy with it. She has soft curly hair that can tangle easily so she is always on the lookout for stuff that she put in her hair that will make it manageable. This product did not meet meet her expectations or even come close. Her hair did not benefit from the use. I gave 3 stars because it arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Mixed Chicks before and it really works well on my permed hair.  The problem I have is that I can&#x27;t find it at a local store.  It was great that I could order it on line and I think I even got a discount on the product.</li>
    <li> I am a Caucasian female with thick, very wavy hair that is beyond hard to control. I finger combed this product though my hair in the shower and used a hairdryer with a diffuser. The result was soft, flowing waves rather than a wild, untamed mess. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product works amazing on my daughters hair. She has very thick, long frizzy hair. Other leave in conditioners did nothing for frizz. Mixed chics keeps the curls bouncy with natural shine. One tip I recommend is to comb hair first, then apply generous amount of product and do not comb through again. I found that if you comb through the product then the curls lose their shape a bit and causes a bit of frizz. If you apply after combing &amp; spring up the hair from the bottom, her hair turns out perfect with no frizz &amp; bouncy curls. I definitely recommend this product &amp; only thing that works. For reviewers that complained of hair feeling sticky or stiff, it may feel like that at first but after hair is completely dry it  turns soft.</li>
    <li> I use this product on my 3 year old step daughter. she is mixed black and white. her hair without it is unruly and frizzy basically you can do just two little puffs or braids which is cute but now that she is getting older and her hair longer we looked for a product to define her curls. we spray her hair with water, or use right after bath but go through layer by layer putting product on and coming with wide tooth comb. we can leave her hair down, half up or all the way up. it defines the curls so they look moisturized and smooth. yes you do need a lot of product but nothing i&#x27;ve found works better. the bottle lasts her 3 months we use 3 times a week on average her hair is shoulder length.</li>
    <li> I just took my baby a bath, he has curly hair with a lot of frizz. After shampooing his hair with johnson&#x27;s, I applied mixed chicks on his hair while it was wet. I applied a small amount through out his hair while using a wide tooth comb and omg amazing results! Frizz free and his curls are locked in place.</li>
    <li> works great, and keeps hair looking great all day.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from a local beauty supply. At first i thought \\&quot;Mixed Chicks\\&quot;, well i&#x27;m not mixed. my Father is Black and my mother is Mixed, but i did not pick up any of her genes LOL. Anyways, I don&#x27;t know my hair type but this product works on my hair. At first it was not holding, but then i found the right amount. It really defines my curl pattern and I did not have to add any other products to my hair. It&#x27;s not frizzy and to me it looks great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product. Defines the curls and makes them soft but this is expensive. I had to use a lot so my hair would not frizz, the curl definition does not last all day. For this price I should be able to keep the curls at least a week! There are other, cheaper things out there. I&#x27;m on a budget and this price is ridiculous.</li>
    <li> Hate this product the smell and the texture are awful. The product feels sticky and is not moisturizing at all. Definitely will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> I love the way this conditioner makes my hair feel. Leaves hair with a healthy shine and prevents tangles. Love it!</li>
    <li> I am Armenian with naturally thick curly hair.  I ordered this after seeing an ad in a magazine and feeling desperate for something that works to set my curls, without holding them like a gel or mousse. I didn&#x27;t want the sticky-hold or feeling of so much product in my hair, like you get from gel or mousse.&lt;br /&gt;Well this leave in conditioner is perfect. I use it after i get out of the shower. I comb it thru my hair and let it air dry. Every time i use this I get complements on my curls!  No frizz, just nice and soft curls.  It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, which is good for me. I don&#x27;t like perfume-smells in hair products, so I&#x27;m very happy with the way this is!</li>
    <li> Great leave in for my curly extensions!!! Try it you wont be mad</li>
    <li> Product is as described.  We have found it to be the best product we have used for course ethnic hair.  We would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Why or why wasn&#x27;t this created when I went through my teenager years fighting my naturally curly Cuban hair?????  It&#x27;s wonderful, not to heavy, not sticky, leaves curls perfect, shiny and bouncy with no residue to touch.  Great price point and amazon got it here FAST!  I will buy this product forever!!!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> The search is over!  I&#x27;m not a woman of color.  In fact, I&#x27;m very fair with auburn hair that has a mind of it&#x27;s own - and if that weren&#x27;t bad enough it&#x27;s super, SUPER dry.  I don&#x27;t even want to guess how much money I&#x27;ve spent on hair products promising to control my curls (as if!) and eliminate frizz.... but then I found Mixed Chicks Leave in Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;My hair went from unruly and often downright embarrasing to beautiful with soft, full curls.  I also use an Aragon oil  and Shea butter shampoo (Organix) and Aragon oil conditioner (RenPure).  With these gems I only need to shampoo every few days and the Mixed Chicks leave in conditioner holds my curls and eliminates frizz beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;No matter what your ethnicity, if you have thick, curly coarse hair I strongly recommend this product.  Wash, condition, rub some Mixed Chicks into your hands, scrunch / shape and let it air dry.  Love your curls again!  I do :)))</li>
    <li> I love the fact I can use this as a leave in &amp; a styler it&#x27;s honestly one of my favorites</li>
    <li> This is the only product I recommend to curly hair!!!&lt;br /&gt;It is really a great conditioner to use!&lt;br /&gt; To mention that before I used it my hair was really damaged and my curl wasn&#x27;t defined I tried many products but the only one was the mixed chicks collection shampoo- conditioner and leave in conditioner that gave me back my curls in like two months!</li>
    <li> I think this conditioner worked nicely as a leave-in BUT personally I don&#x27;t think it does anything special that my less expensive over the counter products can&#x27;t do.</li>
    <li> Ok smell, does the job but use with a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Mixed Chicks Leave-In Conditioner for a few years and find it to be absolutely the best leave-in conditioner for fine hair with tight curls. It is a very rich but light cream that will remove frizz and give you silky curls if you apply generously (a little bit does not give you the full benefit of the product). I frequently get compliments on my curls, and people actually ask to touch them (yes, it&#x27;s weird) because they look so natural/touchable. I&#x27;m currently using the Mixed Chicks Shampoo and Conditioner as well; however, I&#x27;m not sure how much more benefit you get from using the full line because the Leave-In Conditioner worked wonderfully when I used it with drugstore shampoo and conditioner as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this conditioner to use on my virgin Malaysian hair extensions. My hair extensions are long and curly similar to a multi-racial hair texture. The conditioner has a citrus scent and so far it seems to do exactly what is says even for hair extensions. The first day I applied this product directly to my hair, and after a few hours my hair felt really greasy, and weighed down due to this product. So I decided to put a few drops in a spray bottle with water, and that seem to do the trick. If diluted with water this conditioner is excellent for virgin curly hair extensions.</li>
    <li> This product worked well on natural hair. I use it in hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> DO NOT purchase this product if you have 4-anything hair! It will not work! I purchased the shampoo, conditioner, deep conditioner, and leave-in products thinking that if I used them all together, they would work. Boy, was I sorely mistaken! This stuff made my hair hard and dry and left flakes. Furthermore, the shampoo has sodium-lauryl sulfate in it ( unless they have changed the formula since I bought it) which is HORRIBLE for tightly-curled hair. I gave the products to a co-worker who has a daughter with type 3 hair.</li>
    <li> I use Mixed Chicks on my daughter&#x27;s hair &amp; it really defines her curls &amp; moisturizes well. It&#x27;s a little pricy but a good product</li>
    <li> It does tame my hair and make is shiny, but if you put to much in it weighs it down. So a small amount is all you need. Helps with the frizzys!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judy Reppart</li>
    <li> Glad i only got the samples because This product had a wierd smell like old people perfume, it makes your hair dry and crunchy but gives really defined curls. I would not waste my money on this if i was you</li>
    <li> Feel free to buy this leave-in if you just want to match brands with the deep conditioner.  It weighed down my hair to much for a blow out.  I may work better with looser curly hair.</li>
    <li> Although the shampoo seemed run of the mill, the leave-in conditioner is fabulous!  It not only softens the hair, but detangles easily.  You don&#x27;t need much for great results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an African American woman with 3C hair type. The first time I used this product was in the whole little set - shampoo, conditioner, and  leave-in. In my opinion, it did not appear to \\&quot;work\\&quot;. Curls were not defined and it was frizzy and ridiculous in about an hour. Don&#x27;t get me wrong my hair felt extremely clean and hydrated but I ended up doing my usual straigtening. I&#x27;ve since figured out (1) that the set is not mandatory (2) this product has to be used a couple of times before it \\&quot;works\\&quot;(3) you need to be quite liberal with it and (4) taking from these reviews the second and third times I made a water, leave-in and hot oil 6 mix to define more for an evening out. It&#x27;s not magic nor is it a chemical treatment so it will not give you ringlets if you have 3C and higher. However it does help to maintain curly styles after the pool or the beach. Great job ladies! I am a loyal customer now.</li>
    <li> It was an ok product but really didn&#x27;t do anything for my 4a/4b hair, especially since the price was so high. Try different products before using this</li>
    <li> This is the best curly hair product for any race. Does not leave a heavy film and you can get a brush through it the next day!</li>
    <li> A friend suggested this product since I have curly hair  so I thought why not it may do something different 2 help my curls out. This product in my opinion is WAY OVER PRICES $ 23-25 a bottle  !!!! Did not improve my curl texture/hold that my PANTENE CURLY GEL DOES &amp; alot cheaper. The shipper  for this product was great  though no problems with them. I would buy from them again just not Mixed Chicks.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! It&#x27;s all you need for soft curls with no stiff crunchy hair!! Best tip: if you have curly hair, shampoo and then put on conditioner. With conditioner in hair, use a hair \\&quot;pick\\&quot; and comb through conditioner. rinse. Do not comb your hair again after that. Apply this stuff, scrunch it throughout hair, and blow out (make sure to flip down and blow underneath too )with a diffuser. Fabulous!</li>
    <li> With mixed chicks my hair has no freeze at all, will definitely consider buying this product again. Second day hair looks good too, still soft, no freeze and no tangles. The only negative comment is that I was expecting more volume.</li>
    <li> This is some pretty amazing stuff. After all the wrong products I have tried through the years for my naturally thick crazy curls, I am finally getting to the right stuff. I still think these salon products are of the best quality and actually do what they say without all the bad ingredients that do nothing for your hair but make matters worse. This is a thumbs up.</li>
    <li> This product has done wonders for my 8 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.  She is mixed race and has soft, tight curls.  I have been looking for a product that will leave her curls soft- not crunchy or greasy.  Mixed Chicks was the answer!!</li>
    <li> Any woman with curly hair, this is a must have! I am English, Irish, Scottish and German and have curly hair that was mostly just fuzzy before I started using Mixed Chicks.It never weighs down my hair and never dries it out. I go to work everyday with wet, right out of the shower hair and it dries perfectly every time.</li>
    <li> After using the deep conditioner which I absolutely love I was excited to try the leave in but wasn&#x27;t thrilled. Don&#x27;t get me wrong it had my curls looking fabulous and held its definition but it makes the outside of my hair hard &amp; the inside nice n soft lol it doesn&#x27;t keep my length either my hair shrinks up so much it looks like I got a hair cut lol AND u have to.put it on soak n wet hair, irritating. But its not a horrible product ima continue to use it until its gone but I&#x27;ll b looking for a replacement</li>
    <li> I think product is ok but don&#x27;t think I will purchase it again. It just takes way too much for my hair.</li>
    <li> This smells great. And if you have the right type of hair it really does bring out your curls. You kind of have to add a gel to make them stick around. I got this for a young mixed girl who in the end just relly likes to wear her hair bit and curless. I did get to see her with this on one time and she actually had ringlets. Her hair did shrink ALOT though.</li>
    <li> This left my hair a little flaky after my hair dried it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> Just started using this product because of my sister, like it because I have natural hair it leaves it feeling soft however, I just learned that as a woman of color we should not be using leave-in-conditioner on a daily basis so I had to cut out using it everyday after I come from the pool. The product does wonders on my hair it does not leave my hair feeling weighed down and my hair is easy to comb.</li>
    <li> Great for &amp;#34;mixed&amp;#34;  hair.  Great texture and goes on easy.  A fantastic addition for those of us with curly hair that needs a slight taming.</li>
    <li> I bought this leave in conditoner and well it didn&#x27;t work on my 4a type hair at all nor did it work on my daughter&#x27;s 3a hair. Its not worth the price and I didnt notice any differences for my month long trial.</li>
    <li> I have 3c hair and this just dries it right on out.  There&#x27;s not even enough slip to make it worth using with other products, so I just have a sad bottle of unusable LIC here.  I&#x27;m hoping one of my friends will want it.</li>
    <li> May I say, Love and Hate.  I would love this product to be my leave in and styler. But oh, the woes it causes by drying out my hair after a few days. I&#x27;ve switch to Camille Rose Naturals Line which never dries my hair out and provides all the moisture I need. But Mixed Chicks Leave-In was something I use to use back in the day. I wanted to love it because it&#x27;s of course a 2 in 1 and what curly girl doesn&#x27;t want a 2 in 1 product. But this just didn&#x27;t work or me. The only think i liked about the Mixed Chicks Leave-In was how smoothly it applied on my hair and the smell was so sweet.</li>
    <li> My wife and daughter love this... and that&#x27;s all that matters!</li>
    <li> little expensive but worth the price</li>
    <li> My daughter and I love this stuff.  Works like you can&#x27;t believe.</li>
    <li> After 10+ years of being fully natural, I became a parent and needed to make my hair routine easy for myself. I decided to very mildly Texlax my type 4 textured hair (I only will do it 1-2 times a year). Afterwards I needed to search for hair product for my loosened curls. On a whim, I purchased a travel sized bottle of this stuff and it was perfect!  I condition wash my hair, put in coconut oil, and top it off with the mixed chicks leave-in and keep it moving. My curls are moisturized and popping for days!</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair nice and shiny and bouncy without feeling like there&#x27;s something caked on. Holds my curls without feeling crunch and gives me 3-5 good days without my hair getting big and unmanageable. I use it with DevaPoo OneCondition and it&#x27;s been working AWESOME for over a year (a record - usually any regimen I find starts not working after 6-12 months)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through so many hair products for my thick, curly hair I lost count years ago. This stuff is amazing. It defines my hair, leaves it feeling nice and soft and moisturized. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it so a bottle lasts a long time. the only thing I would change is the smell. It&#x27;s not unpleasant per se, but I&#x27;ve definitely liked the smell of other products more. However, nothing compares to this in terms of how my hair looks and feels.</li>
    <li> I love this leave- in condish. It makes my 3a/3b curls come to life and go all Shirley Temple. :-)</li>
    <li> love this product! it has helped me so much over the last year better manage my curls.  Something that has always been tough to find under the frizz. which it was all natural</li>
    <li> I have thin hair that is wavy but also frizzes at any hint of humidity. This amazing product has given me the confidence to finally love and accept my curly/wavy Puerto Rican hair! Mixed chicks, best product for all ethnicities, just like it advertises: my niece has African American hair, with soft Puerto Rican texture that nothing has worked without weighing her hair down, UNTIL I gave my sister a sample of this; and my daughter has Korean American (bone straight) hair with my frizzies/fly-aways, but once I add this to it, her hair is as beautiful as we all wish ours would be; also she&#x27;s so tender headed that the conditioner part of it seems like magic,THANK YOU TO ALL THE CREATORS OF THIS MARVELOUS PRODUCT. A product TRULY WORTH 5 STARS!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Finally a product that works for me. I have curly hair and frizz that I can&#x27;t seem to control. I love this leav-in conditioner; it doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy, too shiny. It simple works for me! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great product! Performs as advertised.</li>
    <li> This was the second leave in conditioner I have ordered it did not really work for me after I wash my hair and try to comb through it it was not easy it didn&#x27;t give me a lot of slip at all and I have very fine hair, it is very thick wish I would have save my money, I purchased the Eden coconut leave in conditioner brand and I love it.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed this product, but you have to use a lot of it! you must put it in your hair when its soaking wet, right out of the shower. Doesnt work good if your hair is dry or damp.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since it first came out and wanted to expand and try other products out there. But I always keep coming back to this! This is seriously the only product that can tame my hair. I&#x27;m mixed with multiple curl patterns (3A-3C). This is the only product that doesn&#x27;t weigh down my 3A/3B curls and also controls the frizz of my 3C curls. It can be a little crunchy at first but after a few hours it softens and really defines your curls. Plus, its a leave in so you know it&#x27;s conditioning your hair. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great for my 4c hair...holds definition without making hair stiff.  Very soft and manageable. ...</li>
    <li> My daughter is biracial and has very tight curly thick hair.  I have tried tons of hair products on her hair to no avail.  This works wonderfully, it holds the curls nicely without drying.  I would recommend this product!  Only downside is the cost because her hair is so thick I have to use a lot!</li>
    <li> I heavily researched this product because I wanted to be informed before I spent $20+ bucks on a hair product for my 18 month old.  I googled and read almost every review I could find.  There are so many mixed reviews about this product, but after much thought I figured it was worth a try.  My daughter is mixed with black and puerto rican.  She has corkscrew curls (3C)that often look dry, frizzy, and \\&quot;wild\\&quot;.  I wanted to allow her hair to rest and reduce the tension on her hair from ponytails.  I reviewed the \\&quot;How to use Mixed Chicks\\&quot; tutorial online and took a risk of trying Mixed chicks on her hair prior to a wedding.  All I can say is. . .WOW!  This stuff is AS ADVERTISED!  I think I may have used too much product, but the results were wonderful!  I washed her hair, combed her hair with a Denman brush, then put in the conditioner.  The results were immediate.  She looked like she had a jeri curl at first.  As it dried (it takes awhile for her hair to dry) it retained the curliness and it did offer a little shine as well.  No frizziness at all.  None.  At that moment I said I would buy the big ol&#x27; jug of this stuff!  To address common concerns, NO-it doesn&#x27;t make the hair \\&quot;shiny\\&quot;, but you can add shine with a polishing spray.  NO-it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;stink\\&quot; nor \\&quot;smell good\\&quot; it just smells like conditioner.  The scent doesn&#x27;t stay with the hair either. YES-it makes the curls defined and YES you need soaking wet hair like the video states.  YES-it \\&quot;shrinks\\&quot; the curls. YES-it is a little expensive for conditioner. If you have been dealing with this type of hair for awhile, you will truly appreciate the results.</li>
    <li> I got this product expecting that it be the best of the best and that it&#x27;d be my new go-to product. Unfortunately when I did use it the first few times I haaaated it. I thought nothing would be able to redeem it, but to my surprise after a few uses it started to work wonderfully for me, keeping my 2c/3a curls healthy, bouncy, and moisturized. It is definitely not an all-in-one product that will hold your hair but it is a great way to start. I usually put this product into my hair when its soaking wet or at least really damp, comb through (making sure not to flatten out the top but instead separate my hair into layers and then brush through from the back to the front), scrunching, and then allowing it to dry a bit before &amp;#34;setting&amp;#34; it with a mousse, kinky curly curling custard, or devacurl&#x27;s light defining gel. I switch off between this and sheamoisture&#x27;s curl enhancing smoothie, because I feel if I use the same products/routine, my hair adapts and doesnt curl as well. A good haircut will also help enhance curls if you find that they&#x27;re not doing as well as before. I usually cut my own and just wing a &amp;#34;round layered haircut&amp;#34;. Hope this helps any of you curlies trying to get that curl back!</li>
    <li> Our youngest son who is white and black has the kind of hair most women would die for. Unfortunately he is not willing to put in the work necessary to keep it looking good that is until we found Mixed Chicks, shampoo at night wet and comb in some conditioner in the morning and thats it your done. Mixed Chicks lasts through soccer, skateboarding (with a helmet)and anything else he gets into. This was a boy who by noon you could not run a comb through his hair with out a fight. Mixed Chicks is proof God loves us and wants us to be happy!</li>
    <li> Nothing else can compare for my hair. I think I&#x27;m a 2C or something.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff for my daughters hair.. She&#x27;s mixed and her hair is wild</li>
    <li> Mixed Chicks Leave-In Conditioner helps to stop hair breakage. And that is exactly what I needed.  It is a bit too heavy for my hair, so I prefer to use it with my Creme of Nature Leave-in Conditioner adding more moisture to my hair.</li>
    <li> This is truly the best leave in conditioner for our family&#x27;s hair. My daughter and I have two different curly hair textures and it works well for both of us. It leaves our curls defined and soft. In fact my daughter&#x27;s hair looks even better the next day with the conditioner. I&#x27;ve tried using cheaper alternatives and always come back to this.  It is indeed worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> My girlfirend recommended this and said if I didn&#x27;t like it she would buy it from me. She sounded very convincing! However, this did nothing for my coarse, dry hair. It does smell good!</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic. If you have curly hair, you should try it.</li>
    <li> I am a Latina with very thin, dry, curly hair. I have tried almost every product out there, from inexpensive to very expensive, and I have wasted lots of money on products that do not work on my hair. Because my hair is thin, dry, and curly, usually products weigh my hair down. After the very first time I used Mixed Chicks Leave-In conditioner, I was amazed at how great my hair looked and felt. I actually LOVE my hair again, after years of just pulling it back in a pony tail or a bun. I now want to grow it long again like when I was a teenager! I HIGHLY recommend this product, and I want to thank the ladies who created it. I am going to tell every single person I know with naturally curly hair to try Mixed Chicks products. THANK you for setting me free from the pony tail and bun! Yeah! I can leave my hair down again!  :)</li>
    <li> I first heard about this product about three months ago from my sister in law.  I ordered it the shampoo, deep conditioner and the leave-in conditioner.  I absolutely love these products!  I have to admit that I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect because I&#x27;ve been trying to find a product that would allow me to wear my naturally curly hair without the puffy afro and the frizzy look. This product gives me the soft curls that I have been looking for.  And the price was right, I paid a little over $40 for all three products.  I have used Ouidad deep conditioner in the past and met with great results but I can&#x27;t always afford it.  But this was a pleasant surprise and I can&#x27;t speak enough about this product.  I love the fact that it&#x27;s not just for mixed chicks with curly hair (which I am) but it&#x27;s for everyone with curly hair regardless of ethnicity.  I highly recommend these products, it leaves my hair soft, my curls defined and very easy to manage.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by a friend and I absolutely love it.  When I want to wear my hair naturally curly this does the job of keeping my hair from being frizzy!!</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough about how amazing this leave-in conditioner is.  I have below-the-shoulders wavy/frizzy/poofy hair that has yet to be tamed by a single product.  I usually straighten it because it is too unmanageable and unpredictable if I let it air-dry.  This conditioner keeps it under control, lets it do its natural-wavy thing, but isn&#x27;t too heavy or greasy.  I am white, and would recommend this conditioner for women of all races and ethnicities.  LOVE it!!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful--I am a white chick with extremely thick, long, wavy, hilited blond hair. I call it a half-fro, because it is big and wants to do it own thing, it just often can&#x27;t figure out what; there is very little consistency to how my hair looks day to day.  I rarely find a stylist that knows how to style my hair much less cut it, it is super frutrating.  The curls in my hair are between a 2b and a 2c--and at times I just want to cut it all off.  It seems that curly hair products are either too crunchy or not enough hold, leaving it frizzy looking and little curl.  Mixed Chicks Leave-in Conditioner makes my hair lay wonderfully with nicely defined waves and flowy--I have literally no frizz and the next day hair is just as good as first day hair.  I am so thrilled to have found this product.  It has a nice scent and although, I always feel as if I put too much on when it is wet, when it dries it is perfect, not sticky or greasy at all. -I separate it into 4 sections and generously apply then comb through to make sure it is evenly distrubuted--after this, I use a technique I found on  naturallycurly.com called plopping to absorb some of the moisture and further develop the curls.  Finally, I dry it with a finger diffuser, it is reccomended to let it air dry but even though I live in desert, my hair takes forever to dry.  I have never written a review, but Mixed Chicks Leave-in Conditioner is so incredible that I wanted to share. I hope this review is helpful for women comtemplating using this product--it works for my hair and I never thought I would find a product that allows me to feel great about my naturally curly/wavy hair.</li>
    <li> Love this brand of products!&lt;br /&gt;More than worth the price and they work so well.&lt;br /&gt;I have mixed hair and finding products that work is impossible it seems! But mixed chicks??? they are definitely on to something, because it works!&lt;br /&gt;Smells great too!</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT BECUASE I NEEDED A PRODUCT THAT DEFINED MY CURLS THIS PRODUCT IS IT.I AM DOMINICAN AND HONDURAN SO I HAVE THICK LONG CURLY HAIR AND THIS PRODUCT MAKES MY CURLY HAIR CURLIER AND MORE DEFINED I LIKE IT.. I ONLY GAVE IT FOUR STARS BECUASE THERE ISN&#x27;T A GOOD RANGE OF SIZES AND IT CAN MAKE YOUR HAIR FELL A LITTLE CRUNCHY IF YOU PUT TO MUCH ON..</li>
    <li> Do not buy!!! When it dries it  leaves A LOT of flakes!!!! Now I have to wash again, and with thick hair, is no easy feat. Thanks a lot Mixed chicks.</li>
    <li> I have curly and coarse hair. This product is perfect for when I wear my hair curly with a little bit of mousse. When I wear it straight I also use it. Since it&#x27;s all natural I also use it on my kids.</li>
    <li> This is the only stuff that works for me! I&#x27;ve tried so tons of other products and this is the only one that leaves me hair soft and flexible not sticky at all!</li>
    <li> Decent conditioner. But for the price, probably won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on this product over a year or more ago, and it sounded too good to be true for a Caucasian girl with fine, limp hair.  All I need is a dollop and my hair comes to life, in springing, soft curls that do not leave any crunchiness or greasy residue.  If the frizz is too bad, I live I&#x27;m Florida, simply wet my curls and scrunch again, rearely do I need to add more product.  This leave  in conditioner is my best friend now!&lt;br /&gt;PS... If you use too much, and it&#x27;s not drying for you, use a blow dryer very quickly, no more than a minute depending how thick your hair is.  The curls will become soft and frizz free.</li>
    <li> I have straight hair on top and loose curls around the side &amp; back.  I found this product at my hairdresser&#x27;s salon and use it every time I wash my hair.  Smells nice, not too thick or thin and you can use as much as needed for extra hold.</li>
    <li> When I first purchased this product it took me a while to figure out just how to apply it to my curls correctly for Grade A results and when I got it down, my natural 3c hair was in it&#x27;s best shape it had ever been. Caution: YOU WILL RECEIVE MANY HAIR COMPLIMENTS! The leave-in conditioner does what it says, which is a miracle for curly-haired folk such as myself. However, after using the leave-in for almost 2 years, I realized that my curls had dried out tremendously. A friend of mine had the same results although it was more noticeable for her 4b hair. Kudos to Mixed Chicks for making this product vegan friendly, but that doesn&#x27;t quite rule out the fact that it still contains a whole lot of parabens as well as alcohol, which are both very damaging to all types of hair, especially curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, use the leave-in conditioner at YOUR OWN RISK! On the contrary, the shampoo and deep conditioner are quite delightful leaving your hair looking/ feeling full and frizz-free with the help of some shine.</li>
    <li> My 4-year old has lots of very curly hair.  After her bath at night, I finger comb this generously through her hair and then she sleeps on it.  She wakes up with gorgeous, soft ringlets.  I&#x27;ve tried less expensive leave in conditioners but none do the trick as well as this one.</li>
    <li> I liked the MC leave-in conditioner.  It made my hair soft, silky, and shiny.  I have soft waves in my hair and  would recommend this product for anyone with the same texture.</li>
    <li> Very good product for those curl hair girls  :)</li>
    <li> works great, but a little too much weighs down your hair.</li>
    <li> I started buying Mixed Chicks last year - I had heard about it for years but was always hesitant to spend the money if it didn&#x27;t work. I started out with the leave-in conditioner....It absolutely works. I loved how healthy my curls looked almost right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few months of good results I decided to go ahead and use the shampoo too. I don&#x27;t know what happened. After less than a bottle, my hair is suddenly more dry than it was before I started using it. It&#x27;s actually frizzy and the curls are much less defined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine what would cause this to happen and even bought the shampoo again just in case I was having a weird hair month. Same issue. I live in Los Angeles so we don&#x27;t really have humidity problems, I&#x27;m half black/half white, nothing about my diet has changed except maybe I&#x27;m being better about drinking water and I only wash my hair like 2-3 times a week. I will be looking into the ingredients but I&#x27;ve heard there&#x27;s a possibility for too much protein. If your hair is sensitive to that, just be careful when combining the two I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I most likely will not buy the shampoo again, but the conditioner &#x3D; amazing.</li>
    <li> For an asian with spiral curly hair, this product definitely works for me.  I use it right after I shampoo &amp; condition my hair, it seems to control any humidity factors that affect my curly hair.  I will definitely try the other products they offer.</li>
    <li> This was ok worked some but had to use large quanitynfor how expensive this stuff us and considering target sells it cheaper</li>
    <li> I have wavy and frizzy hair. This product works like mouse except its better for my hair. Only negative thing is that I have to apply a lot of it on to get rid of all the frizz but the look is great. Oh and my hair has to be wet not damp when applying because it&#x27;ll frizz up later on in the day.</li>
    <li> I can finally maintain moisture in my daughters uber curly hair!</li>
    <li> Works great! Used it on my hair extensions.. The only leave in I will be using from now..can&#x27;t wait to use it on my natural hair for the summer!</li>
    <li> I am of Jewish heritage and have extremely curly. This product is great and makes my hair look and feel soft. It brings down the frizz and I just bought some for my mom.</li>
    <li> I have extremely curly hair that tends to run really dry. This is one of the only products I&#x27;ve found that manages the curls well (shapes them together they&#x27;re not just frizzy looking and tangling easily) and also leaves it soft to touch - not crunchy or greasy or otherwise weird feeling. I will say the first time I tried it was when a hair stylist put it on after cutting my hair and it did feel a little crunchy before I got home, re-wet it and brushed it through while it was still wet. Now I use it every day and I always put it in, then brush it through while still wet and its always soft when it dries. Also, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 100% white but was told by my stylist that I needed to use this product to keep my \\&quot;fly aways\\&quot; under control. I love this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, blond hair that loves to curl up and fly away on humid days. This product kicks butt!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough about it. Keep up the good work, Chicks!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is a decent product as long as you know what to expect.  For one, I don&#x27;t know why they call this a leave in conditioner, because it&#x27;s not.  It&#x27;s more like a hair styling cream because it definately doesn&#x27;t condition your hair.  When it dries it makes your hair moderately crunchy, and sometime leaves flakes as well(no I am not mistaken, it&#x27;s not dandruff, it only happens when I use this).  Not to mention if you take a look at the ingredients you will notice that mostly everything they put in there acts as a hair styler.  There is nothing wrong with that of course, but they should not be giving it the name \\&quot;leave in conditer\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s rather annoying after a good shampoo and conditioning to apply this, only for your hair to harden up again.  I would have given this product 4 stars if it was labeled mixed chicks hair cream or something like that, but to label it as a leave in conditioner is just unacceptable.  Now, on the plus side if you don&#x27;t mind that, then you will probably like this product.  If you are the \\&quot;gel and go\\&quot; type then this might be for you.  Now, if you are the type to actually want to apply a good leave in conditioner and for your hair to look and feel great then I would recommend beauty without cruelty leave in conditioner.  It&#x27;s cheaper than mixed chicks and actually condtions your hair, and not just styles it.  Actually, I would recommend their whole hair care line.  Their shampoo, conditioner, and leave in.  Oh, and when you apply the beauty without cruelty leave in you don&#x27;t need to apply much like you have to with the mixed chicks so the bottle lasts longer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not not mixed, but this leave-in works wonders for my hair.  I do not really know my hair type because it has characteristics of many from the 3s to the 4s, like 3c to 4b.  Who know, who cares.  Anyway, I apply a half dollar amount to soaking wet hair that is divided into four sections and then two half dollars of Eco Styler to those same sections.  Takes about 15-20 minutes and then I let it air dry.  When it&#x27;s dry, I flip and scrunch.  Coworkers have comments on the shine, bounce, and definition.</li>
    <li> My toddler-aged son is half-black and half-white.  I tried multiple products to try and moisturize his dry hair, but they just made it frizzy and oily.  Even though it was well-moisturized, his curls lacked definition.  I figured I would give \\&quot;Mixed Chicks\\&quot; a shot since it is formulated for biracial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m VERY pleased!  I spritzed his hair with a spray bottle full of water and used my fingers to comb about a quarter-sized dollop of conditioner through his hair.  I saw curls forming as it dried! When it did dry, they were so well-defined they looked like bedsprings!  And it turned out so soft and fluffy.  It&#x27;s more than I could have hoped for.  The smell is nice, too.  People stop me when I&#x27;m out to comment on his hair and ask what I put in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m black and I keep my hair in an afro.  I use the conditioner, too.  It keeps my hair moisturized without making it oily and I get some curl definition, too...it&#x27;s not nearly as amazing as my son&#x27;s, though!  At first I thought the price is a little steep, but it&#x27;s absolutely worth it.  Now I only need one product to tame my son&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> Reeeeeeeeeeally like this product. I have sort of oily hair so I was afraid this would be too oily for it but it was perfect. Leaves my hair feeling really soft and with really nice curls.</li>
    <li> Great on my hair, doesnt feel greasy like other products I&#x27;ve tried.  I love how it made my curls more defined and not so wavy looking.  I love it so much I purchased the shampoo to go along with it for max results!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair so this is just what I needed!! It doesn&#x27;t take much to use. I love the results. My hair is soft and manageable!!</li>
    <li> Seems to dry hair out</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through so many hair products it&#x27;s ridiculous.  I have thick curly, frizzy, unruly hair that I love when I find the right product to tame it.  This stuff is somewhat pricey but I splurge on it because it&#x27;s worth it.  It&#x27;s a leave in conditioner that works as if it&#x27;s a gel too, it&#x27;s not stick at all and keeps my curls in nice tight spirals like I like it, not frizzy and messy looking.  I use this after washing with a little gel and some Argon oil and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
    <li> You pay for that soft curl and hold when you use this stuff, but it&#x27;s worth it, except you need to add another product to get shine.</li>
    <li> I am the proud mother of an absolutely beautiful mixed race 8 year old little girl( African American, Spanish, Scottish, Italian)  Her hair was always so cute when she was little...but as she got older, it became more and more unmanageable. More than anything, it had become so insanely frizzy!!! It got to the poInt that I was pulling her hair back into a slick pony tail with a ton of random products slathered in just to keep it under control. Regardless of what i would do,  she would still come home from school looking like she had stuck her hair in an electric socket. What was worse is that she was starting to notice and becoming embarrassed about her hair. I purchased this product based on some reviews that I had read online. Let me just say, FINALLY!!! I put just a small amount in her wet hair and by the end of the day she still has soft beautiful frizz free hair! What&#x27;s even better Is that she is wearing her hair down again for the first time in I don&#x27;t know how long. I can&#x27;t say enough good about this product. A little pricy, but well worth it!!!</li>
    <li> My sister says she loves it for her super curly hair. So nice that it was available on amazon!</li>
    <li> I purchased this based on reviews and yes, my curls are more defined and lovely. But there&#x27;s definitely this hard, firm, almost like holding gel-like feel to my hair. I am used to light, fluffy, residue free hair so I am a bit disappointed. Since this product was a bit pricey, I will certainly be finishing it, but I won&#x27;t likely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel nice an shiny an gives the curls a lil bounce. It leaves hair with a little hard coating but the curls last longer.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite product. Flakes on me and not as moisturizing as i would like. I dont think the price is worth it.</li>
    <li> it made my natural hair feel brittle and dry.</li>
    <li> I have 2c/3a curl pattern. I have to say I LOVE this product. I was like many, trying to find perfection. For me, this is it!  I use this along with gel and diffuse my hair. Best curls I have ever had. Please keep in mind, the quantity you need to use is different for everyone. I also have to apply it with my hair soaking wet. I have recommended it to others and will continue to do so. It works!  ♡</li>
    <li> Too much residue with this.  It is not light and it weighs hair down.  Also they is a sticker firmly affixed to the bottle over the ingredients.  I think the wax in it plus whatever else is in it must make it too heavy.</li>
    <li> My husband and child have naturally curly hair and use this product a few times a week. It leaves their hair soft, moisturized and manageable. You do not have to be considered &amp;#34;mixed&amp;#34; to use this product. Our family identifies as black.</li>
    <li> This did not work for me. It weighed my hair down, made it feel greasy.  I&#x27;ll keep looking for something else</li>
    <li> It is highly recommended and I have good luck with it!!!!</li>
    <li> Men of color, if you want a product that makes tightly curled [short or long] hair look well-groomed, managed with style, try Mixed Chicks, you won&#x27;t be sorry. I&#x27;m a Black-male, and I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now [recommend by my Mixed Chick] -no-pun intended, and it works brilliantly. I had an issue with dry scalp, wirily, out-of-place, look a mess, type hair, plus I have a sensitive scalp, with ingrown hair irritations. The product answered all those concerns. I use it after showering [because the hair gets damp], and after washing my hair a couple of times a week. During drying process, a few brush-strokes and combing not only makes my hair soft and easy to work with, a pat-down afterwards puts it all in place. It works for me, and I highly recommend the product wholeheartedly. Yes, it&#x27;s FIVE STARS</li>
    <li> Soft ends hair nicely.</li>
    <li> Heard a lot of YouTube naturalistas talk about this products, so I decided to give it a try. Besides the fact that a little 10 oz bottle costs $15, it also is not that great smelling. I tried it, it made my hair crunchy and sticky. Hated it, so I gave it to my cousin. Never again.</li>
    <li> It is a little too heavy for my hair!</li>
    <li> The reason I gave it only three stars , is because it contains not only one but 4 paraben list.... I don&#x27;t like that because when I use leave in conditioner , I would let it stay for 3 -4 days . My hair is 3b-3c</li>
    <li> I am a mom of a biracial child with frizzy/curly thick hair. She has multiple curl patters. Using this helps detangle her hair, but the next day her hair is really dry. Mixed Chicks leave in works a lot better for us when we mix it with olive oil. I may purchase this again. Kinky Curly has worked a lot better for us in terms of detangling and moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love, this product. My hair is shiny and my curls are well defined. I have found nothing else that works this well.</li>
    <li> ive been using this leave in conditioner for a couple years now and i have no problems.  It leaves my hair super fluffy and soft.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this purchase. This product came as advertised, no complaints. It is perfect for naturally curly hair!</li>
    <li> Great products. Amazon is always on time and great savings.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without it. My hair is addicted to this stuff, I have fine curly hair and I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 2 years I can&#x27;t remember life before it! Yes I know it sounds like I&#x27;ve been smoking the stuff but I really do need my mixed chicks leave in! It keeps my hair so soft and manageable. I haven&#x27;t tried any other leave in since I started using this.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love mixed chicks products because they work wonderfully for my hair in getting my curls defined.</li>
    <li> Love this produced! It makes my hair soft and easy to work with. Just don&#x27;t use too much other wise your hair will get hard.</li>
    <li> I tried this for my grandson&#x27;s hair.  It doesn&#x27;t take care of tangles and actually leaves his hair rather brittle.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping this would be the product that would really solve my problems with frizz and help to define my curls. Well unfortunately that did not happen.  I used the shampoo, conditioner, and leave-in and they were all very disappointing.  The shampoo didn&#x27;t feel like it really cleaned my hair.  The conditioner left my hair feeling sticky.  The leave in has an awful chemically smell and I actually had parts of my hair become straighter than normal.  The system didn&#x27;t help with frizz control or shrinkage. I wish this had been all it was cracked up to be but it&#x27;s really not.</li>
