<li> Those, to me, make a product look bogus and it&#x27;s hard to find a skin cream which doesnt have all those fake reviews.</li>
<li> I hate sticky serums and this one definitely isnt!  </li>
<li> You wont be disappointed in this product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Package arrived nicely... good value for the price</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t express how much I love these sleeping masks. Right after I received this I bought the hyaluronic acid sleeping mask and they have become a daily thing for me. I don&#x27;t know which one I like more</li>
    <li> I wake up and skin is still moist</li>
    <li> For the price this sleeping pack is really good. It goes on nicely and doesn&#x27;t feel gross or leave residue on my pillow. I wake up with soft skin and it doesn&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
    <li> I call this my Botox in a bottle and I sure have a reason to! It covers my face with a thin film and leaves it soft and supple for the next day. Really love this pack. ;) !!SOAPERS BEWARE!! This IS NOT to be used in shower jellies and bath fizzles.</li>
    <li> This is a great sleeping pack! Even though it&#x27;s a gel it has a nice consistency and keeps skin moisturized. I also noticed that within a few days  of using it some of my acne scars have faded and my smile lines are starting to go away. Another thing that I would like to add is that it is light enough to wear under your makeup!!!</li>
    <li> Its ok. I have used this product a few times and it has made my skin feel a little bit softer but other than that I haven&#x27;t really noticed a big difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this, i love the packaging also. i got this two days ago and my acne is going away already. It leaves my face feeling soft and vibrant, and i like how the instructions are in english also. will be buying again and from this seller.</li>
    <li> My skin is so soft now that ive been using this! I use a very tiny amount every bight, it does not bother my skin and my acne is actually clearing up a bit with this.</li>
    <li> Like it. Love the way my face looking moist and glowy</li>
    <li> love it give it a try it WILL help</li>
    <li> Love it!  Used first night in place of regular face and eye cream.  It goes on very slick gel like aloe vera and dried a bit but was still a bit moist.  In the morning, my face was noticeably plumber rosy with smaller pores.  No smell or nasty toxicity experienced and I&#x27;m super sensitive.  At this price, it&#x27;s worth a try for anyone looking for the noted improvements.</li>
    <li> does not help my Sikkim at all,  Can&#x27;t even use it overnight.  Have to wash.  It&#x27;s so sticky</li>
    <li> I love this product, my skin feel so smooth , my product came early and the instructions are in english.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, easy to use, and it really works leaving skin smooth &amp; moisturized.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin dry and I did not see any change and I returned it</li>
    <li> Great product and awesome seller</li>
    <li> Definitely keeps your face moist throughout the night! I love it. I apply it after the vitamin c serum! The texture of my skin has been so nice and plump.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to: provide some nourishment and moisture during the night, locking it in. I used it last night for the first time, and I was quite pleased with how my skin looked this morning: plump, soft, fresh and even. No break-outs, no grease on my face. Pretty awesome. I would assume it&#x27;s not life changing after just couple uses, but with prolonged and sustained use, I can see that it&#x27;s gonna keep my skin plenty hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a clear gel, and goes a tiny bit sticky on the face, but it absorbs almost completely during the night - I only splashed some cold water in the morning and I was good to go.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good, reliable and quite inexpensive product ( I can afford to use a lot, I put it on my neck as well).&lt;br /&gt;Way better than going to bed with nothing on the face, or, God forbid, some greasy night cream that makes u break out by morning (eek!)</li>
    <li> Five stars for good result after use, thoughtful package and a lovely note that comes with the package.</li>
    <li> I rarely leave anything a glowing review but I wanted to comment on this product.  It really does feel nice, makes skin soft, and dries quickly without ANY sticky residue, honestly! I hate sticky serums and this one definitely isnt!  It comes in a large bottle and it makes the skin so soft and nice, it is absolutely worth the price and is a quality product.  I was sorely disappointed in a product I ordered around the same time as this which was much more expensive.  I loved this one so much I ordered the hyaluronic acid version of this same product.  It genuinely is nice and deserves all the glowing reviews.  I also appreciate the company doesnt have a bunch of paid reviews or people who are leaving a review in exchange for free product.  Those, to me, make a product look bogus and it&#x27;s hard to find a skin cream which doesnt have all those fake reviews. The product arrived sooner than expected too.  I used it on my mom and she felt it was nice too, it made her skin feel tighter and softer.  You wont be disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> I love this mask. Wow I use this with my derma roller and cream. I have had Amazing results. Fine lines around mouth gone!! I look at least 10 years younger. I am so impressed. Now I do use this in conjunction with glycolic acid peel and lactic acid peel. When I wake up in the morning after using this 4 times a week my skin is soft and just glows. I will never be without it. Also I use it around my lips it says not to but I do...not on but around and I get a beautiful plump to my lip. I do have full lips but this magic mask gives me an actual plump. The same with my eyes. I get a plumping affect which makes my eyes smooth. I will never be without this ever!!! It is a part of my beauty routine now forever. It is made in Japan but has directions in English. Asian women have such beautiful skin well now I know some of their secrets.Thank you for helping us American women. Very very happy</li>
