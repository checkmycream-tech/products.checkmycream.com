    <li> Smells great ... moisturizes great, too.</li>
    <li> This is the best product. The smell is wonderful.</li>
    <li> This product is great but I was shipped the wrong size (7oz) and not the 14 oz that I ordered. The time required to receive the item ordered was approximately five weeks and involved the return of the incorrectly shipped item. The problem was successfully corrected by the seller but the result was an inconvenient shopping experience. Although  I would purchase this product again , I would be reluctant to purchase it from this seller.</li>
    <li> The Body Shop is by far the best body butter I have tried.  Keeps your skin moist with a beautiful glow.  I love the option of the bigger tub.  A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion of all time!!! Have been using for 10+ years!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite. Love it better than any lotion and the smell is pleasant but mild. My husband doesn&#x27;t like flowery overpowering smells, this he doesn&#x27;t complain about. It goes on so smooth and easy too!</li>
    <li> This is the GOOD STUFF.  It hydrates my skin and keeps it hydrated. I go through this stuff quickly because I use it all over my body. The coconut scent is not at all overpowering, just nice smelling!</li>
    <li> Wonderful body butter.  Love the smell and the texture.  I use it every night after a shower.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this lotion. The consistency is heavenly and so so wonderful in the winter. You can pretend it&#x27;s summer with the great scent while you moisturize your winter worn skin.</li>
    <li> Ounce per ounce compared to other body lotions, butters, moisturizers, etc., The Body Shop Body Butter is worth every penny.  It is thick, rich, creamy and ultra-moisturizing.  My skin feels like silk after this soaks in.  It has just enough scent, too, not the nauseating amount some products have.  I can&#x27;t recommend this body butter highly enough!  It works, and that is not something a lot of products can claim.</li>
    <li> I really like how this stuff works. It fights against dry skin in the winter time and does a great job at soaking in fast and isn&#x27;t too greasy. This stuff is heavy though, so this size tub if you are just using it for hands/feet or something will last you a while. Being a guy, the coconut smell is a little off-putting. I bought this for the healing effects of coconut oil on the skin, so I can deal with the smell just fine. Its not too powerful, but definitely noticeable.</li>
    <li> My mother loves this fragrance!!</li>
    <li> Girlfriend LOVES it! I just ordered more!!</li>
    <li> I ordered the jumbo body butter... Only to find the container was almost completely cracked along the bottom. Definitely disappointed.</li>
    <li> Item came as expected.  Good for all day use and no dry skin at the end of the day.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> The best- there is NO lotion like this</li>
    <li> Great for when you are pregnant!</li>
    <li> I love this product I needed one that would be good for strech marks have been using it for a while now and my strech marks are gone! Love it!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely the best. I have lots of allergies and this is one product that didn&#x27;t bother me..</li>
    <li> I love Body Butter, but Coconut is my absolute favorite. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the coconut oil, but it seems much creamier than others that I&#x27;ve tried. And the aroma is delicious without you smelling like a fruit salad. I have it in the HUGE, medium and the small travel size.</li>
    <li> As always the best body butter!</li>
