<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s awesome..  I tied a piece of rope to it to hang from the shower head. Every mirror fogs up, I take a little soap and smear a thin layer on it.. that will prevent it from fogging up.  5 stars.</li>
    <li> The mirror is smaller than I thought.  I misread the description and thought this was the deluxe model.  The mirror is big enough to get the job done though.  I don&#x27;t find that it is as fog free as claimed, even after holding it under the water.</li>
    <li> It Fogg up before I got to take a shower</li>
    <li> I bought this in May 2012 and still use it almost daily.&lt;br /&gt;I must have dropped it 100 times and it&#x27;s still scratch free. The hook sticks so well, that I had to leave it at my old apartment but getting a replacement at Home Depot is pretty cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The anti-fog thing really works. Just holding it under water for a few seconds gives me more than enough time to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, the best $10 you will ever spend. Shaving in the shower saves so much cleaning time and i don&#x27;t get yelled at for leaving little hairs all over the sink.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s smaller than I expected.. really small! But nice product, as described.</li>
    <li> My teens are slow in the shower so this fog free mirror helps them shave while in the shower.  Shaving in the shower is a time saver and helps keep the hair off the bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> Yeah, it works, but you have to run water on it first to keep it from fogging up. Nobody has time for that and you should advertise that.</li>
    <li> It works and easy to install</li>
    <li> Bought this mirror 2 and 1/2 years ago.  Use it 2-3 times per week.  Simply the best.  Before discovering the Shave Well, had bought one from Sharper Image for $75 and it never worked really well,  always fogging up and such.  Read the directions for use and maintenance and you&#x27;ll never be let down by this product. Now apparently they make a larger version.  Will be purchasing very soon.</li>
    <li> I bought the larger size for my shower at home. Follow the simple directions and it absolutely works! I recently purchased this smaller size for when I travel again. I definitely recommend this fog free mirror.</li>
    <li> The mirror is the perfect size.  The shipping was great.  The seller is great.  But my mirror always fogs and I dont know why!  Im still happy with my purchase.  I can now shave in the shower rather than over a sink!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty straight forward.  It&#x27;s nothing special like using hot water or anything like that.  Just heat it up under the water and you&#x27;re good for a shave.</li>
    <li> Just something very simple to use. Make sure you follow directions and put it in an optimal spot. I usually take it into the shower and then after I am done I dry it and put it in a safe spot in bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After shaving in the shower, you will never want to shave any other way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Shave WELL...GEET....GEET</li>
    <li> Having this mirror allows you to shave in the shower thus saving time in getting ready for work.  Wish I had purchased a long time ago!</li>
    <li> Gosh...I really like this mirror.  It is the perfect size to hold in my hand.  I just pull it down from its hook, run it under water, shave with it in my hand, and after my shower is done, I dry it with the towel before I hang it back up (no water spots to deal with that way).  It just works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just don&#x27;t understand some of these negative reviews.  One guy said it was \\&quot;too expensive for just a plastic mirror with a hole\\&quot;.  Um...it is like nine bucks, and has a convenient hook system that comes with it.  Sure, you can probably buy a plastic mirror for $3.97 at your local crap-mart, and it will be a piece of junk with no hook.  Is the extra $5 for this one really a burden??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another several reviews talked about water droplets.  HELLOOO?  We are shaving in the shower.  What magic mirror have you used that neither fogs nor gets water on it when immersed in water?  I can&#x27;t say that i&#x27;ve EVER had an issue with the water droplets, but for those that do, there&#x27;s this great product called Rain-X.  Maybe try that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer said his adhesive hook fell down.  Seriously?  You are gonna admit to everyone that you are either sloppy (ie didn&#x27;t clean the surface) or just a fool because you can&#x27;t make adhesive stick?  Have any of you EVER had those \\&quot;foam-style\\&quot; adhesives not stick...those things are like super glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is exactly what I wanted.  A simple, no frills plastic mirror with some type of mounting system...for cheap!  It just works. How does it get any better?  Oh, I can tell you.  It gets better because if you read those negative reviews, there&#x27;s obviously a real, live, human guy who owns the company and who cares about his product and true customer satisfaction (and he will attempt to contact you if you&#x27;ve had any problems).  Try getting that at crap-mart.</li>
    <li> Good for what is it.  It does fog up, but you rinse it with water to clear it. But it is not able to be relocated once you stick it up</li>
    <li> Easy to mount on wall and provides nice clear image for shaving.  Simple thing made well.  Will update re. durability esp. with outdoor use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;September 2012: a year on and it&#x27;s still in great shape.  Simple thing made well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;September 2013: still in good shape.  Have one in the bathroom shower and it&#x27;s doing fine as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the fog-free claim, well, not so much, but there really is no such thing, and its virtues make up for any shortcomings.</li>
    <li> Like most other reviewers here, I have been disappointed in the past with mirrors that claimed to be fog-free but that would only stay that way for a couple of weeks at best. On the other hand, I have been using this mirror almost two months and it is just as fog-free as when I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I dropped my review from five to four stars because after a while, the mirror got hazy and I was unable to restore it to its original clarity even with toothpaste. Still, for the price the mirror lasted about a year, maybe more, which is much longer than any other shaving mirror I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, the mirror does get fogged--however, unlike other shower mirrors, this one has a small slot cut out in its upper center portion that allows it to be hung on the included adhesive hook. When it does fog up, you simply remove it, run it under your shower water for a second or two, and place it back on the hook--and it&#x27;s good to go for 3-5 more minutes. I recently started shaving in the shower and I do 2-3 passes, and I&#x27;ve found that one rinse is good enough for an entire pass. So, a quick rinse between passes is all I need to get a babyface. This not only saves time, but cuts down on the razor irritation, nicks and cuts as well. This mirror is also ideal for washing your face. I use a facial cleanser in a tube and this mirror helps me get a nice even lather all over my face and keeps me from missing any spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hook included with the mirror is easy to install and it&#x27;s very sturdy--it has not budged since I put it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a small shower and/or stuff all over the place inside it, this mirror won&#x27;t cause too much crowding. I&#x27;m not sure offhand what the dimensions are, but it&#x27;s just big enough for my face and doesn&#x27;t take up much room at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer commented about water spots. They do accumulate over time, but the directions suggested cleaning them with toothpaste, which works like a champ. It made my spotted mirror look brand new again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and one other thing, just to echo other reviewers: there is a strip of plastic covering the mirror that needs to be removed before use. It&#x27;s a bit tricky to get a purchase on, and you might think you&#x27;re removing something that&#x27;s supposed to be there. Once you get a hold of it, though, it comes off pretty easily.</li>
    <li> It is wonderful.....it really works and it&#x27;s safe for my grandaughter when she visits, she loves it. My husband uses for shaving, said it really works well. I liked the price.AMAZON RULES if AMAZON DOESN&#x27;T HAVE IT YOU CAN&#x27;T BUY IT, THAT GOES FOR EVERYTHING I LOOK FOR</li>
    <li> Great little mirror! Works just as described. Make sure the protective coating is removed and hold it under the water for a few seconds and that&#x27;s it. I like that it&#x27;s acrylic, which makes it really light and safe if dropped.</li>
    <li> the mirror is very small, not much larger than a compact mirror.. it is fog free as long as you keep re-wetting it.</li>
    <li> Like several other reviews, I was kind of surprised at the small size (probably because I didn&#x27;t pay any attention to the dimensions in the product description), but upon climbing in the shower in order to decide where to mount the hook, I quickly discovered that it is just the right size for the task at hand (unless for some strange reason you like to stand 3 feet away when shaving)!  My shower is the type that is located in a tub enclosure, so after trying out a couple of placements I decided to mount it at the opposite end of the shower head.  This works out just great since all I have to do is make a 180 degree turn and I can shave without having the shower stream interfere with the view of my handsome mug!    I also really like the design of this item compared to all the competition.  It is total simplicity.  But after reading reviews on 6 or 7 other allegedly fog free mirrors I came to see that in this particular case simple is much more practical than complicated (and expensive).  As advertised, it stayed fog free after holding it under the shower stream for 3-4 seconds!    Lastly, I must mention the incredible customer service that this company offers with this product.  Shortly after ordering this item I received an e-mail from a representative of the company thanking me and telling me about the product, and how to get started by removing the protective cover.  Never in my life have I seen or heard of such amazing customer service, and certainly would not have expected in my wildest dreams to receive it from a $10 purchase!  Bravo and Kudos to the Cumberland Company!!  I wish they made more things because I would definitely buy from them!!!</li>
    <li> I had read other reviews about the size of the mirror. Not sure what others are talking about but the mirror size is perfect for the shower. I shave both my head and face in the shower and have no problems seeing my entire face and head when I shave. I also have had no fogging issues at all. Simply run the mirror under the water as directed and no fog! Many times I don&#x27;t even have to run water over it before I shave. I think this is a great product and would recommend it to anybody. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I really, really hate shaving. When I&#x27;m not out of town on business trips I won&#x27;t shave at all. I hate being scruffy and unshaven but I really hate standing there in the cold trying to shave too. Shower mirrors make this process much easier. Unlike other shower mirrors this does not attach to the water line, nor does it have an anti-fog coating (these generally start to peel off after a few uses). It becomes fog free by holding the mirror under hot water for a few seconds. This keeps the mirror fog-less long enough to shave. I think that this anti-fog method is likely the most effective, its also the least expensive.</li>
    <li> Great mirror, does it&#x27;s job nicely</li>
    <li> The mirror is indeed very small. But we got this for our 7 year old so he can see himself and check his hair as he is shampooing. (He tends to miss parts of his hair when he is shampooing.) The mirror is crystal clear and fogless. However, the only reason I give it 3 stars is because it does NOT stick to the wall. It comes with something similar to the 3M hooks, but it&#x27;s the dollar store kind and the hold on it is not good. If you want this to stick to the wall you will need to go buy a 3M hook. But I think it&#x27;s worth it, if this mirror is what you are looking for.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it.  The hook is really great and hasn&#x27;t fallen off the wall once.  While the mirror is small (4x6), he says it&#x27;s perfect. My husband is extremely picky and usually only likes/wants the best thing on the market. He is super happy with this product.  Honestly, for the money, I don&#x27;t think I could&#x27;ve done better.</li>
    <li> This is a very small mirror. I have not figured out if its a good or bad thing that it sticks with an adhesive rather then a suction cup. Although, with the suction cup you can remove it and change its place. But having said that its a lot easier to remove it from the adhesive hook to wash it.    But as far as fogging goes,It fogs up like every other mirror on the market. You have to throw water on it to defog.   Its not worth $9.99.   $4.99 maybe.   I gave it 3 stars because its better then nothing.</li>
    <li> Acrylic mirror with plastic hook plus adhesive strip.    You just hold it under the water to heat it up and it stays fog-free long enough to shave.  Not huge, but size is adequate for shaving.  NO EXTRA ADHESIVE STRIPS PROVIDED.  Will have to switch to a 3M command hook when I move.    Not a big deal, but it would have been nice to include an extra or two.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my very picky husband.  He regularly shaves in the shower, and likes having a mirror.  He&#x27;s bought several (many?) mirrors over the years - including at least one that cost close to $100.  None worked. I decided that, for the $10 this one cost, it was worth a try.  He (and I) were pleasantly surprised.  This one works well.  I did have to convince him to be patient enough to run it under the hot shower water for a few seconds, (maybe up to 10 seconds?)  so that it could become, and stay, fog free.  As they say, it works on basic science (fog is condensation and is drawn to cooler surfaces - warm it under the shower and no fog). While he initially wasn&#x27;t excited about that part, I was able to convince him that it was worth the (minimal) time - and certainly less time than he used to spend spraying things that didn&#x27;t work on mirrors in an attempt to restore coatings that didn&#x27;t work.  Several reviewers have commented on the small size.  My husband has a &#x27;less than small&#x27; face - and once he got used to the mirror size admitted it wasn&#x27;t an issue for him at all.  It adheres well to our ceramic tile shower.  Definitely recommend this mirror -</li>
    <li> Works as expected and well worth the Price.  Sometimes it has to be &#x27;heated up&#x27; twice to complete shaving.  What a hassle huh?!  Good product.</li>
    <li> Great customer service - they sent an email the day I received it with installation tips and to call them with any questions. No fog todate. Plan on taking it on vacation as it will pack easy. Wish they would include 2 hooks in case you make a mistake mounting the first or if another male needs one at a different height.</li>
    <li> I received my Shave Well mirror in great shape. Coincidentally, I also received an email from the company with very detailed instructions the very same day. The instructions were clear and detailed. I mounted the hook that came with the mirror and hung the mirror from it. Based on the other reviews I was a little concerned about the size but once I used it I realized that for me it was just fine.  I followed the instructions by running the shower water for a few seconds over the front and back, this brings the mirror to water temperature and enables it be become truly fog free. Sure enough, I shaved and the Shave Well mirror never fogged and as I stated earlier, the size was just fine. I am impressed with the clarity it provides and the fact that it does not fog and its economical price makes the Shave Well mirror the best shaving mirror I could buy.  I am more than satisfied with my purchase and am also very happy with the Shave Well customer service; the email that came the same day of delivery was very nice. I will definitely recommend the Shave Well mirror to others!</li>
    <li> Great little mirror... Came the next day along with a nice thank-you e-mail. Noticed some were surprised by the size, not sure why, the dimensions are clearly listed. Stays fog-free plenty long enough to shave unless your doing you entire body. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these fog free mirrors for shaving in the shower.  I followed instructions to hang the mirror then held the mirror under the hot water.  After doing so I hung it back up on the hook and voila!  Fog free!  The science behind why this mirror works is very simple and described in another review.  I will just say that it plain works.  Just make sure you hold it under the hot water to bring the temperature of the mirror up.  I hold it so the shower rains down on both sides for about 30 seconds each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the mirror up for a week and then my cleaning people yanked it off while scrubbing the shower.  I should have told them not to touch it.  Anyway the company contacted me and is going to send a replacement hook out.  First class customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone looking for an inexpensive fog free mirror that just works.  Simple and smart design.</li>
    <li> The \\&quot;Protective Coating\\&quot; was so adhesive and thin that I had to use a knife to remove it.  After finally figuring out what side was the back and what side was the front with coating (because it&#x27;s not labeled), of course it ended up that the front got scratched.  Literally a \\&quot;cookie cutter\\&quot; press job.  Going back to three dollar dual magnification mirror from Pharmacy.  Any mirror is fogless, so it&#x27;s not like this \\&quot;Shave Well\\&quot; has secret special qualities, except the adhesive!</li>
    <li> It really doesn&#x27;t fog! Just have to warm it up under water in the shower! Recommended for a simple shaving mirror!</li>
    <li> First, the mirror is terrific; it works just as advertised. Instructions were clear (\\&quot;hold in the hot shower stream for a few seconds\\&quot; being the most important one), and if you follow them, the mirror is indeed fogless. Installation is very simple, too.  Second, the customer service is OUTSTANDING. I made a stupid mistake hanging the hook, and emailed to ask if I could order another. The seller immediately put another hook into the mail and wrote me back within minutes.  I&#x27;ve tried several other supposedly fogless mirrors and found them too bulky, prone to falling down, and not very fogless. My new mirror is less expensive than those and works great.</li>
    <li> The mirror is great!  Once it reaches the water temperature, it stays fog free long enough to get a good shave.  Also, couple of days after receiving the mirror, got an email from the company asking  me if I was happy with the product.  Sent a reply, got one back from Bill Vogel same day.  Not a \\&quot;this email has been received, and will be processed in timely manner\\&quot;  Not a \\&quot;This is an unmonitored email from an account we created by typing random letters on our keyboard\\&quot;  But a real freaking reply.  Who does that? Awesome companies who want happy customers, that&#x27;s who!</li>
    <li> This mirror is a very good product you can get for only 10 bucks. It does steam up in the shower but all you need to do is to warm it up under hot water. The steam goes away and will not come back. It&#x27;s not made of glass so it&#x27;s very light so the chances are very low it will fall off the wall. However, if you&#x27;re looking for a large mirror this is not really suitable for you as it&#x27;s only a bit bigger than your hand, so make sure you check the size before you order it. I use my mirror when I shave in the shower and it works fine for me.</li>
    <li> I wanted a shave mirror, but did not to spend much money on one.  As other reviews mention, you have to \\&quot;warm it up\\&quot; in the stream of water.  I really like how it is removable though, as it makes it really simple to clean the shower.  It is very simple, and a little small, but suits my needs perfectly.  The customer service was top notch, as I received an email mentioning to contact them if I had any issues.  Customer service goes a long ways with me, and I feel confident that this product will last.</li>
    <li> The problem with this mirror is the ceramic tiles in my shower are cold enough to make this mirror fog up before I&#x27;m done shaving.  Holding it under the water is annoying because it comes out with tons of beads that are hard to see around.  I ended up using this thing a couple times and that&#x27;s it.  Back to getting out of the shower and shaving in front of the mirror where I can see what I&#x27;m doing.  I gave it a 2nd star because perhaps I&#x27;d think differently if I didn&#x27;t have a beard, and therefore would not have to worry about shaving the edge of my beard.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror to use in the shower. I needed something that would not fog up, so I bought this mirror followed the simple instructions and it works like a charm no fogging up when i shower Great price for the mirror and easy instalation</li>
    <li> I gave this mirror as a birthday gift to my husband.  I was hoping it would get him away from the bathroom sink in the mornings!  I was half right (C&#x27;mon honey I still have to brush my teeth!) as he carries it in his gym bag and shaves in the shower there (He holds it in his hand away from the stream of water).  He says it works great.</li>
    <li> the mirror works as described. i am very pleased with the performance of the fogless mirror because it makes shaving easier.  i now shave in the shower and its so much easier than before.  it is also light weight and made of plastic so it will travel well too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least four different brands of fogless mirror.&lt;br /&gt;This is the first one that works when used as directed.&lt;br /&gt;Just prior to shaving, you hold the mirror under the running water for about 5 seconds on each side, and it remains crystal clear for several minutes, long enough to shave.</li>
    <li> Mirror works perfectly, better then any of the other fog proof mirrors that I&#x27;ve tried in the past. Best of all, I had an issue with the hook(I hung it wrong like an idiot)! and received top notch customer service. Highly recommended for those who can only shave in the shower ilke me!</li>
    <li> It is cheap yet ingenious. Bought this because I wanted to save time by shaving in the shower and it works.</li>
    <li> This is a great product it works, just follow the instructions and you can&#x27;t mess it up. Great Design, doesn&#x27;t fog and it&#x27;s inexpensive . Buy it and save your self at least $20.00 dollars or more for a product that will not work as well. This is a must, if your looking for an anti fog mirror to use in the shower this is the one. I am completely satisfied. Great Product ! Renny G</li>
    <li> If you shave in front of your bathroom sink mirror, you are missing the boat. I hate shaving and thought that this might make it easier.....Wow what a difference!! The mirror works as described and I have no complaints at all. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best fogless shower mirror I have ever found. I&#x27;d highly recommend this to anyone who needs a shower mirror.</li>
    <li> This mirror does exactly what it says it will do.  It is fog free if you follow the directions which require acclimating the mirror to the temp of the water and the room.  The hook provided has a two sided adhesive that sticks well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror is smaller than  it appears in the advertisement but works for what it is designed to do.</li>
    <li> I have trouble with water beading on the mirror.  The FAQ suggests using toothpaste, which only helps for a use or two.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical because there&#x27;s not much to the mirror except a hook that lets you easily rinse off the mirror and hang it near the shower stream.  I&#x27;ve used multiple fog-free mirrors before that relied on coatings and they usually lasted a few weeks.  But, this mirror is great.  I rinse it off once before I start to shave and usually once halfway through.  I have two minor complaints.  First, is that the mirror is a tad small (it is clearly labeled as 4\\&quot; x 6\\&quot; in the Product Description).  Second, I placed the mirror close to the shower stream (as recommended).  But, this means I have to hurry and shave the side of my face towards the stream before the shaving cream is rinsed away.  Perhaps I could have placed it further away, but other reviews indicated that moving the mirror away from the stream increase the likelihood of fog.  Regardless, neither complaint is enough to downgrade my review from 5-start (especially given the low price).  I am very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Mirror works excellent in a hot shower a perfect shave.</li>
    <li> This mirror is great to hang in the shower, it fogs up slightly but this can be easily remied by running it under the shower water for a second and then placing it back on the hook. Very useful in shaving.</li>
    <li> used for a year, shows wear and tear on the backside. fogging is also an issue.</li>
    <li> It is not fog free at all</li>
    <li> This is a good mirror that works well and made of safe material. The price is perfectly reasonable and I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a substantial protective film on the mirror. You do must remove this film or you will not be able to see your reflection very well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s simple yet so useful.  I use this thing almost daily in the shower, whether shaving or applying face wash, it works great and stays fog free for my whole shower.</li>
    <li> My husband likes this mirror which is a great size and fog free when directions are followed.  It is easy to take off the hook and replace.  The hook has not fallen off the wall and appears to be very securely attached.  Besides being a good value, the seller provides fantastic customer service, far above what is often seen these days.  When this mirror arrived with a defect the seller quickly sent a replacement.  I am very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Great functional mirror. Simple enough to hold in hand or hang on hook. I find, however, that I need to spray the water on the mirror a few times rather than just the 2-3 seconds.  Also, the adhesive is not heavy duty, so I had to use other 3M brand heavy duty. But beyond this, the mirror itself is quick and easy, doesn&#x27;t take up too much space and is portable. I also use when I give myself a haircut.</li>
    <li> Setup multiple ones in the shower to be able to see the back of my head. Still fogs up somewhat but helps to run it under the shower water before using as that speeds up the warming process and lessens the steam fogging.</li>
    <li> Other reviewers have said this mirror seems small, but I compared it to another \\&quot;fog free\\&quot; mirror I bought about 10 years ago, and was about the same size.  The other mirror had some sort of coating which eventually wore off.  If you hold this one under the shower for a few seconds, it stays perfectly clear long enough to shave.  Nothing tricky, it just works.</li>
    <li> A little small, but still great visibility</li>
    <li> The mirror works perfectly and exactly as described. Best mirror for the shower to shave that I have ever used!</li>
    <li> I had a fancy fog-free mirror (from Sharper Image) that had water circulation behind the mirror. This was great for ~10 years, but then started to leak. While this was a good product, I did not feel like spend $100 to replace it. The Shave Well Mirror is a very simple, light-weight mirror and is doing the job for me very well. So far, I have not had the problem with the adhesion of the hook to my tile that some reviewers have noted. One big advantage of this mirror is that is portable. In the past, I always missed having a shower mirror when traveling. Now I can toss it in the carry on and go.</li>
    <li> This mirror works exactly as described, and never fogs up.  The communication from the company was great...they even sent instructions ahead of time on how to install and make the mirror work most effectively.  Great product all around!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B004VFXVJW The Shave Well Company a TRULY FOG FREE Shower Shave Mirror]]    Great bargan. Compact enough to travel with and it works. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> With just a touch of maintenance, it just keeps working.&lt;br /&gt;I have used one for at least a year, likely much longer; simply put, this is the best fog-free solution I have ever seen. The mirror I am currently using has outlasted three of any other type.  Seriously, there are at least 200,000 miles (or shaves) on this mirror! I have purchased at least four more as gifts. How does the saying go? &amp;#34;You won&#x27;t be disappointed.&amp;#34;  Cheers!</li>
    <li> I have tried lots of different fog-free mirrors through the years for shaving in the shower.  This mirror REALLY WORKS.  It stays absolutely FOG FREE for the entire shower and shave.  I especially like this mirror because it is not permanently attached to the wall (uses a small suction cup) and is also really great to take with you when you&#x27;re traveling.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror to use in the shower with my shower head water pick.  I use this on my teeth, but also to clean around my tonsils which are enlarged, so I need the mirror to see what I am doing.  It serves it&#x27;s purpose well.  I get it wet while I&#x27;m brushing my teeth &amp; then it&#x27;s fog free when I&#x27;m ready to use my water pick.  And you can hang it anywhere you want with the sticky hook which is great.  I don&#x27;t need it to stay fog free for as long as a guy probably would to shave, but as long as you let it warm up enough it seems to work fine, and a quick rinse if it fogs a bit is really easy as it is so light weight and on the handy hook.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This little mirror solved all my shaving needs. Since I shave in the shower, I&#x27;ve gone through countless mirrors and other high-priced gadgets looking for the right product. My long search has finally come to an end. This mirror is easy to clean (a little toothpaste) and rarely fogs (unless it takes you longer than 5 minutes to shave). Just hold it under water for a few seconds, hang it up on the hook (supplied with ultra-sticky adhesive) and start shaving. Great product, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror on a fluke.  I&#x27;ve been searching for an inexpensive, durable shower mirror for shaving for years.  The Shave Well mirror came up during another search and I immediatley added it to my Amazon order.  The mirror arrived a couple days later.  It&#x27;s simple to set up and is durable and small enough to use for travel.      I had one small problem with the mirror in that there was no indication that there was a plastic, protective film over the reflecting surface and I couldn&#x27;t feel one there when I checked.  An email to Shave Well resulted in an unexpected but very welcome response in a remarkably short period of time.  I received my response during the holiday evening, from Mr. Bill Vogel, who I believe is the company owner.  He very tactfully asked me about removing the plastic coating (without making me feel like an idiot) and offered to send me a free mirror for my trouble.      Too bad Shave Well doesn&#x27;t make more stuff!    The mirror is great and and is everything they advertise.  I&#x27;m buying more of them for family and friends!...</li>
    <li> The mirror definitely works as advertised. It&#x27;s no-fog because you take it off the hook and run hot water on it to warm it up. Once the mirror is warm, it won&#x27;t fog up. My only gripe is that the mirror is pretty small. It looks like a full size shave mirror in the photo, but it&#x27;s actually about half the size of other similar mirrors. Still, it&#x27;s large enough for me to see my big face in the shower while I&#x27;m shaving.</li>
    <li> So the mirror does fog up in the shower, if you follow the instructions and warm it up for a little bit it will stay fog free but only for a couple of minutes and then you have to do it again. The quality and design of the mirror is great and easy to use. Just wish it didn&#x27;t require warming it up every 1 to 2 minutes. I have had other fog free mirrors and the were no different from this one but they were not designed as well. The biggest advantage to this mirror is you can easily remove it to warm it up and hold it for shaving and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Like all fog free shower mirrors I have tried - it was completely unusable after a few months - can&#x27;t even be cleaned.  Maybe this lasted a little longer than normal, but it would be real nice to find one that I can keep using.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Mirror works as stated.&amp;#34; &amp;#34;I have been through several so called &amp;#34;fog free&amp;#34; mirrors and this is the only one that lives by that claim.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 11/17/15: Still going strong! Mirror is used daily in the shower. Just run it under hot water for 30 seconds and you&#x27;re good for 4-5 minutes fog free.</li>
    <li> Mirror works fine. Fogs up a bit too quickly for me (even with following the directions).    More annoyingly, after you buy the mirror, the Shave Well Company will spam you with emails that lack any \\&quot;unsubscribe\\&quot; link/instructions.  Mega-annoying, dudes.  Not cool.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s $10 and allows you to get a good, careful shave in the shower. Also, it is compact and lightweight enough for travel.     I recommend using a suction hook instead of the plastic stick-on hook provided with the mirror.     NB: The mirror is shipped w/ a protective film that is a bit tricky to remove. Just get one of the corners up and the film will peel off in one piece.</li>
    <li> Somehow I must have missed the dimensions of this product, but I thought it would be about the same size as all the other mirrors out there -- but it is not!  It&#x27;s \\&quot;wee\\&quot;!!!  It&#x27;s 4\\&quot; wide by 6\\&quot; long and has rounded corners so you won&#x27;t even get a full 4x6 picture.  The package says \\&quot;holds firmly in any shower\\&quot; -- well of course it won&#x27;t fall off the wall, it&#x27;s so LIGHTWEIGHT because, again, it is so SMALL.  We&#x27;ll see how it works, but I can&#x27;t see how #1 Son is going to think this is a good substitute for my nice big hand mirror in the shower - which is why I bought this for him, so I could get my own mirror back.  Hmm.  Interesting online, disappointing in person.</li>
    <li> This mirror makes shaving in the shower so much easier.  It is smaller than I thought, but it works better than I thought.  And the price is great too.  It is simple to install.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Intelligent efficient design with an incredible price and customer service too.  I Highly Recommend this to anyone sick of having their sink clog with shavings and lotion.  - james</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not big but it gets the job done. If you drop it it doesn&#x27;t break and there&#x27;s no \\&quot;filling up\\&quot; to deal with.</li>
    <li> I use this to shave my underarms in the shower. It didn&#x27;t fog up at all. There were a few tiny droplets on it, that&#x27;s all. I could see perfectly. I&#x27;m buying two more, one for travel ( I can hang it on a short bungee from the shower rod) and the other just to have a good lightweight mirror for seeing the back of my head in the bathroom mirror when fixing my hair. Great size, hard to find and the hole makes it perfect both for holding in your fingers and for hanging. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t fog up! And the icing on the cake is the supreme customer service, best I&#x27;ve ever had in the last eight years of ordering hundreds of things, even on a Sunday! Just make sure you peel it off on the side where the information label is. I was impatient and attacking the other side! I just wish other companies could take a lesson from him.</li>
    <li> Over the years I have tried all sorts of shower mirrors. They all just don&#x27;t last or work well. While they may be fog-less, they all seem to get this &amp;#34;grey film&amp;#34; on them and essentially become ineffective. I had resorted to buying a new one every few years and just thinking this is the best it can be. That is until I met this mirror. I read quite a few of the reviews about this mirror. I ordered it. The instructions and proper way to use it were abundantly clear. The secret is, just like the instructions say, getting the mirror warm under the shower water before using it. It really takes less than 30 seconds. Once you do it, the mirror remains completely clear of water and fog-free. Really, really works well.</li>
    <li> This fog free mirror is indeed fog free when used properly (which is easy to do).  I like the product.  The only issue I have had is that the gray coating (paint?) on the back has started flaking off after only a couple of months.  I did not do anything to cause this to happen that I know of...I only hung the mirror on the wall in the shower, used it according to directions, and that is all...no rough handling or cleaning, etc..  Anyway, I just called the Shave Well folks and they said that this problem has only been reported a very few times.  They are immediately shipping me a new mirror without hesitation.  Nice customer service!</li>
    <li> I got this mirror a week ago, but the hook was broken in the box. Instead of dealing with amazon returns and probably having to pay 6 bucks in shipping costs, I contacted the manufacteror through their website and after one email, they got my shipping information and sent me a band new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy from these people. Their product is good and they do right by their customers.</li>
    <li> Personally, I shave infront of the sink.  However, my Dad has shaved in the shower for as long as I can remember.  Because of this, he has received multiple \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirrors as gifts over the years.  Each one has been large, cumbersome, and definitely not fog free. None lasted long in the bathroom. This mirror actually does what its supposed to do if you follow the instructions.  Its not easy to get a product seal of approval from my Dad because he hates most things.  This mirror got the seal because its simple and functional. As a small business owner himself, he was also impressed by the customer service, when I told him I received additional instructions and a thanks for the purchase email from the company.  Its worth the price if you want a mirror that doesn&#x27;t fog up in the shower.</li>
    <li> This mirror is smaller than I anticipated.  I could have looked at the measurements but I didn&#x27;t and the image on the box lead me to believe it was bigger.  I recommend that you look at the measurements before buying this so you have a clear picture of what your are getting.  There really is no trick to the fog free component here.  You have to run it under the water for the mirror to warm up to the temp that the shower is.  Nothing fancy.  Works OK.</li>
    <li> Just got the mirror a few days ago. I was expecting something great based on the reviews, but I was left feeling a bit letdown. The mirror is not truly fogless (if there is even such a thing), so you need to rinse it prior to use and during use as well according to their water temperature specifications. If you don&#x27;t rinse it, it will fog up like any mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the quality, the reflective image is ok, but it feels like it&#x27;s from a dollar store or something. Also, the hook they include is plastic with a sticky back, so you basically have to affix that to your tile or wall. We actually have marble around the shower, and didn&#x27;t want to take the chance of ruining the finish by putting a permanent sticker on it. That can be a major pain to remove down the road or cause discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I wasn&#x27;t happy with the product, it&#x27;s pretty easy to return via Amazon. Also, their customer service guy contacted me and was really cool about ensuring satisfaction and standing behind his product. Top notch seller in that regard.</li>
    <li> Awesome mirror. Hold it under the water for 5-10 seconds and it stays fog free plenty long to shave. I had this one on a bendy arm for about 3 years that finally broke. It was great but kind of a pain turning the water on and off for it. This has an incredibly small footprint in the shower and it cheap too! I love it.</li>
    <li> This works exactly as advertised and it&#x27;s well worth the money. It IS truly fog free and if you want a budget-friendly alternative then you should try this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially made some remarks about the size being somewhat small for it to be completely comfortable, and the seller responded (apologetically) defending its choice of size. I think this is a definite plus for them. As they point out, it IS really easy to hold and it also makes it portable/travel friendly. That&#x27;s how I shave now (holding the mirror). On one hand, shaving in the shower is now really comfortable because I can clearly see where I am shaving. On the other, shaving in front of a big mirror gives me a greater field of vision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the net I give 5 stars because being able to clearly see where I am shaving makes shaving in the shower incredibly nice. About size, the seller additionally recommended an alternative product they make which is larger. I might try that one out later, but for now this product is more than enough for the job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a person who has to shave every day and I&#x27;m constantly searching for mirrors that won&#x27;t fog up, won&#x27;t fall off the shower wall, etc.  This mirror completely fit the bill, I warmed it under the water as the instructions suggested and it stayed completely fog free and clear for me to shave my entire face.  I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I bought the mirror because of the amazing reviews. I probably did not fasten it correctly to the wall so it was OPERATOR ERROR, but it fell off within 1 day. I didn&#x27;t feel as though it was very sturdy anyway with only being secured by the top, it swayed against the wall. I went to Target and bought their $12.99 fogless mirror that looks better AND has an attachment to hang a razor - very important to my fiance who I was buying it for. All-in-all, I don&#x27;t feel as though this was what was promised or the quality I expected. Again, most likely operator error on fastening it to the shower wall, but I am 100% more happy with the Target Fogless mirror that has 4 huge suction cups so if I secured it the wrong way the first time I can remove it and move it to a different part of the shower wall.</li>
    <li> As described, product met all expectations.  Quick shipping.</li>
    <li> When I recently switched to an electric razor, I quickly discovered that I got better shaves in the shower.  This means I needed a shower mirror.  I discovered the ShaveWell, and it works perfectly.  A simple hook with an adhesive backing attaches to the wall of the shower, and a lightweight mirror attaches to the hook.  It should take under a minute to mount the mirror.  The reason why the mirror uses a hook is that you are supposed to run the mirror under the hot water, to equalize the temperature and eliminate the fogging.  And it works exactly as promised.  It looks nice, too, and the price is very reasonable, so this is the perfect solution to shaving in the shower.</li>
    <li> It is important to remove the opaque plástic! After that, you&#x27;ll have a crystal clear reflection! Really great! Is also very cheap!</li>
    <li> I was looking to replace our Sharper Image shower mirror/radio, which didn&#x27;t last long enough to change the batteries, but kept it up in the shower for the mirror. I thought it would be easy to find a shower mirror in the non-internet marketplace. Wrong!  But Amazon to the rescue; one can literally find anything here. I bought this shower/mirror because of the price and free s/h.  I agree with others that it is a tad small, but the customer service I found with this company can not be beat.  This company  sent informative email after recieving product and even follow up with my satisfaction. All on a Ten dollar purchase!  I did have a small peeling of the reflective coating on back of the mirror,(not affecting the view) But since they asked I told them.  Within a week I had a replacement. You hardly see customer service like this, and if we did; this country would be better off.  Since I know the company probably reads all reviews, I just want to say, You are doing a Great Job, but you could make this mirror just a tad larger.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my fogless mirror for almost a year now. I didnt realize how much time it actually saved me untill I went without it for two months. For me it was two months too long! I guess people don&#x27;t realize how much time is saved when you put shaving and showering togeather. I&#x27;ll be stocking up on this item for value added Christmas Gifts!</li>
    <li> I had never heard of a fog free mirror before so I was ready to try it out. For $9.99, you cannot beat that price. It was very easy to setup. It comes with an adhesive hook that you just stick on the wall of your shower, and then you hang the mirror off of the hook. The mirror is very lightweight as well, so it is very secure as it hangs from its hook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part about it is that this mirror really is fog free! All you have to do is stick the mirror under the water when you first start your shower. Then it is ready to use. Since the mirror is lightweight and not huge, it is very easy to hold it in one hand as well. I was very impressed when I saw that this mirror does exactly what it says it does. I would highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> I have tried countless shower mirrors and this is the best one yet! This one really doesn&#x27;t fog and it is bigger than all of my others. My fiancé loves it! I bought it for him for Christmas and it was so inexpensive! It makes shaving in the shower so much easier!</li>
    <li> Ok so ... at first I wasn&#x27;t too thrilled with the mirror and actually wrote a review here reflecting my dissatisfaction.  But within about an hour, I received a nicely worded email from the manufacturer offering insight to exactly how the technology in the mirrors construction, makes it truly fogless.  We had it positioned in the shower too high on the wall (have kids so ... glass and water + kids &#x3D; not good).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve posted this info below but I gotta say .... any company that is that willing to stand behind their product and offer such personal customer service is a 100% winner in my book.  If only all online retailers could be this way.  It&#x27;s nice to know they care enough to respond personally.  Buy the mirror ... it&#x27;s affordable and does what it says.  Enjoy!  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the email I received .......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I may, please allow me the opportunity to share how the mirror works in an attempt to help alleviate the fogging issues you mentioned in your review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Most houses are kept in a temperature range of 70-75 degrees.&lt;br /&gt;  The average shower water temperature is 107.5 degrees.&lt;br /&gt;  Fog on a mirror is simply condensation. The air in the bathroom is heated by the shower and becomes saturated with moisture.&lt;br /&gt;  When this saturated moist hot air comes in contact with the shower shave mirror (which is still at normal room temperature roughly 30 degrees less), the moisture comes out of the air and condensates on the shower shave mirror surface.&lt;br /&gt;  When you hold you Shave Well mirror under the shower stream for a few seconds, the acrylic mirror will warm up allowing for the temperature of the moist air and the mirror itself to equalize.&lt;br /&gt;  Once you have held the mirror in the shower spray to equalize the temperature of you shower and the mirror, there can&#x27;t/won&#x27;t be any fog/condensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of that being said, the mirror works on basic science.  If your mirror is still fogging then the only answer I can give you is that it remains cooler than the temperature of the shower.  Since the mirror is rather thin acrylic, it should warm up in the few seconds you have been holding it in the warm water of the shower spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some additional thoughts that remain would be&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a.) Whether or not you have a greatly reduced flow shower head.  If you do, it may take longer for enough warm water to equalize the temperature of the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b.) If the mirror hung so high that there is a direct flow of cool air over the shower curtain/door or whether an air conditioning vent is blowing toward it.  If this is the case, I am happy to send you a new hook so that you can reposition the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;c.) One additional suggestion would be to make sure you are turning both the front and back of the mirror under the shower water spray when you are equalizing it.  This will help in \\&quot;warming it up\\&quot; to equalize the temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, regarding the issue of the size of the Shave Well mirror, it was designed to be removable from the wall to truly address the issue of fog by \\&quot;warming up\\&quot; the mirror under the shower. Given that the mirror will be removed from the hook before you shave, many users choose to hold the mirror while shaving. The 6\\&quot; X 4\\&quot; size fits well in a users hand as well as provides a complete reflection of the entire face while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To avoid any confusion, under the Product Description section of the amazon.com listing is the size of the item is shown: \\&quot;The Shave Well Company fog free shower shave mirror measures 4\\&quot; wide, 6\\&quot; tall and is 1/8\\&quot; thick. The base of the adhesive hook (the part that sticks to the wall) measures 1\\&quot; wide and 1 1/2\\&quot; tall.\\&quot;u is that it remains cooler than the temperature of the shower.

    <li> works well.  make sure you run it under the water for a few seconds to warm it up.  It is a little small, but for the price, it does the job</li>
    <li> I was quite disappointed as the size of the mirror is quite small. I ended up getting a larger mirror with 2X magnification for less than half the price.</li>
    <li> Reflective surface behind the mirror started to peel immediately and shortly thereafter the surface started to whiten.  Its not our water.... This is junk.</li>
    <li> I use this to shave every day and i love it. It has fallen more than a dozen times and it doesnt even have a scratch on it.</li>
    <li> The product is fine...basic, does what it says.    BUT I continue to get emails from the Cumberland Company after the order through Amazon Marketplace advertising other products, Christmas gift solicitations now - AND NO UNSUBSCRIBE OPTION.    I would have not purchased the mirror if I knew I was signing up for their company spam.  It&#x27;s only been a few emails, but that&#x27;s not acceptable to me.</li>
    <li> The concept is good, but the mirror is not fog-free in my shower. If I hold it so the shower is streaming over the back of the mirror, it is nearly fog free. Otherwise, it fogs up almost at once.</li>
    <li> good mirror for the shower, I would like to increase the face to be a better one but the quality is good</li>
    <li> 10/10 best costumer service in the usa, excelent vice president, took the time personaly to review the item and return new one</li>
    <li> This is a simply mirror that comes with one of those white hooks that you peel the back off of to hang. The mirror has a gray back-side which I assume is meant to be sensitive to temperature? The premise is good I suppose. Why do mirrors fog in the shower? Because they are cold and collect water vapor / steam and condensation. The idea is that this mirror heats up quickly by running it under the hot shower water? First problem: I don&#x27;t have an extra hand to hold the mirror under the hot water in the shower, because I&#x27;m using both hands to wash myself. So, my answer was to take the mirror off the hook and set it on the ground in the shower so the \\&quot;runoff\\&quot; water would heat it up. Second problem: If you get the mirror warmed up so it won&#x27;t collect steam / condensation, it only stays heated up for a very short time (not long enough for me to shave before it starts steaming over again). Third problem: if I set the mirror on the floor of the shower to heat up, it collects soap scum and such very quickly (due to being exposed to runoff water). My assessment: I wasted my money on this product and I should have either bought a better made mirror (perhaps with a suction cup to hang it so I can move where it&#x27;s hanging) and deal with the steam, or I should have bought one of the more expensive mirrors that use an actual source water source to heat up the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Initially I gave this product 1 star, but I have since changed it to 3 stars. As others have noted, this seller really believes in his product, and that counts for something. Also, I&#x27;m still using it after some time now, so it can&#x27;t be all THAT bad. I really think the problems I experienced are the particularly cold initial temperature in my shower. The science here isn&#x27;t revolutionary (warm up the mirror, less condensation), but the basics of it are sound. I just have to keep \\&quot;re-warming\\&quot; periodically while I shave.</li>
    <li> A fog free shower mirror that actually works! Granted, it will only stay fog free for 2-3 minutes before you have to hold it under the water for a few seconds again, but still... I only have to \\&quot;re-de-fog\\&quot; it once during my shave. It&#x27;s quite durable, as well. It&#x27;s not glass, but rather some kind of plastic. If you have a poorly lit shower, like me, I suggest getting one of those little waterproof, battery-operated tap lights, like [[ASIN:B0017KYDZA this]] one and putting on the shower wall directly under your mirror. Just make sure you check the dimensions of this mirror before you order and that you are satisfied with the size. I do think it could have been a bit larger, but I am still extremely pleased with it. So...    Pros:  Durable, Lightweight, Easy to Install, Easy to Clean, Actually Works, Affordable    Cons:   A Tad Small</li>
    <li> Bought this for all the good reviews. It works great and comes with a little holder I mounted on the shower wall. If you heat it up in the water, as instructed, it stays fog free long enough to shave. I wish I would have bought the larger one.</li>
    <li> Absolute elegance in its simplicity.  There is nothing about the device that can fail (repeatedly dropping it onto marble floors without any effect proves the point) and it performs better than solutions that cost exponentially more.  Travel perfected: throw mirror and a suction cup hook in your bag.  Done.  If you value ease of use, performance and value, Buy it.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed, and I&#x27;ve never written one of these things before either!</li>
    <li> Works well.  Stays fog free for quite a while, easy to setup. Would be nice if it came with a squeegee to clear the water for a better reflection.</li>
    <li> I was sceptical about this, but I  went ahead and purchsed it. I am glad I did. It works exactly as stated. I use it everyday.  I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> If you want a small, removable mirror to shave with this works great. A hook to shower wall with adhesive and is removable from the hook.  To defog, just hold mirror under water briefly.</li>
    <li> Not sure what everyone seems to be seeing in this product, but I&#x27;ve used shower mirrors for years and this might be the only one I&#x27;ve tossed.  Why?  Warming the mirror by holding it in the shower stream certainly keeps the fog off (for a minute or two, at least), but the water spots are only a slight improvement over the fog.  The whole surface is covered with water spots and they don&#x27;t go away.  Perhaps if you want to really work hard, you could warm it up, and then squeegee it.  Too much work for me.  If you&#x27;re expecting a clear reflection, think again.</li>
    <li> This is a basic mirror that is cheap.  That said, it still works OK considering what it is.  It can stay unfogged for at least a minute or two.</li>
    <li> I would have preferred a mirror that was fog free without requiring me to warm it under the water each time.  That said, it does work.  I hold it under the shower stream immediately before shaving to warm it up.  The fog free effect lasts for a few minutes -- enough time to shave.  I recommend being very careful and deliberate when attaching the hook to the wall.  It sticks quite strongly immediately.  There isn&#x27;t much of an opportunity to fix it once you adhere it.</li>
    <li> Title says it all.  I&#x27;ve used every type of shave mirror out there...this is the only one that worked.   Sometimes the simplest solution is the best one.    Remember to use the little piece of silicone adhesive that comes with it.   Most people probably discard it without thinking about it.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says. I&#x27;m very pleased and I would highly recommend it to others. Before you use it, just let the shower water run on each side of the mirror for a few seconds, and it stays very clear and fog-free for many minutes! The mirror is very light but also very hardy--I accidentally dropped it, but it stayed perfectly intact and without any cracks or scratches. After a month, the hook suddenly fell off, but it was probably my fault because I didn&#x27;t thoroughly clean the wall tile before I adhered the hook onto it. I contacted the product&#x27;s customer service with a request for a replacement hook, and Bill Vogel (Exec VP) responded within 24 hours, saying that he&#x27;ll immediately send a new hook, and he provided very helpful tips regarding how to properly clean the wall, and how to keep the mirror clear (e.g., to polish it with a little wd-40 so that water droplets don&#x27;t stick). I received the replacement hook just a few days after shipment at no cost to me, and Bill included our email correspondence. Overall, I love this product, and the customer service is the best I&#x27;ve ever experienced. Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> The mirror I received had a defect on it. I contacted the Shave Well Company and within minutes they responded back. They sent out new mirror and had it in two days. Satisfied customers are what they are all about.</li>
    <li> All my mirrors in the past worked well for a few months but finally became unusable due to fog issues.  When I first pulled this mirror from the package, I thought, \\&quot;oh man, I&#x27;ve been ripped off for $10.\\&quot;  It was light, and just seemed like a flimsy piece of cardboard.  Then I took off the mirror&#x27;s protective cover and gazed in wonder at the clearest mirror I&#x27;d ever seen.  A strange thing to say, yes, that a shaving mirror would almost take my breath away with its clarity but that&#x27;s what happened.  Used it this morning and it works exactly as advertised.  Because it has no \\&quot;protective anti-fog\\&quot; coatings to keep fog away, I don&#x27;t expect it ever to stop working.  Very, very pleased.</li>
    <li> Mirror works as stated ! Size is perfect,easy to clean when needed. I like the fact that it is portable as well. Recommended. Great customer service from the company.</li>
    <li> Effective, when you hold it under the water for a few seconds. It doesn&#x27;t fall off the wall in the middle of the night. All in all, I&#x27;m pretty pleased with the thing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve shaved in the shower all my life and have always found fogproof mirrors to be a myth.  They just dont work for very long.  This one really works.  Their logic is a bit different than most fog proof mirrors... instead of some coating on the mirror that keeps the fog off they advise the user to take the mirror off the hook and hold it under the stream of water for a few seconds before using it.  Their printed material even provides a grade school level explanation of where fog comes from and why this will work.      The other thing I found very impressive is the companies desire for customer satisfaction.  This is an inexpensive item but the company emailed me on 2 seperate occasions to confirm that I was completely satisfied.  The way they deal with customers I don&#x27;t think they are a very big company but they certainly are a company I would buy from again.    A lot to say about a small item but I remain very impressed with both the company and the mirror.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and it won&#x27;t break. It stays fogless and gives a clear image. The rest is up to you. A few people complained it&#x27;s small, but all you need to see is your face while shaving and this mirror allows you to do that, unless you have a gigantic pumpkin head, or look like Newt Gingrich. If you let the water run while shaving then you&#x27;re wasting quite a bit of water. I turn it off, shave and turn it back on.</li>
    <li> So since I bought this mirror to shave while taking shower this thing work great.  Very happy with the product, good price, and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Works great. Just warm it up and you&#x27;re good to go. Who needs shaving cream?</li>
    <li> This is one of those cases where low-tech works the best.  The mirror is light weight acrylic and will not break if dropped.  The mirror surface give a nice clear reflection.  The mirror is small, but large enough to shave with and need be no larger.  Finally, just hold it under the water for 5-10 seconds and it will be fog free for about 5 minutes.  I am so happy I didn&#x27;t spend a lot for the expensive battery powered LED clock, light up things that fail after a few months and fall  off the wall in the middle of the night.  The hook seems to adhere just fine to the tile, but because I really don&#x27;t need to hear something go bang in the night, I leave this mirror on a shelf in my shower and only hang it up when I need it.  I know this sounds like I have no life, but in a world of high-tech products that just fail you and frustrate you all the time...this little thing is a breath of fresh air.  I regret not having bought it years ago as I have learned that I love shaving in the shower.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving in the shower for what seems like at least a decade and seem to go through \\&quot;fog-free\\&quot; mirrors every year or two.  They just lose their \\&quot;fog-free\\&quot;ness, or get scratched up and never seem to last.  I&#x27;ve paid anywhere from $20-40 and they just never seem to last.  I found this product here on AMZN based on all of the positive customer reviews and could not be happier.  It&#x27;s easily cleanable, inexpensive, and so simple in design.  If I had a couple of suggestions to offer, it would be to add an inch or two more in width.  I also recommend using a removable suction cup type hook instead of the adhesive based one provided but I am glad they include one to get you started.  As if the product was not good enough on its own merit, this company&#x27;s service is super responsive when I had a question and they stand behind their product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Shave Well Company mirror for a few weeks now and really enjoy it. I was originally going to try ToiletTree&#x27;s mirror [[ASIN:B003BQ6QXK Fogless Shower Mirror with Squeegee by ToiletTree]] but decided at a 1/3rd of the price, I had to try this one first. I enjoy how light and mobile it is and it simply works as advertised. My only complaint would be that you have one shot to position the mirror where you want it with the adhesive hook. Had I not had a suction hook on hand like these [[ASIN:B002OJC1J8 Powerlock Suction Hooks]] I really would&#x27;ve been disappointed. With the suction hook, I was able to try a few different spots and really found that option useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 6/4/12: the Shave Well Company responded last week and explained they have a product that includes a suction hook and it should be in the Amazon store within the week. As I write this update a week later, the mirror with hook is in the store now [[ASIN:B0083VCV1O The Shave Well Company Fog Free Travel Mirror]]. The size of the travel mirror is identical to the original (and it&#x27;s only $8.99 v. $9.99 for the original). They also have another mirror that should be in the store shortly that is wider (5.25 inches v. 4). I enjoy my mirror enough that I&#x27;ll be purchasing a number of these as gifts.</li>
    <li> As a sophisticated gentleman, I enjoy shower shaves very much, especially when aided by quality products. Given as much, I note that The Shave Well Company&#x27;s \\&quot;TRULY FOG FREE Shower Shave Mirror\\&quot; is indeed all that and a bag of chips. Shave on Wayne... Shave on Garth.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this mirror. I gave it one starless at first because I felt the edges a little sharp. However the customer service send me how to fix the sharpness. It works now perfectly. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am delighted with my purchase--not only with the product but with the customer service as well!!  First of all, the product is EXACTLY what I was looking for. I shopped around in brick-and-mortar stores and couldn&#x27;t find what I wanted, and then searched on amazon. I nearly settled for one but then saw this product and honestly, the reason I decided to go with this one was because of the positive reviews about the product. And now, I&#x27;ll just chalk mine up as yet another 5-star review. It does everything perfectly, really is fog-free, and is extremely practical for use in the shower, as well. Very well designed. It won&#x27;t break when it falls and this is super useful and necessary in the shower.  Secondly, about the customer service, I contacted them shortly after delivery because I placed the hook in the wrong place and in the process, I ruined the adhesive on the back. I contacted them simply asking them where I could buy a new one and they surprised me by sending a new one free of charge! This definitely exceeded my expectations and I HIGHLY recommend them to anyone! Truly remarkable.</li>
    <li> Want to start by saying I love the mirror.  It works well stays fog free good enough to shave in the shower.  I may have to run it under the water 2 or 3 times tops to get a clean shave.  The only negative thing I would say about it is that once you run the mirror under the water, the water doesn&#x27;t bead up and run off leaving you with a bit of water spots on the surface.  This doesn&#x27;t really interfere with its functionality though.  Very good mirror for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I admit i was a bit surprised at the size of the thing when i got it.  I expected it to be bigger than what it is.  Pay special attention to the pictures with the shower tiles in the background to get a good idea of how big the mirror is.  Although it was much smaller than i anticipated, I still think this is a great value and is more than serviceable for in-shower shaving.</li>
    <li> This product is very good. When held under the water there is no fog whatsoever. It works as advertised and there are no issues thus far. If your looking for a good fog-less mirror for a great price, yo found it.</li>
    <li> The mirror may be small, but it works well and its all you need to shave your face in the shower.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d buy another and you might have to.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned this for about 3 years. The fog free&amp;#34;-ness seems to go away as time goes on.&lt;br /&gt;I expect to have to start buying one every 2-3 years to keep it up.</li>
    <li> This mirror is the perfect size and is more durable than most mirrors I&#x27;ve had. I&#x27;ve purchased numerous mirrors in the past, only to have them fall or drop in the shower and break. I&#x27;ve dropped this one multiple times and no damage at all.</li>
    <li> Gotta say this is a fog free mirror. Just run it under the warm water a few seconds and towel it off and fog free it is. Was kinda shocked at 1st how small it was. (just smaller then my old mirror) but once i used it, the size was perfect. The hook comes with that jelly sticky stuff and I took it off, but i think you may want to leave it on so when the mirror is on the hook it may keep it from swinging? My only concern is how it will clean up over time with the hard water build-up and cleaning. My son comes in and steals it from my shower it works so good. Looks like they are gonna get another sale from me.</li>
    <li> I used the mirror for the first time this morning. It never fogged up! I did not rinse it in shower water or do anything except look into it. It is crystal clear, and undistorted. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> It worked well for about a year, but there is a layer of thick gray paint on the back (presumably to protect the mirror coating) which is rotting off. If they had just chosen a more durable coating for the back, this would be a great product!</li>
    <li> This product simply works.  No bells and whistles, nothing to plug up or spray on. Its just a small mirror that retains heat, therefore doesnt fog.  I hold it with one hand and shave with the other and it has made my shaving in the morning remarkably smoother.  I have coarse facial hair, so razor bumps can be quite the issue, shaving in the shower with this product has drastically reduced nicks bumps after shaving. Moral of this rambling review is: buy it.  It delivers as promised.</li>
    <li> This item is great. Looks very modern, small, and easy to take for travels and keep in your personal shower at home. I followed all the instructions properly. When it doesn&#x27;t fog up it is amazing. Thing is it fogged up on me and it continues to do so after a minute or two while I&#x27;m shaving. I held it under the water for 2-3 seconds, sometimes even longer, but still will eventually fog up. Not bad.. it works for me; unfortunately, can&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it doesn&#x27;t stay fog free..</li>
    <li> Pro - As long as you follow the instructions (as in, warm up the &#x27;backside&#x27; of the mirror) it works like a champion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con - It is widdle biddy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro - The company is so pro-consumer, they email you just to make sure its working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con - The company emails you after you buy it to make sure you know how a mirror works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately - 5 out of 5 - would shave again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s simple in design and works well. The \\&quot;catch\\&quot; is that you have to run it under hot water, front and back, for 3 seconds or so. It will stay clear enough for me to shave before fogging up again (2-3 mins)but I don&#x27;t have a thick beard. also, it won&#x27;t fall off the wall like my last one.</li>
    <li> quick ship&lt;br /&gt; good price&lt;br /&gt;product works very well&lt;br /&gt;have tried number of mirrors in the shower, this is by var the best</li>
    <li> Color me impressed. I have tried shaving mirrors in the past and none of them had worked, despite my high hopes. This one was such a bargain I figured \\&quot;why not?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;And it works. Perfectly. All you have to do is follow the incredibly simple directions: hold the mirror under the stream of your shower or spigot and allow it to get acclimated to the temperature on each side, then hang it up on the provided hook and shave.&lt;br /&gt;Bravo to the manufacturer for getting right what so many others have attempted and failed.</li>
    <li> This mirror is truly fog free and will last about 6 minutes but is easily re-warmed by the hot water from the shower head. My complaint is that it is very small, it&#x27;s only about double the size of a credit card. It is die cut plastic and looks very cheap. The edges are not beveled or even properly smoothed or deburred. Good idea, poor execution.&lt;br /&gt;Note! After leaving this review I received two emails and then a letter from the VP of the company. They are very concerned about any negative comments and willing to do just about anything to make it right. I have to admit that my complaint about the size of the mirror is my fault, they listed the dimensions correctly but I just glossed over them. They sent a replacement at no charge even though I didn&#x27;t ask for one. Unusually good customer service, well done.&lt;br /&gt;Aptos Ca.&lt;br /&gt;Mike</li>
    <li> I researched fogless shower mirrors a fair bit before purchasing this one.  The basic reason for fog, as one quickly finds out, is condensation due to temperature difference.  There are thus a few different ways of solving the problem.  One is for the mirror to be electrically heated.  Another is a hot water bank behind the mirror.  Another is a special coating on the mirror to attempt to slow temperature changes and condensation.  This mirror uses the simplest method possible, namely it hangs on a hook and you take it off and run it under the hot water.  I believe it is very effective.  Some people comment on its size.  That has never been a problem for me.  In fact, because it&#x27;s small enough, I would even consider bringing it on trips with me so I can shave in hotel showers.</li>
    <li> I used the Shave Well Company Truly Fog Free Shower Shave Mirror for the first time today. Once the protective coating is removed, the mirror is crystal clear. I think the size is just right, at least for me, and it is easy to securely grip the mirror due to the soft, rubber-like backing. While it didn&#x27;t stay fog-free for the entire shower, it was easy to hold it under hot water for a few seconds just before I was ready to shave and it stayed fog-free for the shave. I&#x27;m pleased that I purchased this mirror and anticipate many years of usage.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend because he likes to shave in the shower. I had bought a fancier one for him for christmas which mounts right one to the wall, but you cannot take it down or move it. We moved about a month ago an could not take our other one with us without damaging it or the bathtub wall. I bought him this one, it&#x27;s smaller but it works well, all you have to do it run it under the hot shower water for a few seconds, maybe up to 10 seconds and it stays fog free for quite a while. He also said that he likes the fact that you can take it off and move it around, that way you can be sure that you didnt miss anywhere! All in all, great fog free shower mirror, for a great price!</li>
    <li> Everything this mirror claims, no  matter how unbelievable for the price, is 100% accurate.  It is crystal clear and the most you have to do is hold it under the shower for maybe 2 seconds 2-3 times per shower (I take long showers so this number may be a little high).  To keep this review short and sweet I will just say that I can&#x27;t imagine you could ever find anything better for this price.  If you want a shower mirror, look no further, it is perfect.</li>
    <li> Bought one of those great \\&quot;goose neck\\&quot; showerheads on Amazon and just as I was closing out, saw the ad for the shower mirror. Took a chance because it was really inexpensive. Even if it didn&#x27;t work, I wouldn&#x27;t lose much.  I was disappointed with the size of the mirror, however after using it, it became apparent that a bigger mirror would do nothing but reflect stuff you don&#x27;t need to see.  What you need to see is your face and neck - period.  I had never shaved in the shower before and what I love about it is there is absolutely no clean up! I used to get water all over the sink.  Not a big deal to clean this up, but shaving is such a pain, anything that makes it easier is a plus. I followed the directions to mount the hook, but the mirror fell off after about a day or two. I reapplied it with a small drop of Krazy glue.  It won&#x27;t come off again.  I have no concern about hard water spots on the mirror -  I just spray it with distilled water after my shower, just as I do with my glasses - the water rapidly air dries spotlessly without any rubbing.  I turn it to face the wall prior to spraying Clean Shower.</li>
    <li> Smaller then I imagined, unbreakable, good quality plastic, but not really fog free...  Even after 5 seconds ubder hot water, it fills with fog after 3 minutes and I have to repeat the proccess (and wipe the water spots off for a good vision) which can be frustrating...  I gave it three stats since it really is unbreakable, and because when used in a fogless environment the vision is good for a plastic mirror.</li>
    <li> So many fancy solutions to the shaving-in-the-shower problem &amp; this is the best answer by far!  I love this &#x27;Truly Fogless Shave Mirror&#x27;!</li>
    <li> I love this mirror. I can just take it off the hook and wash it off. I was worried it would move around too much but its really great.</li>
    <li> It is NOT fog free. Can be fixed if wiped with your hand but it will eventually catch fog again. I should&#x27;ve not bought it.</li>
    <li> Easy to install and it stays on !! Use a little soap if it fogs at first</li>
    <li> Works well! The few times fog does alight on it all I have to do is run it under the shower stream and it all goes away. This has made shaving in the shower a hell of a lot easier, I recommend to anyone that shower shaves. Also, the mounting hook has never given me issue, still hanging there being all awesome.</li>
    <li> I had read tons of reviews and thought this mirror was simple enough to work.  I was right, this works great!  Run it under the water, hang it up and shave.  It is that simple and it works as advertised.  Yes, there are drops but as my face has been with me for awhile now,,, I can still shave.  This has made shaving in the shower, a breeze. I would recommend this mirror to anyone.      Update 12/21/2014,, three years later and I am still using this everyday in the shower.  This was worth every penny!!  It has not fallen off the wall once.  I sent several of these to relatives and everyone of them is still using it.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Very light and hopefully will not fall down from the wall hook. Mirror seems unbreakable seems like it has a plastic backing. Overall 5 stars. Very good price and very good service by the manufacturer. I actually received an email from the President of the company, thanking me for purchasing his product and giving me some hints in using his product. Now I would call that a very good company service coming from the top.</li>
    <li> ** Update 10.31.2012 **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Changed from 5 star to 2 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now had this mirror for about 8 months or so.  In that time, it&#x27;s been replaced by the company three times because the reflective backing flakes off.  I think the idea of this mirror is excellent, but the manufacturing is just not up to par.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt; - Great Size&lt;br /&gt; - Light Weight&lt;br /&gt; - Nearly Unbreakable&lt;br /&gt; - The customer service is very, very good.  If they do make a next-generation of this mirror with a better backing material, I will try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt; - Poor quality of reflective backing&lt;br /&gt; - Mirror does fog up despite the claims&lt;br /&gt; - Retains water spots unless constantly rinsed in shower&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Original Review **&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with the mirror and the customer service.  Overall very satisfied.  When I first received it, I thought it was a bit small and noticed a lot of water spots. After a few days of use, I feel like the mirror is the perfect size and it doesn&#x27;t seem to gather water spots anymore.  It&#x27;s perfect for my use.  Now I just need this same company to produce a razor holder for the shower - all the ones I&#x27;ve found use cheap suction cups!</li>
    <li> Solid product...  after holding it under the hot water for a few and then hanging it back up I rarely have fog issues.</li>
    <li> This is the first fog free shaving mirror I have used that actually does what the manufacturer claims it does.  Just follow the enclosed instructions and you will have no problems. (Instructions are quite simple) This mirror does not fog and does not fall off the shower wall.  Try it your&#x27;e going to like it if you shave in the shower.</li>
    <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve bought so many mirrors to shave in the shower I lost count but this one is clearly the best buy for the $ hands down.</li>
    <li> This fogs as easily as the regular mirror that I had in the shower so I am very disappointed.  It is on a hook so if you rinse it off with the water, then you can use it but my regular mirror did that and was much cheaper</li>
    <li> I have this mirror from last 12 months -- it worked great for the first 9 months but have stopped working recently</li>
    <li> A nice fog free mirror that works well. Just run it under water for a few seconds and it will stay fog free for 3-4 minutes. Usually long enough to shave, if not just run it under water again. The mirror is made of a durable acrylic an is easy to handle. The hook allows for convenient placement and holds the mirror solidly in place. There just a few downsides. The mirror is rather small at 4x6 inches. Although the size is listed in the description I overlooked that when I placed my order and was quite shocked once the mirror arrived. The diminutive size does cause a few problems as the mirror sometimes fogs up from my breath when holding it too close to my face. A larger mirror would have alleviated this problem. Another issue is that the mirror does show water spots after drying, supposedly this can be eliminated by polishing the mirror with toothpaste, but I have not tried this. Overall a nice mirror that I can see myself using for quite a while, but it is not without it flaws.</li>
    <li> If Jesus Christ were alive today he would be this mirror!!!  It&#x27;s clear as a bell and the little hookey thing to hang the mirror on is sufficiently sticky and works great!  I&#x27;m glad I bought it and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This mirror really works. Just hold it under the warm water for 2 sec and it is ready to go. Grade A+</li>
    <li> Overpriced but as advertised.</li>
    <li> We had a problem with the adhesive hook for our shower mirror.  This could have totally been our fault with the installment. However, the company was wonderful to deal with and quickly sent out a replacement- no questions asked!  Marvelous customer service.</li>
    <li> There is no size in the product description and it was a lot smaller than I&#x27;d thought it would be.  The mirror isn&#x27;t even as big as a small paperback book. It is way too small for what I wanted it for. I don&#x27;t see how anyone could shave using this mirror because you can&#x27;t even see your whole face.  I have no idea if it is truly fog free, however, because I never took it out of the box except to see the size.</li>
    <li> I thought on first glance that the mirror was going to be too small, but after using it I find that it is adequate unless you stand too far away while shaving. It is some type of plastic so no worries about breaking it. It does remain fog free for most of my shave although I do occasionally have to hold it under the water twice. The adhesive hook seems to hold fine on smooth tile. I have been using mine for about a month with no problems. A nice inexspensive shave mirror.</li>
    <li> After much wrangling with other shower mirrors with allegedly magical coatings that attempt to get them to overcome the laws of physics (vapor will form on a surface colder than the water vapor, period) -- this is an elegantly simple solution. Looks great, durable, and it actually works. Good value for the price. Period.</li>
    <li> seriously just buy this already stop reading reviews.</li>
    <li> Nice little mirror.  I love it since it hangs on a hook and is not stuck to the wall or shower stem. To clean or defog just pick it up and run the mirror under the water.  simple and easy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a few weeks now and it works exactly as advertised. Few seconds under the water and it stays fog free for a shave. I also really like the fact that it&#x27;s not permanently wall mounted but instead placed on a hook. It&#x27;s small enough to comfortably hold in one hand while shaving with the other.    For $9.99 I&#x27;m just sad that I didn&#x27;t get this much earlier because it&#x27;s simplified my life significantly!     Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> After trying other shaving mirrors over the last 50 years of shaving this is the ONLY one that actually works. That is it. It works so well that after being a customer of Amazon&#x27;s since it first opened it&#x27;s internet doors to sell books, this is the only review I have ever written and probably the last. Buy it, you can&#x27;t go wrong for 10 bucks.</li>
    <li> Works as described. The hook is a better idea then the suction cups which always seem to fall.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let my review title fool you. If you follow the directions, it works just as it says it does.    I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week now and used that time to figure out how it works. Just like the box says, you run it under your shower stream for a few seconds and there is no fog on the mirror surface. However, the fog only stays away for so many minutes. I figured out that the higher the water temperature you place the mirror under, the longer the fog stays away. If the fog does come back, just put the mirror under the water again and you&#x27;re back in business. So yes, you MAY have to run it under the water a few times during your shower, but it all depends on how long it takes you to shave. The included hook works well for this mirror.    Even though you might have to run the mirror under the water a few times, a few seconds is well worth the convenience of shaving in the shower.</li>
    <li> It is not as small as I though when reading other reviews (not really big, but enough for shaving).  Regarding the \\&quot;fog free\\&quot; feature, putting the mirror in the warm water to equalize the temperature works quite well, though I usually have to put it under the water again in the end of my shaving, since it starts to get fog... But maybe I take longer than average shaving ;-)</li>
    <li> We have travertine tile in our shower and I don&#x27;t want to use anything that would damage it.  I&#x27;ve tried various suction mirrors and none worked because the mirror was too heavy so they fell off.  This mirror is extremely light, has no frame, so doesn&#x27;t put too much weight on the mount.  Perfect.</li>
    <li> These mirrors are fantastic.  Just run it under the water for a second to bring it up to temp and it provides more than enough fogless minutes to shave.  They last forever, too.  We have really hard water in AZ, so I make sure to wipe it down after use to keep it spot free.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Ok, say here&#x27;s the deal...this gets 1star for false advertising. Not EVEN CLOSE to being fog free. Cheap piece of flimsy plastic with no apparent &#x27;anti fogging&#x27; coating of any kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works just fine, and it&#x27;s cheap...and it&#x27;s pretty much unbreakable, and could travel with it if you wanted too. The fogging thing...actually not a big deal...just splash water on it.</li>
    <li> Like the others stated - it seems very small initially but it is the perfect size for its purpose and it does stay fog free.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the Fog Free Shower Shave Mirror.  Mirror performs as described.  After dropping countless \\&quot;foggy\\&quot; mirrors in the shower (totaling about 21 years of bad luck), I finally have a mirror that mounts to the wall and makes shaving a breeze.  No need to deal with suction cups or filling up reservoirs as with other products. Simply run mirror under hot water and let the grooming begin!  Fast shipping and excellent communication from Shave Well.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY this product! It fogs up as soon as steam fills the tub. My husband does NOT like as he has to continually wipe away fog.</li>
    <li> Ok, I admit it. Once I realized (after an email from Bill Vogel representing the company), that there was an opaque cover which needed to be removed, I soon found myself taking my foot out of my mouth. Nice reflectivity, and I always liked everything else about the product. So, with a little help from my friends, I can now recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shower mirror because it was the only \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirror that didn&#x27;t require me to fill it up with warm water, and it was $10 so it was worth taking a chance. I have had it for several months and must say that I am not disappointed. I just hold the mirror in front of the shower stream for a few seconds before I start shaving and it stays clear for the entire shave. My first impression is that it is quite small, but I actually like the size for shaving and doesn&#x27;t take up too much real estate in the shower. The included adhesive hook holds well and I haven&#x27;t ever worried about this thing falling off the wall. Great shave mirror.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll get the one gripe out of the way - I wish it was bigger, maybe like 6x9, or 7x10. Other than that, it is great. Light, fog free after the quick rinse, and crystal clear.</li>
    <li> Works just as advertised - very light, a quick rinse under warm shower water keeps it from fogging up.  I like that it&#x27;s acrylic as I use it to buzz my hair in the shower and was worried if i dropped a glass mirror I&#x27;d be standing in glass.</li>
    <li> Awesome product and ingenious design! First time in a long time I got a clean shave in the shower. Depending on the condition in the room i.e. temp in the room, temp in the shower, etc the mirror may fog up during the shave, but sticking it under the water for 2-3 sec does the trick. I&#x27;m thinking of buying one more just in case.    Yes, it&#x27;s relatively small, but my face fits perfectly there, so can&#x27;t complain on the size. The hook comes with doublesided tape already attached so installing it takes seconds - finding the spot that would work for you better takes longer than sticking it on the wall.</li>
    <li> Better than any other mirror i have had so far. I almost exclusively shave in the shower. Only complaint is that this is a bit small.</li>
    <li> Like a s***ty mirror that fogs up in room temp. Then by all means, order this piece of s***.</li>
    <li> This product works very well. It is not glass, its plastic so it is very light but it isn&#x27;t one of those fake \\&quot;shiny surface\\&quot; kind of plastic mirrors. It is a real mirror.</li>
    <li> Looked for a mirror that would work in the shower. The cost of this one was was low and the design simple.  Simple works better .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll make it simple:  Cheap  Convenient  Works great  Saves me five to ten minutes a day, and that adds up</li>
    <li> I really like this mirror. The simplicity of the design is what makes it such a good product. As advertised, you remove the mirror from the hook, run it under water to equalize the temps, and it stays fog free. Unfortunately, the hook that came with mine only stuck to my tile shower for a few weeks before falling off the wall and chipping my mirror in the process. Since the mirror is plastic, and the chip was minor, I simply purchased a new hook and kept right on going. My suggestion would be to get a suction-cup hook to go with this great little mirror. (Yeah... I said it... suction cups)</li>
    <li> I have always shaved in the shower and this is the first mirror I havent had to fight with to get it to stay on the wall. I am thinking about painting the white hook silver. I had tried a few other brands that claim will stay on a shower wall with these types of hooks but I kept coming home to find them in the bottom of the tub. So far I have no problems at all with this product and probably won&#x27;t buy again cause this one looks like it is built to last a lifetime. Great product!!</li>
    <li> Give it a shot.  Shaving in the shower is awesome.  The mirror doesn&#x27;t fog and allows you to achieve the close shave on your defined jaw line that you&#x27;ve always dreamed about.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the high ratings and number of people rating it highly. This mirror is nothing special, it&#x27;s a plexiglass sheet with reflective backing and a hole drilled in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no anti-fog coating whatsoever. It is &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; solely because it is plastic and can be warmed up quickly. But it doesn&#x27;t resist fogging and it is always covered with drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the price and ratings, I would have at least expected an anti-fog coating as is found on swimming goggles or other brands of shower mirror.</li>
    <li> This mirror definitely performs as described and lasts through a long shave. I&#x27;ve accidentally dropped it a couple times with my soapy hands, and there&#x27;s not a chip, scratch or ding in it. Solid piece of product - Highly recommend you pick one up.</li>
    <li> This mirror works as advertised.  I am also very impressed with the high quality of customer service provided.  Apparently I did not read the instructions (imagine that) and did not remove the protective coating.  Customer service promptly righted my wrong and we are now in business. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have to shave in the shower because of my very sensitive skin.  This mirror works well and rarely fogs on me even though I take insane hot showers.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror for my husband for his birthday. He really needed a new mirror, the one he had was covered in soap scum. The mirror does exactly what it says it does....wet it with hot water before you are ready to use it and the mirror stays clear of steam.</li>
    <li> I would not technically call this a \\&quot;FOG FREE\\&quot; mirror.  The directions just say to place the mirror under hot water for a few seconds before use.  This will work with ANY mirror.</li>
    <li> I AM NOT A MAN OF MANY WORDS. BUT IF YOU WANT THE BEST AND THE LOWEST PRICED SHOWER MIRROR THAT WORKS. YOU MUST GET THIS MIRROR, IT WORKS GREAT AND THE PEOPLE THAT SELL THEM ARE OF THE BEST!!!! GIVE IT A TRY AND YOU WILL BE HAPPY YOU DID. THIS IS THE ONLY SHOWER MIRROR THAT I HAVE FOUND THAT WORKS.  THANKS AGAIN.  KC</li>
    <li> I like to shave int he shower. I have a thick beard and sensitive skin, and shaving in the shower is the only way I can get a good shave and not slice my face to ribbons. So I&#x27;ve gone through many a shower mirror. We have smooth tile, but suction-cup mirrors used to fall off once a month or so, and as suction cups have been down-gauged over the years this has accelerated to once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This box contains the obvious (yet uncommon) solution: a plain old adhesive hook. Install it, and it never falls off. Perfect. Not that you&#x27;d worry, the very simple acrylic mirror weighs next-to-nothing. it&#x27;s just a rounded rectangle of acrylic, mirrored on one side, with a simple hole in it. Simple and perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just hold it under the water a moment and enjoy a worry-free shave. This practice also slows the appearance of water spots, which lead to the demise of many a shower mirror.</li>
    <li> Just got this and first impression, Its small, we are talking about size of your palm. I expected it to be bigger. Its like 4x5 inches or something. I looked at the description again and can&#x27;t see the size mentioned. I just assumed it would be normal size for a face.  Just so you know..</li>
    <li> Works great.  After reading the reviews I knew to rinse both sides of the mirror to keep it from fogging, but I was also pleasantly surprised when the company emailed me as well.</li>
    <li> From the reviews so far I guess I was expecting this to be the best anti-fog shower mirror in the world.  But I&#x27;ve used it for over a week now, and am disappointed.    After running water over it for several seconds, you are left with a \\&quot;mirror\\&quot; (it isn&#x27;t glass) surface full of water droplets which even after repeatedly wiping them off, make it pretty hard to see clearly to shave.    Boo.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Shave Well mirror for my husband.  He likes it so much I plan on ordering one for my nephew and both my brothers.  It is light weight and small enough for easy packing when traveling, yet large enough for a perfect close up shave.  I know Christmas is a few months away, but this will make a great stocking stuffer for all the men on my list!</li>
    <li> This was super small when it came.  The picture is very different .</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t fancy. It isn&#x27;t too big or too small. It&#x27;s just right. And it works, which is better than the other 4 shower mirrors I&#x27;ve tried. And the price is good. Buy it. Buy it now.</li>
    <li> I have used many shower shaving mirrors before, all disappointing, but this one really lives up to its claims. Most of the others mounted to the shower wall, and they&#x27;d fog immediately. I&#x27;d end up trying to \\&quot;throw\\&quot; water at them to get them to clear up, but the fog and streaking would immediately reappear. Those mirrors weren&#x27;t heavy-duty enough to hold the heat, which is the trick.  This mirror&#x27;s heavy duty surface is what retains the heat when held under the shower, and the quality of the reflection is first class. I&#x27;ve gotten into the habit of holding the mirror in one hand and shaving with the other. That way, I can quickly re-heat the mirror if needed, but more importantly, realign my face and mirror for the best lighting and focal distance.  I haven&#x27;t had to polish the mirror with toothpaste yet, but the other mirrors all warned me not to clean them with anything, as it would wreck their special coatings. This mirror&#x27;s design doesn&#x27;t rely on \\&quot;special\\&quot; coatings that don&#x27;t work anyway, and allows for you to restore the surface with a gentle abrasive (toothpaste) when and if needed.    I even received an email from the president (OK, I&#x27;m sure it was a form letter) making sure I knew how to use it and that I was satisfied. That&#x27;s First Class!  The hardest part for me was trying to get the protective plastic coating off of the surface of the mirror when I opened the package.    I love this mirror. I travel a lot, and think I&#x27;ll buy another to keep in my travel bag with my travel toiletries so I can enjoy a nice shave in the hotel showers, too.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Father&#x27;s day gift for my fiance. For the price it really works well. It is very light weight and gets the job done for him while he is shaving in the shower. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is in the market for a fog free mirror and not looking to spend a lot of money or buy a very bulky item.</li>
    <li> MIRROR IS VERY SMALL  FELL OFF AFTER A WEEK  THE BEST THING - IT&#x27;S A FOG FREE MIRROR THAT FOGS  !!!</li>
    <li> I was really skeptical about trying ANOTHER fog free mirror...we have never had any luck with these...but after reading a few reviews, I decided to try it....WOW, it really works....my husband loves it....it was also nice to get an e-mail from the sender explaining how it works and how to maintain it....I think this one it a keeper...:)</li>
    <li> Had several shower mirrors in the past that ended up falling off and breaking because they were very bulky.  Also the fogging was a major issue.  This mirror is small and lightweight.  I thought the small size would be limiting but actually it has not been an issue.  I usually hold it while shaving and then hang it when I need to shave by my neck.  You do have to hold it under the hot water for a minute or two as instructed to avoid the fogging.  Did not like the idea of permanently mounting a hook on my tile so I ended up buying a suction cup hook from the local hardware store instead of using the adhesive hook that was provided.  Since the mirror is so lightweight have not had any issues of it falling.</li>
    <li> This thing is horrible.  They say to hold it in the water to equalize the temperature but then the stupid thing is covered in water and you can&#x27;t see!  Then it comes with some stupid hook that when you hang it back up on the wall, its swinging there making if impossible to see anything while it swings back and forth.  I&#x27;m returning this piece of garbage.  Save yourself some time and damage to your shower by this stupid sticky hook thing.</li>
    <li> Bought it for a gift for my hubby... It works just as stated... You have to warm p the mirror so irritant fog by running it under the water for a beat... It stays clear!  Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Received the mirror and easily peeled off the from protective layer. Ran the mirror under hot shower water for about 10 seconds and then set it on an existing shower caddy to see what happened.  The mirror remained fog free as advertised!  So nice to have this for shaving in the morning. Good job on making a simple, effective and affordable product.</li>
    <li> Serves it&#x27;s purpose, I love my mirror. If I see a little fog, I just run it under the water and it&#x27;s resolved &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> It works just as you&#x27;d expect it to. It seems a little overpriced for what it is, especially the size. But it works, no fogging, lightweight, won&#x27;t break, easy for my husband to grab and use in the shower one-handed while shaving.</li>
    <li> I have had several fog free mirrors and this is the best and cheapest! You will be extremely happy with this mirror as long as you put it under the hot water for about 10-15 seconds.  I take it off the hook and let the hot water from the shower run over the back and front of the mirror for a short time and I have no problems getting through a shave without it fogging up.  It will fog up if you don&#x27;t do this simple step.</li>
    <li> This mirror is good for what I use it for (travel shaving mirror).  The anti-fog mechanism is...wait for it...heat up the mirror in the shower water.  This is the only consistent way to make an fog-free shower mirror.  Coated mirrors that claim to be fog-proof are simply BS, in my experience.  Good:  * Very lightweight  * Durable; Seems pretty hard to break  * Inexpensive (if I do break it)  * The \\&quot;anti-fog\\&quot; mechanism works as well as you&#x27;d expect  * The hook definitely looks like it won&#x27;t fall off the wall  Bad:  * Mounting the hook for shower placement means using the included double-sided foam tape.  A suction-cup hook would have been better for me, but was easy enough to obtain.  * Too small for my home-based mirror.  It&#x27;s not too small to shave with, I just prefer something larger.  I&#x27;ve had a Showertek mirror for many years now and I decided to go with another one at home.  * Just to be contrary to my previous item, it&#x27;s a little too large for my travel mirror. This should be no problem to someone placing it permanently in a shower.  Overall, I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I like shaving in the shower. For me this mirror is important. It does fog up sometimes but for the most part it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Spent a lot of time looking for and testing shower mirrors. This is exactly what I wanted and at a price anyone can afford.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product - absolutely remains fog free after just a few seconds of warming in the shower water. I also like the fact that I can travel with it: it hangs from a hook and is not permanently attached nor has large suction cups behind and is actually quite light.</li>
    <li> Only advice I&#x27;ll give for this product is to read the description from start to finish!  Take note of the size of the mirror...that&#x27;s right, this thing is ridiculously small.  Be sure that you&#x27;ll be ok with such a tiny mirror to shave with.  I think the idea is that you&#x27;re supposed to hold the mirror while you shave.  I&#x27;m not a big fan of that, I would much rather have the mirror hanging on the shower wall and shave that way.  As a result, I never even used the mirror, but I&#x27;m sure the fog-free feature works just fine.  It&#x27;s small enough that it&#x27;ll always acclimate to the air temperature in the shower, keeping it fogless.  Just be cautious of it&#x27;s size before ordering!</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror a few months ago because I like shaving in the shower - and most fog-free mirrors I&#x27;ve used before have been disappointing. The design is super simple and functional - the mirror has a hole in the upper center that&#x27;s used to hang it off the included self-adhesive hook. The hook seems strong - I put it on and it hasn&#x27;t budged.     About a week into using the mirror, I noticed some minor delamination of the mirror material at the bottom of it. It certainly wasn&#x27;t enough to affect its functionality, but I sent an email to the company to tell them about it. Some responded very quickly letting me know that it shouldn&#x27;t be that way and that they would send me out a free replacement, and that he would follow up in a couple weeks.     That&#x27;s exactly what happened - I quickly received the replacement and a followup, and sure enough the replacement isn&#x27;t affected by the same issue the first one was. I&#x27;m impressed that for such a small/simple item, this company goes far beyond what I would expect in terms of customer service, and they really stand behind the quality of their product.     The fog-free mirror is as advertised, too - you just run it under the shower for a few seconds, and it easily stays clear for long enough for a nice shave.</li>
    <li> Great little simple mirror. Does the job an is very indiscreet in my shower which I like.</li>
    <li> This is the best shower mirror on the market, especially for the price.  I was so happy with the first one that I ordered 2 more for 2 of my other showers and I will probably order one more for traveling.  I wish I would have thought of it, it&#x27;s so simple and it works.</li>
    <li> Have not used other \\&quot;in the shower\\&quot; mirrors but am very satisfied with this product.  Remembered seeing a review stating that the mirror is small and that is true.  Also noted that the size works fine in actual use and that is very true as well.  Nothing to fiddle with or fuss with, it simply works.  Very satisfied with the product and the companies customer service, which has been top notch.</li>
    <li> Purchased the product 1 month ago, so far it works exactly as expected.  Depending on where you hang the mirror and the surrounding airflow temperatures, you may have to occasionally splash water on it to keep it fog-free, but this isn&#x27;t enough of an annoyance for me to justify spending more money on a model with a water well in the base of the mirror.</li>
    <li> This little mirror works very well and works exactly as the manufacturer describes. Because this mirror hangs from a hook (rather than a suction cup), it never falls or slides down the shower wall. If for some reason the included sticky hook doesn&#x27;t work on a shower surface, I imagine that one could use another kind of hook purchased from a local hardware store (this was not an issue I faced--the included hook stuck and is still sticking well to a fiberglass shower insert). The mirror may be a bit smaller than one would expect by looking at the product page, but it reflects clearly and shows all that anyone would need to shave their face. A quick rinse of the mirror on both sides with warm or hot shower water gets rid of fogging, making this a convenient, lightweight mirror that is perfect for daily shaving.</li>
    <li> PERFECT! I went online to find a substitute for my mirror with suction cups that wouldn&#x27;t stay up. I did WAY too much searching through reviews and thought I&#x27;d have to pay a bunch for what I wanted to have one that stayed up. Not so. This one is exactly what I&#x27;d hoped for. Easy Easy Easy. Works Works Works. And the price is what it should be for something like this.</li>
    <li> This mirror does not stay fog free. It is supposed to adapt to the amount of fog in your shower area and remain clear after that, but this does not happen. I had to splash water on it every 20 seconds for it to remain clear. It is worthless.</li>
    <li> This works using a very simple concept. If the mirror is the same temp as the water in your shower, it won&#x27;t fog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ironically when my [[ASIN:B000I7D2L4 Zadro Z300 Wall Mountable Fog Free Mirror]] stopped working right, I would pull it off the wall, but because of the design, it was a pain to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is simple. Hook off, run mirror under water for 5 seconds, done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes  you end up with some water left on the mirror, but you just have to adjust the angle when you run it under the water. NOT a big deal at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, great price and will work forever. There is NO fog free coating hocus-pokus to worry about.</li>
    <li> To me, there is no better way to shave then in the shower. I mean, who wants to go the ritual of filling the sink and making another mess?  I&#x27;ve bought a few so-called &amp;#34;fog free&amp;#34; mirrors, even from elite mail order sites which degraded over a short time, but this product has my vote for simplicity and cleanliness. The suction cup has held to our shower tile continuously over time. Being so light weight, it easily travels. I&#x27;ve taken it on cruises and to hotels to enjoy shaving in a long, hot showers on their dime!  This is a very together US business with a philosophy of quality and customer support.</li>
    <li> This product changed my life... Why have I not been shaving in the shower? Just a smooth, clean and perfect shave every time. I&#x27;m sure a shower mirror is a shower mirror but I can garantee you this one works exactly as the description says... And those of you saying \\&quot;blah blah it is junk it still fogs up\\&quot; well all I have to say to you is..Your an idiot and learn to read instructions on how to use the product before claiming it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I love a good design. Simple yet functional. No suction cup - just an unobtrusive hook that stays put, and a small mirror that is the perfect size. Stays fog free long enough for me to shave. If you are a shower shaver, and you&#x27;re tired of those bulky over-priced suction cup deals, I highly recommend the Shave Well mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 10/03/2012:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this mirror now for 6 months or so and wanted to add a few thoughts. While the mirror does stay fog free for a good while, I find that I usually will need to re-wet the mirror again about 1/2 way through my shave. Maybe I&#x27;m taking too much time to shave. Also, there are a lot of water spots, even right after warming up the mirror. I saw a suggestion to rub a small amount of toothpaste on the mirror and then rinse to reduce the water spotting, but that didn&#x27;t really help much. Of course this could be due to the hardness of my water or something like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;ve started doing is after I warm up the mirror under the shower, I give it a light spray with one of those \\&quot;Daily Shower Cleaner\\&quot; sprays. This eliminates the water spots and keeps the mirror completely fog free for the entire duration of my shower. The drawback: what ever chemicals are in this spray seem to be reacting with the backing of the mirror because I can see some deterioration along the edges of the mirror. No big deal to me, because it&#x27;s inexpensive enough and I can just replace the mirror once a year or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I think it&#x27;s still the best option for a shower mirror.</li>
    <li> I saw earlier reviews that people were surprised at how small it seemed, but I did not have the same reaction. I had read the description  so I knew what to expect. I like it, no bells or whistles, just a straight up simple mirror. For the money you can&#x27;t beat it&#x27;s functionality.</li>
    <li> Got this mirror for shaving in the shower, works great, it is indeed fog free, BUT I am unhappy with the product because the hook that it included does not stay on the wall, it fell off after a couple of days.</li>
    <li> I can say that I tested - it doesn&#x27;t break after falling down on tile floor.  It is easy to use, have to warm up in water and after that works like fog free mirror.  It is big enough to see whole face.</li>
    <li> This product, as described is simple. It is very lightweight and the hook adhears easily to shower. The prodcut does an ok job of not fogging. I do prefer a hot shower and running the mirror under the hot water for a few seconds is the only way to clear it up...for a few minutes. It will fog up again. The advantage of this mirror compared to other \\&quot;fog-free\\&quot; mirrors is the ability to remove it from the hook and run it under the water. Probably not worth even the $10 it sells for here. Get a higher quality mirror is my suggestion.</li>
    <li> I could not believe the sharpness of this mirror when I took it out of the package.  I was amazed.  I though for sure it would not last long, but it has!  A month later the image still looks great.  I added Green Earth Rain Repellent, but I do not believe this was needed.      Also, the tip about the tooth paste to clean water stains works!  I haven&#x27;t needed it for the mirror, but I have well water and my window that gets hit with the water was covered with water stains.  Tooth paste took it right off!      Thank you for a good product and great tip!</li>
    <li> does the job, 95% of the time I don&#x27;t even have to put it under the water to defog it, it just stay&#x27;s defogged. I gave it 4 stars because it could be a little bigger and the attachment looks cheap. But for the price it does the job.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Dad and he loves it!  There was a small problem with it after using it everyday for a long time, and my Mom called customer service and got a new one right away. It&#x27;s nice to see someone still is customer service oriented!!!</li>
    <li> I have had many so called \\&quot;Fog Free\\&quot; mirrors over the years and they all seem to not last very long and some are quite expensive.This little fog free mirror is great! Not only is it fog free after running under the shower for a second, but it hangs easily on the shower wall with it&#x27;s own hook.This mirror is by far the best mirror I have ever had and the price is right too! I highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> This is a great shaving mirror! I have two - one for traveling and one for my home shower. They work great.  Put them under very hot water for about 40 seconds so the mirror heats up then just hang on its hook and you can shave without the mirror fogging up - works just like advertised.  The only reason it doesn&#x27;t get five stars is that it does not have a slick enough surface for water droplets to slide off, but one gets used to that quickly and it really is no issue. If they could get the water drops to slide off it would be perfect. For the price buy it or them you won&#x27;t regret it - I didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Like many, I was a bit surprised at the size. The product description does contain dimensions, which I could have seen had I read the entire description.   As to how this product receives such high reviews? It&#x27;s an extremely well thought out, simple, effective product. It&#x27;s just the right size. It&#x27;s easy to install the hook. It&#x27;s easy to remove it from the hook to heat it up under the hot shower water. And because of it&#x27;s low mass, it only takes a second to reach a temperature where it won&#x27;t fog up.   I&#x27;m sure that it costs a fraction of the purchase price to produce it, but I&#x27;m not just paying for a piece of plastic. I&#x27;m happy to pay for an effective shaving system - well engineered and produced.   I would recommend this to anybody who likes to shave in the shower. I&#x27;m pleased that I purchased it every time I use it.   BTW, the customer service sytem that they have in place is equally well thought out and executed. Well done to The Cumberland Companies.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! After my morning workout at the gym, I used to shave AFTER showering. Now I take this mirror into the shower making shaving there much easier. I glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> Sometimes simple really is better.  This is by far the best shave mirror I&#x27;ve ever used.  You don&#x27;t need reservoirs, batteries, piping, spray films, or any of the other solutions to the problem of mirror fogging.  All you need is to do is raise the temperature of the mirror enough that fog doesn&#x27;t form.  You splash this thing under the water and you&#x27;re done. SIMPLE!!!!  Works great.  And it is PLENTY BIG ENOUGH for shaving, nose hair trimming, zit picking, or anything else you want to do in the shower.  The people who complain about it&#x27;s size must be way too into their own reflection.  Get it.  Update:  1 year later. Still love it. Update2: 2 years later. Still love it. Update3: 6 years later. Still love it.</li>
    <li> Once upon, I had a water-resistant shower radio that had a flip up fogless mirror.  The radio died, but I continued to use the mirror for shaving.  The mirror became more and more craptastic over time until it became unuseable.  I no longer need the radio, but do like shaving in the shower and do like having a mirror to facilitate the process.  This little piece of plastic is truly a handy little thing.  Run it under the shower stream for a few seconds and it remains fog free for the length of my shower.  It does what it&#x27;s meant to do.    Having it hang from the little hook means that I can grab it and use it as a hand-mirror when needed.  With the little hole for the hook, I could even use it as an emergency signaling mirror when the zombie-apocalypse rears it&#x27;s ugly frickin&#x27; head!  Hopefully the Mayans got it wrong, but 2012 is coming and it&#x27;s nice to know that this little piece of plastic can do double-duty when society collapses with the discovery that there is no gold in Fort Knox!  Seriously, I like this thing.  Just remember to peel off the opaque-ish protective film... It took me a couple of days and input from my wife to figger that out.  I may not be very bright, but landing headshots on zombies is where I make my hay!</li>
    <li> My search for a fog free mirror is officially over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simplicity is the key here. Attach the provided hook to the glass (better than attaching to tile) of the shower wall, and hang this mirror on it. When you&#x27;re ready to shave, take the mirror off the hook and hold it under the running hot water for about five seconds. This makes the mirror the same temp as the water, and thus impossible to fog up (steam results from temperature differences between a surface and the air; if they&#x27;re the SAME temp, it cannot form). It seems like a cheap trick to run it under water, because running water will wash away the fog from ANY mirror. However, because this mirror is thin, it retains the heat and remains at the water temp for quite some time. Other mirrors quickly cool off and form fog again. This one does not, at least not over the next five minutes. I guess if you left if hanging for 15 minutes fog would form again, but that&#x27;s beside the point. If it takes you that long between your decision to shave and the actual act, then you need to enroll in a time management class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complaints I have read re: Size. It is kind of small at 4\\&quot;  x 6\\&quot;. Having said that, it is PLENTY large enough to see my entire face to shave. Plus, even if it were not, I&#x27;m only shaving my lower face, and it is generous enough to show that. Unless your head is the size of Herman Munster&#x27;s, you&#x27;ll have plenty of room to see your ugly mug to remove that nasty hair and make yourself handsome again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Re: falling off the wall. Yeah, mine did that too. Simple fix is to use shower/tub clear silicone caulk ($5 at a hardware store), put a dab onto the back of the wall hook, stick to the shower glass and let it sit overnight, and you&#x27;re done. It won&#x27;t fall of again. So, this is a non-issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made mine even better by applying three coats of Rain-X (yes, the stuff you put on your windshield to force water beads to stay as beads instead of running together; if you do not own this product, you ought to because it&#x27;s the very best automotive product I&#x27;ve used and does exactly what it says). With it applied, after I put the mirror under the water, the water that remains on the surface beads up nicely, so I am not looking through smudged water streaks trying to see my skin. It&#x27;s a miracle product this Rain-X stuff. I use it on my car every month and don&#x27;t even bother turning my windshield wipers on when it rains. That&#x27;s how GREAT it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you follow the very simple instructions, it works. Best of all? It cannot fail, because there are no moving parts, no electric components, no pieces to fit together, etc. Run it under hot water and enjoy fog free shaving. That&#x27;s all there is to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get it and don&#x27;t like it, return it. But if you don&#x27;t like it, then the problem is likely with you and not this simple-to-use product that performs exactly as advertised. In my experience, that is very rare indeed.very best automotive product I&#x27;ve used and does exactly what it says).

    <li> I&#x27;ve been through countless mirrors for my shower.  They all failed miserably because the suction cups only last for so long and in the middle of the night &lt;&lt;crash!!&gt;  This mirror is a tad small, but it&#x27;s so light and with the strong sticker-hook, it will never come crashing down.  Exactly what I needed!!</li>
    <li> This mirror is not bad at all.  It is not fancy at all.  Very simple.  I think design could be improved (but not in terms of function - that is fine) to make it look a bit more \\&quot;finished\\&quot; around the edges of the mirror.  But it does its job very well and it is not expensive.  I am glad my wife got it for me.</li>
    <li> the mirror is great, works perfectly and exactly as advertised. more impressive is the company and its customer service. I will definitely be buying from Cumberland again. 5 stars all around.</li>
    <li> I got this for Christmas, it&#x27;s okay.  It starts to fog up after about 5 minutes or if you breath near it and you have to run it under the water again.</li>
    <li> Love this mirror!!! Got it for my husband and as long as you hold it under the water, as directed, it truly works! Just a hint - the \\&quot;protective coating\\&quot; you have to remove when you first receive it is the cardboard side with the instructions :)  I WON&#x27;T TELL YOU HOW LONG IT TOOK ME TO FIGURE THAT OUT!!! Lol</li>
    <li> This product works exactly as described and you get an email immediately after purchase urging you to contact them if you have any questions or problems.  Awesome!</li>
    <li> The mirror works great.  I just briefly run it under hot water and can finish shaving without having to do so again.  It&#x27;s plenty big for its purpose, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  The only question remaining for me is how long it remains fog-free.  If it&#x27;s permanent, it&#x27;s close to a perfect product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update after 2 years of use:  The mirror continues to work great.  I occasionally have to run it under the hot water a second time while shaving, but that takes all of 2 seconds.  The only maintenance we do is clean the mirror occasionally.  I&#x27;d buy this again without hesitation.</li>
    <li> Been using this for quite a while and it works as advertised. Put it under the water to normalize the temperature prior to shaving and it won&#x27;t fog up while you shave.&lt;br /&gt;That said it does tend to get hard water spots very easily. Yes toothpaste works to clean it off. Somewhat annoying though.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I would suggest using Command Water Proof strips, medium sized, for mounting on a bath/shower wall. That way it can easily be removed later on.</li>
    <li> The mirror works great. I can shave now in 1/2 the time it previously took me. I leave the mirror under the shower for at least 30 seconds to insure it does not re-fog, once that is done it is good to go. I have the mirror placed on the side of the shower and it is doing a great job, still can&#x27;t believe the price, I paid a total of $15.00 for mirror and shipping and could not be anymore satisified. Will be my go-to gift this year. Keep up the good work, glad to see it&#x27;s made in America!</li>
    <li> After looking at all the options of mirrors I like this one because you take it off the provided hook and run it under the water for a few seconds and it stays fog free during my shower/shave. If it fogs up I pull it off for 2 seconds and let the water clear it again and hook it back with no problem. A bigger option would be cool but this is perfect compared to the other mirrors I have tried. I also like that it has no plastic around the mirror which tends to get funky after a while. Well done.</li>
    <li> I got this mirror as a gift for my boyfriend. When I received it I was super disappointed about the size... its about the size of a greeting card. I was hesitant but gave it to him anyway. Turns out its exactly what he had in mind because he wanted a smaller mirror he could hold while shaving. Sweet! The hook is firmly in place and the fog-freeness of it is so so. Its bounds and leaps better than a regular mirror but not 100%. He&#x27;s happy with it.  Oh! Don&#x27;t forget to run it under the hot water. That&#x27;s what makes it work. Works even better if you wipe it dry it right after you warm it.</li>
    <li> I followed the simple instructions.  Tried all the suggested troubleshooting methods... and in every case the mirror would fog up again after 10 seconds or so.  Maybe I&#x27;m living in an alternate universe with different physics, but the \\&quot;science\\&quot; behind this product sure doesn&#x27;t work in mine.  I&#x27;m going back to [[ASIN:B003M6AS92 InterDesign Fog Away Suction Mirror, Clear]].  My old one worked great until it fell and cracked the plastic that holds the hot water surrounding the mirror -- but at least that method of preventing fogging works in my universe.</li>
    <li> The product worked just as described by the manufacturer. The company&#x27;s customer service was great; starting with an email explaining how to set the item up and offering additional services if needed. Fortunately I didn&#x27;t need it because the mirror works great. All around good purchase! Thank you Amazon.com for the free shipping!!!!! :)</li>
    <li> Received the mirror yesterday, installed it in less a minute and shaved with it this morning. The price is excellent, a perfect size for shaving, crystal clear without distortion, looks great, seems very well made, a quick rinse under water and its adequately fog proof. I can highly recommend the product and thinking about buying another for my 2nd bath, an extra for travel might also be a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used it once so an update in a few months is in order...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/14/2012- Just bought my 2nd for my other shower.</li>
    <li> This shower mirror is fogless is the same sense that whales can stay dry if they simply stay out of the ocean! The instructions tell you to run the mirror under the shower water, front and back, so the mirror will be the same temp as the water and prevent fogging.  Well that works, for a little while, then it fogs. Do you notice water spots on the mirror shown on the packaging? I don&#x27;t. Of course that&#x27;s what you get, unless you happen to have a shower squeegee handy (sold separately). I did figure out one way to keep it from fogging. Cold shower! Now we are all HAPPY!</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror to replace a little handheld one that I took from an LL Bean kit, but which went missing on my last move. It does exactly what it says it does. Small enough not to take up too much space, doesn&#x27;t risk throwing shards of glass all over the shower floor if it does happen to fall, heats up quickly under the shower stream and stays clear long enough to shave. In that, it&#x27;s a perfect tool. I don&#x27;t know that I agree with the idea on the sticker, which is to use toothpaste to clean it. My toothpaste is a little abrasive, but I&#x27;ve always found that buffing the dry mirror against a towel does the job just fine. Good product, good price.</li>
    <li> Some of the negative reviews concerned me, but I bought this mirror anyway. I&#x27;m glad I did. The mirror no longer comes with any type of adhesive, so that is no longer a problem. The included hook has double sided tape, but I decided to use a \\&quot;3M Command\\&quot; hook instead. [[ASIN:B001B1VWTA Command 17068 Medium Wire Hooks, 2 Hooks 4 Strips]] The comments about the mirror being too narrow are not correct - it is just fine. It fogs up a bit after a while, but a quick rinse under the shower water fixes that right up. I suppose some people expect absolute perfection, but I find this mirror just fine.</li>
    <li> Mirror only stays fog free for maybe 2 minutes, before I have to re-warm.  I still gave it 3 stars because it&#x27;s cheap, doesn&#x27;t use suction cups (which I don&#x27;t like), and works ok.</li>
    <li> At first I thought it was too small when I first opened it up  But once I mounted it, it turns out to be Perfect!  At first I was skeptical about the sticky mount vs a suction one but now I am really glad I chose this one.   2 things to remember  REMOVE the shipping film on the front(some people I dont think realized it was there, its incredibly hard to find an edge, but if its not 100% crystal clear, its still on there)  second, if its fogging up at all, then you didn&#x27;t follow the directions.  If you are having a rather hot shower with lots of fog, you need to run the mirror under the hot water for a little while first,  then just shake the loose water off and I never have any problems whatsoever, I&#x27;ve had it for over a month now.</li>
    <li> This is not TRULY fog free. In fact its not even a little fog free. I have it in my shower and clean it regularly with toothpaste but I cannot use it when I have hot water going. I dont understand how the manufacturer can claim that its fog free and how Amazon allows them to make such false claims. Moreover, the product is cheaply finished. The edges are razor sharp. I had to run a sharp knife over the sides to take the edge off.</li>
    <li> Had I seen this in the store, I would NOT have shelled out $10 for it.  The size is listed on the page, but either I didn&#x27;t see the size before I ordered or the dimensions didn&#x27;t register when I read them.  I would have preferred something a tad bit larger, although I obviously don&#x27;t need a medicine cabinet-sized mirror in the shower just to shave.  However, the mirror works and it works just fine.  Hitting it with some water for a couple seconds took care of any \\&quot;fog\\&quot; that appeared during my first use.  I didn&#x27;t mount the hook yet and don&#x27;t know if I will.  It&#x27;s leaning on a ledge in the shower which seems to work fine as I held the mirror in my hand while I shaved.  It is very lightweight due to it being a very thin  I was able to get the closest shave I can remember in years.  This should not be specifically attributed to the mirror, though.  It&#x27;s the first time I even SHAVED in the shower in God knows how long...  As an aside, the company sent an email directly to me with a few instructions.  Now, I&#x27;m not a rube and can follow directions if they&#x27;re in/on the box.  While I understand the principle of customer service behind an email, buying from Amazon and having the 3rd-party company shoot out an email with directions for use and an explanation of how fog works struck me as...well, odd.</li>
    <li> So I have a very old-fashioned bathtub, one of those classic clawfoot designs not built into the wall. Due to this, there are shower curtains on all sides, and no access to the walls for a suction cup mirror. I needed a simple, small shower mirror I could hang on one of my shower curtain hooks. This mirror fit the bill perfectly. It&#x27;s so lightweight, doesn&#x27;t put any strain whatsoever on the hooks.  It works exactly as described, and is a very good size to hold in your hand while shaving. It looks small initially, but in reality the size is perfect, as an inch wider would have made holding it far more uncomfortable with one hand.  It&#x27;s an odd product that feels very cheaply made (due to the light weight of the acrylic used), but really serves the intended purpose perfectly.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the great reviews and cheap price.  I&#x27;m glad I purchased this mirror; just follow the provided instructions when installing and you&#x27;ll be fine.  You will have to hold the mirror under the shower head to keep the mirror from fogging, however, this is to be expected.  Overall, it&#x27;s a simple no-thrills shower mirror that does stay mostly fog free..</li>
    <li> The thing is, it is hard to keep this thing water free after you warm it up. Water beads up and makes it tough to see what you are doing. This isn&#x27;t a huge problem if you are old enough to basically know what you need to do to your face, but it might be tough if you really rely on that mirror to see what you are doing. I shake it and wipe it off, but I still end up with water so I just make do.</li>
    <li> The product is exactly as described in the ad and it arrived sooner than I expected. At first I was skeptical that it would work as described because it is so simple - just a mirror and a little hook. I followed the easy instructions and I have been pleased and satisfied from day one. Holding the mirror in the flow of warm/hot water for a few seconds, one time, usually gets me through the entire shave. This product is one of the best items I have purchased from Amazon because it is so simple and works so well. If I lost it I would buy another one in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> The mirror is 6\\&quot; x 4\\&quot;.  Although I knew the size was smaller than I wanted from the description, it still gets the job done.  I would love to see a 7\\&quot; x 5\\&quot; size offered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror weighs very little and because of this it is very unlikely to break when dropped, and less likely to cause the included hook to come unglued from tile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Running the mirror under heated water will keep it fog free for the time required to shave.  I haven&#x27;t tried cleaning it with toothpaste (see many of the comments sections), but will try that to decrease the water droplets that are unavoidable in a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hung the shave mirror at a height where the hook was at my nose level.  Give it some thought before you hang the mirror, because once its done, its done. Make sure you can comfortably get a good view of the areas you will be shaving, especially your neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things that could improve this item:  The mirror includes 1 hook that has a glue backing.  Including an extra one for someone who later decides that he hung the hook at the wrong height or has 2 showers would be a real bonus.  Including a suction cup type hook (along with, not instead of the glue backed hook) will help travelers and those who don&#x27;t want a permanent hook in their shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With those things said, I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> It is as described and works well.  Only con is no place to hold razor.  Easy to set up and use.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for about a year. For the money, it is the best you can buy. It is NOT perfect as, if you follow the directions, you have about five minutes before it starts to fog again. Plenty of time to shave. If you have to have a perfectly fog-free mirror all the time, the only mirrors that I have used that do not fog up at all are the ones that divert water from the showerhead and run it continuously behind the mirror. However, they are costly and use water. This one works great for a quick shave and the price is right. I recomment it highly.</li>
    <li> While it doesn&#x27;t live up to it&#x27;s claim of &#x27;fogless&#x27;, because it does indeed fog up, it serves its purpose once some water is run over it.</li>
    <li> This is the shower mirror is the last one you will ever buy -- until you buy one for the rest of your friends and family!  There is nothing extravagant about this mirror, but that is not a problem at all to me.  You simply place a Command Strip hook in your shower and then hang the mirror.  Each time you shower, hold the mirror under the water for 30 sec to warm it up.  Once the mirror is no longer cool, it will not fog.  Great touch from the supplier for contacting me after the sale to make sure I was happy.</li>
    <li> This mirror is great, just run it under the shower before shaving to warm it up to the water temp and it will stay fog free for the entire shave! Also very durable and slim so it is easy to take along when away from home.</li>
    <li> Lasted about a month and a half before mirror delaminated.  Tried to return it but it was two weeks past the return period.  If you are considering this product, just take your money and throw it directly into the trash.  End result is the same.</li>
    <li> This mirror is lightweight and sturdy and hangs on a hook, so you can take it off and hold it or leave it on the wall. I place it on the shower floor for a minute to warm it up, and it stays fog-free for about five minutes. It works perfectly. The service provided by this company is superb.</li>
    <li> Here is the thing, shaving in the shower is awesome but it can be tricky when you are looking at your reflection in the the shampoo bottle. I needed a mirror that wasn&#x27;t to hard on the old money sack. I thought I would give this one a whirl. It works but it is always getting streaky. I doubt there are to many that are better but what are you going to do.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday.  I have tried other mirrors from OXO and wouldn&#x27;t go back.  I didn&#x27;t follow the directions on hanging the hook on my porcelain tile and it fell off when I tried to immediately use it.  Shave Well generously sent me a replacement hook and I&#x27;ve never had another issue.  The suction cup works well for travel.  I take it everywhere I go overnight.</li>
    <li> CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR MY NEPHEW, WHO LOVES IT.  HE SHAVES IN THE SHOWER.  USES IT EVERDAY.  EASY TO PLACE TOO.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a 5 year old, attach it to outlet mirror, that was going bad. I didn&#x27;t want another of the same type because it was so bulky. I figured for the low price I would give it a shot. Well it just works! Simple to put on, simple to see and simple to get a great shave. I am very happy with this item and the personal care the company gives to make sure you are happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m primarily writing this review because it&#x27;s obvious, to me, that this company really wants your business and is willing to earn it. Why?  1. They made a very functional (i.e. does what it claims to do) fog-less mirror. This is most important!  2. After you purchase, they send you a reminder email to make sure you hold it under the shower water for a few seconds to warm it up - so it works correctly. This helps insure customer satisfaction.  3. They send you an email after a month or so and request you do a product review (such as this) - literally banking on the idea that you&#x27;re a satisfied customer. How many companies have had enough confidence in their product to solicit a review from you that will be seen by the public???  The mirror works great - and if I start traveling again I may buy another to keep in my suitcase....</li>
    <li> This company provides EXCELLENT service. Mirror works well, and Bill Vogel, the VP, responded promptly and with a smile to my contact. I am so happy I can shave after my shower now. It&#x27;s so much easier rinsing your face in the shower. No more messy sink!</li>
    <li> Fell off wall twice so far, must keep wet to avoid fogging, otherwise it fogs terribly.</li>
    <li> This mirror actually works!!  I&#x27;ve tried different products in the past only to be annoyed or disappointed by suction cups or mirrors not actuallly fo free. After trying this one, I have to say that I&#x27;m really pleased. I was skeptical at first until I saw another review about the mirror. I placed the mirror in the water for a few seconds to let it heat up. The mirror was absolutely fog free...and no suction cups!! My only issue was the adhesive strip that came with the mirror. I didn&#x27;t want to place it on the shower wall only to be hard to remove later. Instead, I used one of those easy to move 3M strips I found around the house. No stress on the hook because the mirror is really light! Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!</li>
    <li> This is the best shower mirror we have tried. It still fogs up a bit but wipes easily with one swipe for a clear reflection. Hanger has not fallen off since we put it up.</li>
    <li> This mirror has been a lifesaver! I no longer have ridiculous irritation from shaving. My barber told me to start shaving in the shower and after research I settled on this mirror. I could not be happier with the mirror and will never shave again unless I&#x27;m in the shower.</li>
    <li> Works very well if used as directed.  I don&#x27;t use the adhesive hook but prefer to hold it and it&#x27;s light weight works very well.  Highly recommended for those shower shavers!</li>
    <li> Great razors great idea!</li>
    <li> I have had it about a month now.  It works exactly as advertised.  It does accumulate little droplet spots over time, but they rinse off with the shower spray.  I love not having suction cups holding it and being able to rinse it easily when needed.</li>
    <li> As you confront your morning stubble&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s usually one thing that is trouble&lt;br /&gt;As you rush through morning hour&lt;br /&gt;You want to shave while in the shower&lt;br /&gt;Hot water turns your beard to down&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll cut it close, be fit for town&lt;br /&gt;But physics&#x27; laws now intervene&lt;br /&gt;You cannot keep your mirror clean&lt;br /&gt;Here you stand with face all creamy&lt;br /&gt;Alas, the mirror&#x27;s fogged and steamy&lt;br /&gt;Happily with Shave Well&#x27;s device&lt;br /&gt;You can see before you slice&lt;br /&gt;The whiskers from your lovely face&lt;br /&gt;A mug that&#x27;s smooth in every place</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband but have found myself using it to groom my eyebrows while showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I read the directions I found my husband had improperly placed the 2 sided sticky thing for the hook so it wouldn&#x27;t stick. Lucky for me I had a small \\&quot;Command Hook\\&quot; that worked beautifully! (We placed the mirror on same wall as shower head) I did use one of those magic erasers to clean any soap scum off &amp; wiped some rubbing alcohol over the target area prior to placing hook &amp; mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband loves the shower mirror &amp; it&#x27;s fogless capability, especially since all our past shower mirrors were unable to achieve that feat!</li>
    <li> Have tried and tossed out several shower mirrors that claimed to be fog free.  The Shave Well Fog Free is the first that fits the bill</li>
    <li> Not works as expected</li>
    <li> This thing is a lot smaller than I expected for the price, I would have preferred something sturdier as well.</li>
    <li> UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;The Shave Well Company customer service responded very quickly to my talk with Amazon customer service and/or this review.  I was shipped out two mirrors for the two defective ones that were shipped to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word of advice: if you have the mirror placed against tile then heat the tile up with hot water.  This prohibits fog from developing as the tile is cold whereas the mirror is warm if you follow directions.&lt;br /&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;br /&gt;This product says what it tries to accomplish, be fog free.  If does reduce the amount of fog it takes on; however, it is not truly fogless.  A particular issue of concern is a defect in the product which results in what appears to be the backing of the mirror peeling off, as in bubbling of sorts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> All I use is hot water and my razor.  This little gem works perfectly for getting the job done.  Shaving is a very relaxing experience now.</li>
    <li> I held off a little while on writing a review on this mirror because I have had several similar mirrors in the past that started off well, but quickly stopped being fog free.  This little mirror truly is fog free and is the best of it&#x27;s kind that I have had.  You simply wet the front and back of the mirror when you get in the shower and you are good to go.  It hangs on a little hook that sticks to the shower (like on of those command hooks with the sticky back).  This has worked better than the suction cup type of hanger for me.  My only wish is that it had a little hook for a razor, but I can&#x27;t really even complain about that.  It does just what it says it does.  Well worth the money (actually it is pretty cheap, so probably more than worth the money)</li>
    <li> I love to shave in the shower and have been disappointed with past &#x27;fogless&#x27; mirrors I&#x27;ve purchased.  But this one is too simple to mess up.  Hook sticks to the wall, mirror hangs on the hook.  Just put both sides under hot water and you&#x27;re set long enough to shave.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a shower shaver for years &amp; had many types of fog free mirrors. This one is my favorite since it&#x27;s so easy to use and stays fog free so well. A big bonus is that I can either hold it in my hand, or leave it hanging on the wall....which is a better flexibility than trying to bend my neck like Gumby to see under my chin and take advantage of the limited lighting in my shower by reflecting the light do I can see better. Just buy one. You&#x27;ll use it every day.</li>
    <li> I bought this shower mirror for my husband to use while shaving because the previous one I bought didn&#x27;t work well at all. We&#x27;ve only had this a few days, but so far, it works pretty well after you follow the instructions and run both sides under the warm water for a few seconds. It works long enough for him to shave at least. Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> This mirror works if you follow the instructions for use. I would have given 5 stars if they would have packaged the mirror with a better hook to hang the mirror on in the shower.  The mirror comes with a hook and some double sided 3m type tape that lasted 3 days in the shower.  The hook should have a suction cup on the back and it would hold great. I am having a hard time finding a hook that will allow me to use this mirror again.</li>
    <li> This is the worst shower mirror I have ever used.  It shouldn&#x27;t come with a 30 page manual.  It isn&#x27;t fog free and I would like a refund for wasting my time trying to figure out how to use this mirror rather than shaving.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s crystal clear, sized perfectly and truly does not fog up at all.  Wow!  This shaving mirror is simply the best.  Ask Tina Turner for the full review.</li>
    <li> The photos are misleading. I didn&#x27;t read the tech specs. It is a tiny mirror for the money.  I am sending this back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this mirror for about a year and a half, and I&#x27;d have to say it&#x27;s one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made. I don&#x27;t write many reviews (I should do more), so that alone says something about how satisfied I am with this product. Here&#x27;s the gist:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works as advertised. All I need to do is hold it under the shower for 10-15 seconds, and it stays completely clear for at least 10 minutes - more than enough time for me. If I need even more, I just stick it back under;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s consistently provided a clear image - kinda critical when it comes to nick-free shaving. When it occasionally gets spotty - maybe every few months - I just rub a little toothpaste onto it (as directed by the manufacturer) with my fingers, rinse it off, and it&#x27;s as clear as the day I got it;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size is perfect, at least for me. I worried, when I took it out of the box, that it would be too small. But I see my entire shaving area with my nose practically touching it, so it&#x27;s large enough to get as close as I need to while still getting the &amp;#34;big picture.&amp;#34; But it&#x27;s small and light enough that the adhesive hook stays put. It was frustrating to have to pick up my last mirror every time the suction cups gave out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it in a nutshell. I wish every product I purchased was as spot on and reliable as this one&#x27;s been.</li>
    <li> Title says it all.  This product works as advertised and meets my expectations.  It doesn&#x27;t fog and it&#x27;s also easy to clean with a little toothpaste.</li>
    <li> This is literally just a hook you put on the shower wall and hang the mirror on it.  This is truely fogless.  All you do is take the mirror off of the hook, run it under the warm water and the mirror won&#x27;t fog up for the rest of the shower.  If you have good lighting in your bathroom/shower this mirror is the best thing you could buy.</li>
    <li> The mirror is very small and pretty cheap.  It&#x27;s basically a small piece of shaped plastic with a reflective coating on the rear.  I noticed yesterday this reflective coating is already coming off in places.  That means in a few months I&#x27;m going to have to toss this \\&quot;mirror\\&quot; and peel this hanger of the shower wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I would NOT exactly call this \\&quot;Truly Fog Free\\&quot;.  The instruction say to run the mirror under the water to prevent it from fogging up.  Basically you heat the mirror to the temperature of the water and so long as it stays that temperature it will not fog.  This method is true for any mirror.  BUT, this mirror does still collect water droplets on the surface so you still can see the reflection all that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might buy this again if it cost 1 dollar and came with free shipping just so I didn&#x27;t have to peel the hanger off the shower wall but that would be the only way.</li>
    <li> I had to return the first mirror because the sticky hanger wasn&#x27;t sticky. The customer service got back to me immediately and offered a replacement. They were very courteous, understanding and polite - rare qualities in customer service nowadays.&lt;br /&gt;The second mirror I received works perfect!&lt;br /&gt;Overall a pleasant experience and quality product.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Well,&lt;br /&gt;I had an old sharper image showertek mirror, no longer worked well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replaced with a generic suction cup shaving mirror from Bed Bath and Beyond.  Worked for a few weeks and broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, I have been using this mirror and have been enjoying it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple and no-fuss, like previous ones I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Bill!  Great product.</li>
    <li> I purchased the mirror because of all the positive reviews it had recieved. When I recieved the mirror I realized it was quite small but was still willing to give it a shot. The compactness and the fact that you can take it off the hanger to put it in the water to defog it makes it really nice and it still gives you enough mirror to be able to shave well with it. It came with some scratches in the lower right corner and when the company emailed me I told them about the scratches and they sent me a replacement immediately that was in perfect shape. I am really satisified with the mirror and especially the customer service help which really showed they cared about the quality of their product and customer satifaction. I would highly recommend this mirror to anyone.</li>
    <li> I read all these reviews and none of them is anything more than opinion. How about just stateing that the mirror is made of some kind of plastic, not breakable glass. It comes with a convient wall mounted hook which is easily removed by pulling a tab and sticking on a clean mounting surface to support the hanging mirror. The mirror has a protective coating of plastic sheeting that must be removed so that it can be used to reflect your image clearly and properly (this is on the side with all of the writing on it).The mirror is heated with hot shower water to keep it fog free for a couple of minutes. Some people consider it a bit small, so did I at first, but it does magnify and it can be turned 90 degrees to give a wider view. I soon got over it and appreciated the usefullness of the mirror. It will be a great travel shaving mirror. Enough of the baloney in these reviews. Everyone is a technical writer. .. NOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards, Pag</li>
    <li> The mirror is small, but is the exact dimensions from the website and is truly fog free.  My husband loves it!</li>
    <li> After reading other reviews, I thought the mirror might be too small. Ends up it works just fine. Size is perfect for my needs. Will fog up after awhile but just rinse under water and your good to go again. You may have to rinse a couple of times, big deal! I like the mirror and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I have used \\&quot;fog-free\\&quot; shower mirrors for 20+ years. The fog-free coating always disappears within 3 months. This product really works! And for those that have a concern over the size, I find it fine-I leave it hanging up, although you can hold it in the other hand while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company followed up with an email to make sure that I was satisfied. I was very satisfied, but I screwed up the hanger installation (not a design flaw, I tried to install on a curved surface &amp; knocked off the hook when I cleaned the shower). They immediately offered to send a new hanger!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am buying a home with 4 baths, and I will order this mirror for each bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! And I promise that I don&#x27;t work for this company..</li>
    <li> I bought this shaving mirror over a week now. And I have to say I&#x27;m very disappointed in the size of the mirror. I thought it would be a lot larger and I&#x27;ve a problem with water droplet collecting on the mirror making it hard to see when you shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> So I mean it&#x27;s a decent mirror -- nothing special, but it didn&#x27;t stick to my shower after about 4 months and it never was fogless. Maybe I take really hot showers? But I kinda thought fogless meant fogless regardless of the temperature.</li>
    <li> The mirror is ok I was dissapointed in the size I would like something a little bigger.  It is fog free when you do as suggested.</li>
    <li> Great mirror, just warm it up to keep the fog off, when it fogs up again, as it will eventually in the shower, just run some hot water on the back and front of it again</li>
    <li> I own a large shower the size of a small bathroom and so I have it hanging. IT tends to fog up rather quickly once I turn up the heat. I understand it would get foggy and it would get wet like everything else does, but theres no reason why it would fog up like the way it does. I have to actually wet it and let it warm up the to the temperature so it can work for a little. Than it gets foggy again and again. I have to use my hands to wipe it a few times till its the temp of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a nice, but maybe not the best for bigger showers.</li>
    <li> A little smaller than I would have liked but still works</li>
    <li> This item just arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing that struck me, is that it is A LOT SMALLER than I imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s fog free or not.  I&#x27;m guessing that it probably works.  I haven&#x27;t found out yet, because I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m keeping it or not.  I honestly can&#x27;t imagine using it to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check the size before you order it, and make sure it will be OK with you</li>
    <li> This mirror does what it says and hangs nicely in the shower. No regrets. It&#x27;s the perfect size and shape too.</li>
    <li> A few years ago I was gifted a shower shaving mirror and have been hooked on shaving in the shower ever since. As compared to the old shave-over-the-bathroom-sink method, the steamy shower environment really seems to make the shaving experience smoother, faster and much less painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That first shower mirror was the type held to the wall by a couple suction cups... and those cups became hard and lost their grip in about six months.  After that I tried a different mirror with four suction cups, and that one lasted about one year... actually had two of those in a row. Still, it would have been nice not to have had to purchase a replacement every nine to 12 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple months ago I went looking for a longer-term replacement, and reviews of this Shave Well shaving mirror seems to indicate that it might be exactly what was needed. I made the purchase and would say that those reviews were right on the mark; am very happy with this item&#x27;s functionality and mirrored surface, and offer the following for your consideration:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Following instruction, I cleaned the shower wall very well and then allowed more than the noted 1 hour for the wall to dry&lt;br /&gt;* Mounted the mirror&#x27;s hook on the clean wall and allowed the adhesion to bond overnight before hanging the mirror&lt;br /&gt;* I shave near shower&#x27;s end by applying shaving gel, running the mirror under the water, hanging the mirror, and shaving&lt;br /&gt;* Putting the mirror under the water too early gave it time to cool, and fog returned. I now wait until ready to shave&lt;br /&gt;* Before leaving the shower I&#x27;ll shake the mirror to remove excess water, and might pat it once, not rub it, with the towel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I learned with the first few mirrors was how not to clean water spots from them... the first couple times I tried using dish soap and a scrubber sponge or a washcloth, and basically destroyed the mirrored finish on these things. None of the shower &#x27;mirrors&#x27; I have owned have actually been made of a glass mirror; instead, they seem to be made by applying a thin mirrored finished to a plastic or plexiglass backing.  That finish is fairly easy to damage, so some care is needed when trying to clean them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For whatever reason (maybe she read the instructions...) my wife suggested using toothpaste and that has worked quite well. For us, the paste type toothpaste works better than the gel type; we just apply a small dab or two, lightly rub the toothpaste around the mirror in small circles using the pad of our finger (not the fingernail), and then rinse it all off with warm water. Works amazingly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few months use - so far, so good. This mirror has been excellent and easy to use. If you are looking for a mirror for use similar to what I&#x27;ve expressed above, and looking for a product that will do the job without breaking the bank, then I highly recommend this too you. If issues are experienced in less than a year, I will return to make appropriate updates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommendeden made of a glass mirror; instead, they seem to be made by applying a thin mirrored finished to a plastic or plexiglass backing.

    <li> Lesson learned....always check product dimensions before ordering! I laughed when I opened the box and saw how small this mirror is.  This is not a shower mirror.  I can&#x27;t believe the cost is $9 for this tiny little mirror.</li>
    <li> I bought this with the H2Oral Irrigator, so my kids could see what they are doing.  This does not fog up when the shower is running.  Great for use in the shower.</li>
    <li> I hate to give 5 stars until i have had the product for several years but i felt i had to offset some of the bad reviews. First, it is NOT a dull mirror. It has a film on it and you take it off. Looks like a mirror. If it looks dull and you pulled that off, return it and get a new one. Yes it takes prep to keep it from fogging as much, but is good for shaving. If a few drops are on the mirror, and that is bothering you, maybe you shouldnt try doing open heart surgery in the shower. Yes there are water drops on the mirror, but all im concerned about is seeing if im shaving the right areas. I don&#x27;t think a few drops of water will make me end up accidentally slitting my throat because i learned to shave in front of a mirror that didnt have water drops so maybe i dont know what im talking about. However, if you are an adult, you should be ok with this mirror. It hangs up wherever you want, you have to run it under some water before using it, and as long as it doesnt take you 10 minutes to shave, it shouldnt be fogged up before you are done! If it holds up for more than 6 months, ill try and give it the 5 stars.</li>
    <li> My husband loves, loves, loves this mirror. I gave it to him as a gift. He had no problems using it. He said he holds it under the shower for a couple of seconds, and that tempers it so it doesn&#x27;t fog.</li>
    <li> This is the best fog-less mirror I have ever tried. I have used almost every one of the Z&#x27;Fogless mirrors and they simply do not work after week or so. I was constantly spraying and soaping it up just to keep it from fogging--they were always a hassle and eventually had to be replaced. No joke, I probably spent close to $200 on Z&#x27;Fogless mirrors over the years.    This is brilliant, in that it works. No need to use special sprays, just science. It is also perfectly sized and does not use suction cups (so no crashes in the night). At first, I thought it may be too small--but you will realize the size is also perfect, once you start using it.    Highly, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for - a safe, non-breakable mirror for my toddler to use in the tub so he can look at his crazy shampoo-hair-do&#x27;s.  (And I didn&#x27;t want a cutesie baby-looking one.)  This one is great!  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 months now, and it pretty much lives up to its billing.  It&#x27;s a good size, doesn&#x27;t fall off the wall of my shower, functions as well as one can expect, is cheap enough, and also works well for travel.  Is it COMPLETELY fog-free?  No, but following their instructions does keep it fog-free for a good 5+ minutes.  After that, it only fogs up a touch towards the end of my shave, and even then that doesn&#x27;t get in the way of my shave.  If I need to, just letting the water from the shower run over it for a second or two takes care of any fog for the next 5 or so minutes.    Highly recommended for those looking for a shower shave mirror.</li>
    <li> The key to this product is its simplicity.  It does stay fog free but if it does fog up, unlike other products that are mounted to the wall via suction cups or some other method, this mirror is easily removed and put under the shower head.  I don&#x27;t know how long other guys are in the shower shaving, but I don&#x27;t need lights, radios, etc.  I just needed a way to see my face while I shaved.  This works.</li>
    <li> Only have this mirror for a couple weeks, but it seems to be worth the money. Nothing fancy...just a mirror and sticky hook to hang it on. Fogging has not been an issue so far.  ** UPDATE 10/29/11 **  This turned out to be a real clunker. The sticky hook fell of the wall within 2 weeks and the mirror fogs beyond use. Pretty worthless item. Look elsewhere.  ** UPDATE 12/11/11 **  The Seller of this item sent me a new hook and some tips on how to properly use this mirror and how to avoid fogging or condensation build up. They sent this to me unsolicited! You don&#x27;t get that kind of excellent Customer Service very often....very impressive!</li>
    <li> I see other reviewers complaining about the size. I can see my face in it, it&#x27;s totally unobtrusive in the shower and it does work. I&#x27;ve had many shave mirrors and they always end up getting foggy or getting water stains. This one is great as I can quickly take it off the hook and towel dry it right after the shower. No spots! Also you can put other hooks in the shower if you need a better spot or even outside the shower. The mobility is what makes it better than the other mirrors and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I thought about getting one of these for a while now but never got around to it as it&#x27;s not really a necessity. My wife bought me one for christmas so I finally got one. Turns out that its basically just a piece of mirrored acrylic that has been laser cut to the right size with a hole in the center for mounting. I guess you could make or build your own but I doubt it would be cheaper. Because it is acrylic it takes less time to reach temperature equilibrium than glass would. If you drop it thats no problem either. I ended up clipping mine to my existing shower organizer thing and it works great.</li>
    <li> for the price dose the job well</li>
    <li> As long as you keep the instructions in mind when your mirror begins to fog up, then  this will be a good investment.</li>
    <li> The mirror works very well. I particularly like the fact you can remove it from the hook and use it anywhere in the shower.</li>
    <li> While the mirror was smaller than I was expecting, the product was easy to order, arrived quickly and works great. It was my fault for not paying closer attention to the measurements that were provided, but as it turns out, it is a great size as well.</li>
    <li> Update: Truly great customer care from the guys, they pay attention and come to help. They shipped me a replacement for a failed hook free of charge and that is a great customer care! Recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror without a a hook is pointless, I cleaned with alcohol, pressed for 30 secs, let it dry overnight and still it came undone in the first 15 mins of shaving. Note it was attached to a regular flat glass, so not sure what the problem is. It should be designed to stay glued in the showers, right? Disappointed for $10USD.</li>
    <li> Does fog a little, but simply take off hook and run a little water over it and it works great. Small shower with plenty of steam and product does its job in order to shave in the morning.</li>
    <li> This thing works great! It&#x27;s light-weight, easy to clean, and easy to take with you on trips. The anti-fog technique works just fine. If you start seeing smudges and spots on the mirror, just rinse it off with your fingers. What a clever idea!</li>
    <li> If you follow the directions, this mirror works great and has been hanging happily in my shower with the included hook for over a month now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To those people complaining that it fogs up, READ THE DIRECTIONS. They very clearly state that you should run the mirror under the hot water to bring it up to temp for it not to fog.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this mirror for a little over a year. I couldn&#x27;t get it to hang on the wall (I may not have cleaned the wall well enough), so I used a computer cable tie to hang it from one of the shower curtain rings, which works ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problem with the mirror is that the reflective coating has been coming off for at least a couple weeks now, to the point that the mirror is hardly usable. The mirror is cheap, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s intended to be disposable, and that&#x27;s not what the environment needs. Apparently this is not common problem, though, based on the reviews. Maybe mine is defective.</li>
    <li> It actually DOES fog up, and the finish is peeling off the corners a bit, but it is still a handy lightweight shower mirror so I&#x27;ve got no problems with it.  Just swipe it with your hand and it doesn&#x27;t fog up again for a while.  The stick on hook it came with is still working just fine as well.</li>
    <li> Fogs up...Yeah.&lt;br /&gt;So not Truly fog free. I&#x27;m not giving it one star because I should&#x27;ve known better as an engineering student that no mirror is fog-free unless it matches the temp of the water/steam. Just run it under hot water and you&#x27;ll be solid. that&#x27;s a pain though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve paid twice the price for shower mirrors and have half the value of this mirror. It&#x27;s simple to use, it stays on the wall like it&#x27;s supposed to and most importantly IT WORKS</li>
    <li> \\&quot;This thing is not at all a good value and I don&#x27;t understand all the great ratings. It&#x27;s a cheap, tiny plastic mirror. Not at all fog free as claimed. It fogs up constantly. The \\&quot;fogless design\\&quot; is you putting it under the shower stream. Save your money, not even worth one star.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used all kinds of fog-free mirrors and have had problems with them all.  Not this one. It works great! Hold it for just a couple of seconds under the shower and put in back on its hook. Fogfree for all the time it takes me to shower.  Yes, it&#x27;s small, but it shows my full face. Yes, it&#x27;s plastic, but so what? It gives a clear reflection. It works. The hook is held with a normal adhesive that has worked perfectly for me. The company is very communicative and interested in their customers. Incredibly good customer service, but you don&#x27;t really need customer service. This product is so easy to use.  Don&#x27;t go for the fancy, electric stuff and mirrors that inevitably fog up. Go for the simple kind that just works. This is it.</li>
    <li> It is a great product!  This fogless mirror is truly fogless!  I travel extensively, so I bought two fogless mirrors and plan to take one mirror on the road with me.  When I used the fogless mirror for the first time, I was thinking it would be awkward holding the mirror in one hand while shaving, it wasn&#x27;t.  If you have second thoughts of what fogless mirror to purchase...don&#x27;t, buy this product.  You would have made the right decision.</li>
    <li> I love the simplicity of this product. It works as described and is easy to install. It is the perfect size for me. The larger mirrors take up too much space, didn&#x27;t work as well and don&#x27;t look as nice in the shower. Tip: if you have a low flow shower head hold the mirror under the water a tiny bit longer to heat it up so it doesn&#x27;t fog. The customer service is also remarkable. The owner (Bill) is extremely helpful and wants the customer to be happy.</li>
    <li> A truly great product. I have been looking for a mirror that works in the shower for 44 years. I&#x27;ve tried them all.  This one works!  The product is simple in design, well documented, and affordable, and seems to be backed with great customer service.  The design includes a well thought out hook, and the alcohol pad, needed for mounting, is included.  Small details, well thought out.  The trick is to read the directions.  I bought this on he shave well website.  I find the larger size one great for my needs.  P. L. Dion, Conn.</li>
    <li> The mirror works well.  It&#x27;s true for me that it fogs up, but the hook makes it easy to run under the water and continue shaving.  It&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo23WHHWZNJOGLG]]The Shave Well mirror really works! I color my hair and when I return from the hair dresser I need to remove the color stain around my hair line. The easiest way to do it is in the hot shower. Before this little handy mirror I would just scrub blindly, now I can see where the scrubbing is needed so the job gets done much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am attaching a collage of 4 photos that I will be referencing in this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Photo #1: The mirror comes with a hook that you attached to the shower wall with a double sticky tape. I have a single piece shower stall to which it adhered very well. I have had the mirror in the shower for a week and it still solidly on. The mirror is very light so it does not put a lot of stress on the hook. I find the hook to be a more reliable mechanism than a suction cup, as those occasionally do come off. And I like that I can take the mirror off very easily.&lt;br /&gt;2. Photo #2: The mirror comes with a protective film over the glass. The film is white and you cannot see through it. Once you remove it the mirror is very clear and the reflection is high quality.&lt;br /&gt;The mirror is sized 6\\&quot; by 4\\&quot; and the glass has no magnification.&lt;br /&gt;3. Photo #3: The mirror is very light, it weighs only 1.7 ounces&lt;br /&gt;4. Photo #4: The back of the mirror is covered with thin thermal coating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fog forms on mirrors because of condensation. The water in shower is warmer than the air in the house, it warms the air in the bathroom and condensates on any cool surfaces such as mirrors. If you hold this thin mirror under water for 10 seconds to warm it up condensation does not form on the glass until the mirror cools off. I measured that it stayed fog free for about 13 minutes, then a quick dip into the hot shower and it was fog free again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best place to position the mirror is away from drafts that will quicken its cooling, and away from direct shower spray to minimize water spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very pleased with the mirror and recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia reviewvery pleased with the mirror and recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
    <li> What a great value.  This is the best shower mirror I&#x27;ve used.  Pretty large field of view, nice and light, easy to rinse, pretty strong.  I&#x27;ve dropped it a few times without apparent ill effect.  After a month of use, the silvering on the mirror is starting to come off along the bottom edge, but it will have to get a lot worse to make any difference.  At this price point, I&#x27;m very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of caution--the included hanging hook is permanent and nearly impossible to remove.  I placed it too low, and don&#x27;t use it--instead, I use an inexpensive suction-cup hook, which I like better.  That also makes it easy to travel with the mirror.</li>
    <li> Convenient little mirror, holding the mirror upright it is 4 inches in width and 6 inches in height. It is a little small but I really wasn&#x27;t expecting anything more.  It IS fog free but you need to warm up the mirror first so that it matches the temperature in the shower (this prevents condensation, also known as fog for most of you). The edges are a little sharp and I did end up cutting myself by mistake (I did apply quite a bit of force for this to happen, it&#x27;s not like I just slid my finger against it and I was sliced). I&#x27;d recommend filing down the sides but then again you really won&#x27;t be holding the mirror so no biggie.  I only needed a small mirror so I could see which spots I missed when shaving, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> Excellent mirror.  Not huge, but that&#x27;s ok.  It&#x27;s super easy to clean, excellent reflection, and it does not fog at all.  If it does, just hold it under the warm water for a moment and you&#x27;re good!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s advertised as &amp;#34;fog free&amp;#34;, yet they&#x27;ve done nothing to make it so. Basically, they just tell you to run it under the shower water to get the mirror to match the ambient temperature.</li>
    <li> Follow the directions and you will be happy with this mirror. Got it this morning and just tried it out. Works like a charm!</li>
    <li> Works if you follow directions. Had it for a year now.</li>
    <li> Not &amp;#34;fog free&amp;#34;.. You have to run it under the water several times during a shave session in the shower.</li>
    <li> Mirror is a piece of junk! Mirror finish wearing off after 2 months! Do not waste your money, get one from Walmart.</li>
    <li> There is no mechanism that make this mirror fogless. How it is truly fogless?&lt;br /&gt;You have to warm it up with warm water everytime you want to use.</li>
    <li> Had to super-glue it to the tile after the mirror collapsed middle of the night.  It is fine, but for 10 bucks should be better or give extra tape for the stick-on hook.  OUCH</li>
    <li> I had been using a handheld mirror to shave with in the shower but that was kind of awkward so I went looking on amazon for something better that I could afix to the shower wall and that wouldn&#x27;t fog up.  Anyway, found this mirror, liked the price and ordered it.  Shipping was super fast and the mirror works great. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Have to rinse it or wash it in order to not be foggy.  Didn&#x27;t find it fog free at all.  I&#x27;ve shaved in the shower for years.  I have bought much better products.</li>
    <li> Got tired of sticking my head out of the shower to use the medicine cabinet mirror while shaving. The mirror works as advertised: put it under the shower water for a few seconds and it won&#x27;t fog up.</li>
    <li> it works but it is really not worth the price. Its a plastic stickon hook and a little square of plastic mirror</li>
    <li> This mirror does stay fog free as long as it stays warm.  I hold both front and back under hot water before hanging it on the wall.  The problem is the material used.  Since it is not glass, it doesn&#x27;t retain heat very well.  Some compromises had to be made for safety.  Why doesn&#x27;t anyone make something like this with a built-in battery powered heater element?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a problem with the mounting hardware coming off the tile (my fault), but the company sent me replacement at no charge.  Great customer service.</li>
    <li> So this mirror is simple, inexpensive and works. I&#x27;ve used it to shave 4 times. It is a bit small to use as a hanging mirror, but its great for holding in your hand while you shave with the other. If you only have one arm then it would be tough. It doesn&#x27;t fog up if you follow directions. Its simple. Run under the water for a few seconds. Then it won&#x27;t fog up. The water does bead up real good on the mirror though and I have to wipe it off every once in a while to keep looking at myself when shaving. I have also used it to look for ticks in my nether regions. A good multi use mirror. I have dropped it and it didn&#x27;t break so that is another good thing. To those who complain that it doesn&#x27;t make you look better, I think that is not one of the specs so you can&#x27;t really judge it based on that.</li>
    <li> if you want a mirror that works in the shower for your shaving/tooth brushing needs, get this, a quick dip in the hot water and you&#x27;re good to go, lightweight, practical, and a non-issue so you can forget about it until you need it.</li>
    <li> This mirror is so tiny!  I should&#x27;ve paid more attention to the dimensions before I ordered it.  It&#x27;s very basic too, just a rectangular piece of glass.  It&#x27;s a Christmas gift for my husband so hopefully it works out.</li>
    <li> Its so simple, its perfect. I just lay it on the ground when I first get in the shower. Then by the time I&#x27;m ready to shave, its already at the proper temperature. It stays fog less for as long as I need it. I would buy this again. 4 stars, only because it is a little small.</li>
    <li> Both guys loved it and haven&#x27;t even tried it yet. Smaller than expected but will travel well too. Good deal I think</li>
    <li> I got tired of the fogless mirrors I&#x27;d used in the past wearing out. Either the coating used to prevent fogging would stop working after a few months, or the suction cups used to hold it on the wall would wear out, or both. At first I was a little wary of the Shave Well, due to a few bad reviews regarding its small size and supposedly not being truly fog-free. But after seeing the worse ratings on more &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; fogless mirrors, and comments explaining how to properly use the Shave Well, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I figured that for the low cost I couldn&#x27;t go too wrong. Well, I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over three months now, and I&#x27;ve got to say it works perfectly. Hold it under the stream of water for a few seconds on each side (as per the instructions), and it stays fog-free more than long enough for me to shave my face. Is the Shave Well small? Yes. But don&#x27;t let its small size fool you. Even standing only a few inches away from it, it&#x27;s _plenty_ big enough to see my whole face as I shave. And all else being equal, I&#x27;d rather have a smaller mirror than a larger one. As a bonus, its small size and light weight makes it practical for me to take with me when I travel, so I can shave in the shower wherever I am, something I&#x27;d wished I&#x27;d been able to do in the past. I&#x27;ve seen some other reviewers complaining about the fact that after you hold it under the water to warm it up there are beads of water on the surface, supposedly preventing them from being able to see well enough to shave. To that all I can say is that yes, a small amount of water beads on the surface, but not in a way that effects the use of the mirror _at_all_. I don&#x27;t get what those other reviewers&#x27; problem was. It&#x27;s simply not an issue. Anyway, the bottom line for me is that the Shave Well is exactly what I was looking for: a fog-free shaving mirror to use in the shower, that I should be able to use for years and years because it doesn&#x27;t rely on a chemical coating that I know from experience will wear out.  UPDATE - 7/24/2013:  Well, it&#x27;s been almost a year and a half of daily use now, and I still love it! My mirror&#x27;s in perfect condition, no problems at all.  UPDATE - 8/3/2014:  Two and a half years of daily use, and still going strong! If it ever does wear out, I&#x27;ll definitely buy another one.  UPDATE - 8/13/2016:  Going on five years of daily use, and still working great. A tiny amount of the reflective coating has worn off near the edges, but otherwise still like new.</li>
    <li> I use this to use in the shower for shaving my head with battery powered clipper. It works as expected without concerns about cracking glass in the shower. I wish they made a much larger size mirror- it is light enough that i suspect they could. Good for travelling as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror for my hubby&#x27;s birthday.  At first I was kinda skeptical, but after reading other reviews &amp;how the company is dedicated to their customer&#x27;s satisfaction I decided to purchase this one.  He loves the mirror &amp; it truly is fog free; does just what it says &amp; they have great customer service!</li>
    <li> Nice little mirror, it works great. Not all foggy and junk anymore, it&#x27;s awesome being able to really see what&#x27;s going on while shaving and stuffs.&lt;br /&gt;Cool.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror. Got a second one for our guest shower, too. Simple concept, inexpensive, and won&#x27;t wear out. I can shave in the shower without having the mirror fog up or it falling off the shower wall. Nice!</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research to find a reasonable priced mirror that actually works. It pretty much does as advertised. No mirror is going to be 100% fog free. I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this mirror for just over a year now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, their support is great. I mean, it is a mirror, but when I contacted them to see if they could send another hook, as I mounted it too high, they sent a hook and a suction cup. I wound up losing the hook, after using the suction cup for a long time. I find there is much utility in being able to move the mirror around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just recently, the backing has started to come off the mirror. At first, the mirror surface was not affected. Now, there is about a 1/8 inch gap at the bottom where there is no reflective area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hook that it comes with is very permanent. I had a hard time getting it off, and decided to just leave it for the next tenets to deal with. The fog free claim has been hashed over a few times, but works pretty well. Rinse and shave. If the mirror is touching a cold surface, you are going to have to do this several times. I normally need to rinse the mirror once or twice per shave. The only way to get a fog free mirror is going to be by heating the mirror.</li>
    <li> Place the hook right for your face in the shower.  Run the front and back sides  of the mirror under hot water for 15 seconds. Then Run your hand down the mirror to wipe off the water and shave your  handsome face till you drop.  Fantastic piece of shower equipment. Great seller!  Great price......</li>
    <li> Often, the best-designed things just work, as they say. They don&#x27;t shout &amp;#34;Look at me!&amp;#34; or get dragged down with &amp;#34;features&amp;#34; or embellishments that no one really asked for. This is a well-designed and well-made product. One nice detail, which is the kind of of thing that&#x27;d be missing if it were made by people who don&#x27;t care: it has a small spot of weakly adhesive putty inside the hook, to keep the mirror still. I wouldn&#x27;t have thought to write a review of a shaving mirror, but I happened to see Amazon&#x27;s profile of the family business and how they manufacture it -- with a non-profit that provides jobs for people with disabilities. Win win win.</li>
    <li> This product is a joke or a scam.  They are just selling regular mirror as fog free mirror.  Look at the attached pic.  They are just fooling us.  I understand the &amp;#34;science&amp;#34; and I have had owned real fog free mirrors in the past.  You don&#x27;t need to heat anything before using them.  Returning this mirror asap.  Btw, if you really want to apply this &amp;#34;science&amp;#34; then you can buy a mirror from dollar store and use it, don&#x27;t spend $10.</li>
    <li> Bought this mirror for my husband for Christmas. Very disappointed. Entirely too small to use full time and it will not stay on the wall.</li>
    <li> It is well made mirror that contains nothing extra ordinary. Just like any other mirror, this needs heat to keep the condensation away. Three star for good material. Negative 2 star for deceptive marketing.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror for shaving in the shower after reading the other reviews.  I understood I would need to place the mirror low enough there wasn&#x27;t a temperature difference and that I would need to run it under the water briefly to ensure similar temperature so it would stay clear.  And it really does work well when I do this.  However, less than a month after having it, I noticed the mirror (paint?) was chipping from all the edges.  I can still use the majority of the mirror but it looks really bad and I wonder about safety having a toddler in my home.  So, while it does work well, I&#x27;m not confident in longevity for the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband suggests using soap on a regular mirror to keep it fogfree but I was more concerned about safety with a real mirror.</li>
    <li> I have owned at least 15 different kinds of shaving mirrors because I get a much closer shave in the shower vs standing at the sink. The reasons for so many were the first suction cups would not stay. The thought I needed a place to hang my razor and then a place to put the shaving cream. Well then had to have a radio. In all of these I had to either throw water to clear the mirror or use the anti-fog that did not last. Now this little mirror hangs on a hook and you just hold it under the shower and it&#x27;s ready to go. I first thought the small size  would be  a problem but I can see fine and it takes up a lot less space. So for a good shave image in the shower this is the one for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this mirror for over 4 months now and it works exactly as advertised, you warm it in the shower water and it stays fog free for plenty enough time to lather up, shave and rinse with a crystal clear mirror.  This appears to be the simplest (and best) solution to the fog free mirror.  I was turned off by the designs requiring a water reservoir to be filled as I feel it will get scummy with time and be one more item that needs to be cleaned.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is the way water will bubble on the mirror surface (think freshly waxed car).  I think I may try a coating of rain-x on it to see if the water will sheet off it to give it a fully clear mirror surface (the company should treat the mirrors off the hop with such a coating).  That&#x27;s really my only complaint, and it&#x27;s small as this little mirror is by far superior to every other \\&quot;fog free\\&quot; mirror I&#x27;ve tried and hated.</li>
    <li> Awesome mirror! Works perfect! Fogs up..Run the mirror under the water a few seconds.. And No fog! Great product !</li>
    <li> I put this up next to my old mirror that this one was supposedly replacing. While it might of stayed fog free (it was honestly hard to tell this point), I could not see anything due the entire mirror being covered by tiny droplets of water clinging to the surface of the mirror...brand new out of the box. You can kind of use it to shave, but too many details of your face will be obscured by the tiny droplets of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My \\&quot;old\\&quot; mirror occasionally fogs up, but after splashing with water the mirror is crystal clear in it&#x27;s reflection, showing every contour of my face.  I recommend sticking with a traditional mirror like that than this one.</li>
    <li> The rules on Amazon state: Full disclosure: If you received a free product in exchange for your review, please clearly and conspicuously disclose that that you received the product free of charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the following free of charge in exchange for a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First: The Shave Well fogless mirror is not made of heavy traditional glass like other mirrors, so this is a bonus if you have  children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror is not truly fogless: Had to stop shaving, re-warm the mirror and hang it back up to finish shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does fall off: Also the mirror comes with a plastic hook and a sticky adhesive backing that allows the mirror to be placed on/taken off as needed. Eventually the stickiness wears off, and the mirror no-longer holds to the wall despite the companies claims that it won&#x27;t fall off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Size: We found the mirror too small for our liking. Perhaps the Deluxe Shave Well mirror would have been the better option.</li>
    <li> Not much to say here other than this mirror works exactly as described. I love it! Simply follow the directions and happy shaving follows.</li>
    <li> Follow the instructions on this mirror and you&#x27;ll absolutely be satisfied, I know I am. At the beginning of your shower hold it up to the hot water for about ten seconds (or so) so that the temperature of the material matches that of the water. This will prevent most, if not all fog buildup during the shower. Worst case scenario you easily remove it from the wall hook, rinse it for a second, and put it back. Although the mirror is small, you&#x27;re not paying a lot for such a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror and works just as directed. Second purchase after my first one cracked during a move. Would have continued to use it except in my culture it is considered bad luck to use a broken mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The material is light enough to stay put on the hook and is easy to defog by putting under the water and remains defogged for a few minutes, enough for em to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended, and thanks for making a cool product!</li>
    <li> I hemmed and hawed for a while before placing the order, but I decided to go with the smaller unit and see how it works. I&#x27;ve been using it a weeks now, and here is my take on it:&lt;br /&gt;1) The size is fine. I was a little shocked when I saw how small it really was, but it&#x27;s not an issue when you&#x27;re actually shaving. After using it for the first time, I had no desire to order the larger one.&lt;br /&gt;2) Fog-less: Yes it is. How much it is affected by fog is primarily a function of the ambient air temperature in the bathroom. During our hot Texas summer, I didn&#x27;t even have to wet the mirror as the ambient air was somewhere around 78. Now that it&#x27;s gotten cooler, the mirror does fog up if I don&#x27;t wet it first. Running the back under the shower for a few seconds is usually all it takes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the only issue I have is that the mirror is so light that exhaling makes it swing a little bit on the hook. Maybe I need to learn how not to breathe like a mule though. ;)</li>
    <li> If you follow the easy directions, it works with no issues. Much better and cleaner than using the sink. This mirror was simple to install and I would recommend to any guy.</li>
    <li> It does fog some BUT very durable design, I&#x27;d actually buy it again because of past durability issues.</li>
    <li> I ordered this thinking it is the regular size mirror but I was wrong. It is smaller but it still does the job.</li>
    <li> This is, bar none, the best fog-free shaving mirror in the world. Having used dozens of them in the past, this is the only one that continues to work as intended. I have a larger one for home and the smaller one for traveling. If you&#x27;re a guy and don&#x27;t shave in the shower, you are missing the best shave of your life (with all the steam, water, etc...). But you need something light enough to hold in one hand (this mirror) while holding the shaver in the other. You can also use the enclosed hook if you don&#x27;t want to hold it. Just remember to run water over it before using. This gets rid of any ambient temperature differences between the mirror and the air around it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you first get it, there&#x27;s a protective coating on the mirror side that is very hard to get off without using a knife (I don&#x27;t have long fingernails). It would be great if it had a peel handle to remove the protective film as it took me five minutes to figure it out. In lieu of that, they could also put the letter B on the backside as both the front and the back look alike until you remove the film. I kept trying to remove the film from backside until I realized it was on the other side. Even then it took another five minutes to lift off the very thin protective film. I finally got out a steak knife to slip between the film and the plastic mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is the best shaving mirror you could possibly get, either small or large. Aside from that minor nitpicking, you won&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nothing more than a mirror. I have to keep it under water 3-4 times during my shower to get rid of the fog. Why do they call it Fog Free??</li>
    <li> It works, and does not fog up, but the size is a little too small for me. If it was about 30% larger, it would be perfect.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a mirror...but definitely not fog free.</li>
    <li> Great little mirror. I say little because I was expecting something bigger. It works at the size it is though. Attached to wall easily and stronger. For the price 55</li>
    <li> I used to shave just after I got out of the shower, but had to deal with the foggy mirror and cleaning up the sink. Now I just shave in the shower with this handy mirror and don&#x27;t have to deal with the cleanup or the foggy mirror.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very, very happy I bought this mirror. The hook has been  totally reliable so far and the mirror works as advertised. My only concern was that it seemed a little small and the picture on the packaging makes it seem as if you can only see a little of your face. Happily, I discovered that you can easily see your entire face in this mirror. It doesn&#x27;t have magnification, which may be desired by some, but I haven&#x27;t found a need for it. I also love that you can remove it from the hook and hold it however if you need to see a different angle or whatever. Totally satisfied so far with this product. Great value, too.</li>
    <li> it is just as it is described. hold it under the water for a fraction of a second and your good to go. perfect size and the hook is surprisingly durable i have the water flowing down the wall the hook is on and seriously thought after a week it would fall but its been two weeks and that hook doesn&#x27;t budge. the mirror surface is clearer than my actual bathroom mirror as well</li>
    <li> It works just like advertised. I have it permanently mounted in my shower with the included hook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Amazon &amp;#34;recommends&amp;#34; purchasing the mirror with a two-pack of adhesive hooks. I did so, but found that unsurprisingly the mirror comes with its own adhesive hook, so you don&#x27;t need to spend the extra $3 on adhesive hooks, unless you want to have multiple hanging points for the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mirror is made out of sturdy plastic and so far is pretty indestructable.</li>
    <li> You have to wet it to keep it from fogging.  Sometimes you have to repeat this process.  Water droplets keep you from seeing clearly.  It also is on the small side.  Suggest; a back to back mirror with magnification and normal views on each side.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend has a back injury and wanted to shave in the shower.  We affixed it so it would be on level with his face. He absolutely loved it.  The mirror is the perfect size, if all you want to see if your face.  The mount never came off.  We moved and left it at the old place, so we&#x27;ll likely be ordering another soon.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror back in August 2013.  I&#x27;ve bought quite a few &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirrors over the years but most of them I guess use some sort of chemical that keeps it fogless and that wears off after a month or two and then you&#x27;re just left with a shower mirror.  Its been about 5 months since I got the Shave Well mirror and it still works just as good as the first day I got it.  I keep waiting for the day that I try to get rid of the fog and it doesn&#x27;t work but that day has never come.  This is by far the best shaving mirror I&#x27;ve had, it is truly fogless if you follow the instructions.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok. nothing hi tech. a piece of safety mirror (acrylic) with a hole and a hook. run it under the shower water to bring it to the temp of the water and voila, no fog...just lots of drops of water and a tiny mirror.</li>
    <li> The mirror is small and easy to remove and clean. It is all far from \\&quot;fog free.\\&quot; Just like any mirror you will end up rinsing in hot water and wiping it off to keep it from fogging. Your breath will easily make it fog. I find rubbing it with a bit of shaving cream and rinsing it off works best, but any mirror will do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Check the comments on this review for a detailed response for possible solutions to this issue. The company at least stands behind their product.</li>
    <li> worthless. If there was a mirror in it, I couldn&#x27;t find it. Looked like some cardboard backed reflective aluminum. I threw it away</li>
    <li> Bought for hubby who is disabled VET and he loves it- he can shave in shower and not have fogged mirror- and gets it all done at one time. He wants to order another one for our other bathroom.</li>
    <li> This has made shaving the shower much easier.  It&#x27;s light weight, easy to defog, and stay defog long enough to get the job done.</li>
    <li> This product is genius in it&#x27;s simplicity.  If used as instructed, it stays perfectly clear as I shave in the shower.  Rather than rely on the coating, it allows you to run it under the hot water and equalize the temperature to avoid fogging and then hang it back on the hook.  Get the big one.</li>
    <li> The Mirror is Ok but it is totally NOT Fog free!</li>
    <li> Removing the screen protector is not easy and ended up scratching the mirror in the process of trying to get it off. Not worth the frustration, will buy another product next time.</li>
    <li> Brought this couple of Christmas ago for my husband.  He liked it.  I was looking for inexpensive items to fill a stocking.  Box was roughed up, but product intact.  Contacted company about box said Amazon packages but offered to send me new box for gifting.  Told them no need.</li>
    <li> PIECE OF S&amp;*$.  Don&#x27;t waste your $.  Can&#x27;t believe the great reviews.  Lasted like a day and probably costs ten cents to make.</li>
    <li> The item does fog up. The instructions say to prevent fogging, you remove the mirror from the shower hook and heat it up in the water. It will be without fog for about five minutes, at which time you have to take it off the hook again and heat it under the water.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call this mirror fog free... as you need to run it under water eveey few minutes to clear the fog. Also the sticky hook feel off the wall a couple times (and yes i cleaned the wall before applying). Its a small mirror and not the best quality , it would probably be useless if i was a man using it to shave</li>
    <li> Perfect quality. I liked it. I always wanted this mirror but I couldn&#x27;t find it at this good price &amp; high quality. Delivery time was perfect. thank you</li>
    <li> This mirror is truly fog-free if you keep it clean. And it doesn&#x27;t break when dropped. Use the command hook to hang it anywhere.  Doesn&#x27;t get easier than this.</li>
    <li> Just as the desciption says..wet the mirror under water, then shave away. My shaves are so much better and closer now.</li>
    <li> This mirror is exactly what I wanted. It was a but smaller than I expected - but that&#x27;s only because I estimated it wrong.</li>
    <li> I spent a lot of money buying mirrors for the shower, this, so far has been the best of all while being the cheapest, I recommend this product to anyone who needs it. Good and cheap. I ordered one for the other bathroom, means it is good.</li>
    <li> Men really need the Shave Well, for a close shave. There isn&#x27;t anywhere better to shave than in the shower!! Not to mention the sink isn&#x27;t full of hair!! SWEEEET!!!&lt;br /&gt;This would be a perfect stocking stuffer!!</li>
    <li> I like this mirror. Very useful. I just wish it was a bit bigger. But, it does its job. It makes it easier to shave in the shower, which is awesome. It doesn&#x27;t fog if you use it correctly, too. Nice product.</li>
    <li> love that this is just a mirror. I&#x27;ve bought my husband others in the past that have addition bells and whistles. Those always break or fall off the tile wall constantly because of the weight. This one Is just perfect.</li>
    <li> I love my new truly fog free shower mirror.  It was easy to install, is lightweight, and is truly fog free as long as you take care of it the correct way.</li>
    <li> Not a great mirror.  It tends to get spotty after about a month or two of use.  I haven&#x27;t found one that doesn&#x27;t though.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband.  He loves it.  Says it rates a 939 out of 1,000.  Says it is \\&quot;Gustavian\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I have been using this every other day to shave in the shower and it works great. If you hold the mirror under the water for 10 seconds on each side you will have a clear mirror for your entire shave. I recommend this to ANYONE that wants to shave in the shower. I find shaving in the shower better for my beard as the hot air helps for a smoother more comfortable shave. Also cleanup is easier. The mirror comes with a stick on hook for it however I do not use it. This is a great little mirror!</li>
    <li> It is not a fog free shower mirror. Not sure if there even is such a thing, but this one claims to be one. Couldn&#x27;t give it a positive review  because of that. If you shave really quick you can probably finish before it fogs up.</li>
    <li> The adhesive and hook are great and secure well to the shower wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror itself is quite small... I guess a good size if you plan on keeping it off the hook and in your hand to shave, but be aware of the size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most disappointing part was the fog-free capacity. The mirror does not retain heat well enough to stay fog-free for more than approximately two-three minutes. You&#x27;ll find yourself taking it off the hook to hold under water two to three times if you&#x27;re using it for shaving (or maybe you&#x27;ll just commit to shaving really fast). Running it under the water so much also means you&#x27;re going to have watermarks obscuring the view on your already-small mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a terrible purchase but I&#x27;d say &amp;#34;TRULY FOG FREE&amp;#34; is misleading.</li>
    <li> I used to use one of those bulky mirrors (with the suction cups to secure it to the wall and a small rack to hold shaving equipment). It supposedly had a fog free finish which promptly fogged up almost immediately after use. After six years, it grew a bit moldy so I bought this mirror instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened the box I wasn&#x27;t terribly impressed. It is plastic and sort of felt like something they might give you to shave with in prison. But I decided to give it a try anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had long been familiar with the science behind a heated mirror not fogging. I used to run water over my old mirror and it worked for a few minutes before fogging back up. The thin design of this mirror allowed for sustained fog free use. It&#x27;s size is also perfect for holding while shaving. It&#x27;s light weight so holding it is easy and if you drop it it doesn&#x27;t sound like you dropped a pillowcase full of doorknobs into the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, because it has no real nooks and crannies, it doesn&#x27;t develop mold as my old mirror did around creases and in between little crevices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple. Clean. Effective. And best of all, inexpensive.</li>
    <li> It is great to have in the shower. It never falls and it only requires you to run it under the water to get a clear view. Would recommend</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror for my husband, he loves it more than all the other (more expensive) shower mirrors I have gotten him in the past. He said he has never had one work so well. If you looking for a great mirror to use in the shower buy this one. Good price and does what it claims.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought two of these mirrors, only because one got lost while I was moving. Great product. I love that it is removable from the wall, making it easy to run under hot water and giving the mirror a clear look. Always works.</li>
    <li> I have followed the instructions but can&#x27;t get the mirror to stay fog free. Wetting it does make the mirror resist fogging up for a while, but it is really annoying having to wet it constantly. Other than that, I like the mirror.</li>
    <li> This fogs up like crazy.  My husband was  not impressed at all.</li>
    <li> Fog free? not in my shower.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions that say basically to wet it front and back when you first shower and still fogs up pretty bad when water is really hot. Not very expensive so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, doesn&#x27;t have a holder for razer. Not bad for the price overall.</li>
    <li> Nice quality mirror, well thought out packaging that includes everything needed for mounting.  As long as you briefly warm it up in the water stream, it is completely fog free.  Finally able to see what I&#x27;m shaving in the shower.</li>
    <li> Well its certainly not fog free.  It fogs up all the time.  I basically have to keep it under the shower water while I shave.  The only good thing is that it dont stain like the other shower shave mirrors.  Or at least so far.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a low-cost product that does an OK job at first, but I left mine in the shower and the silver backing started coming away about six to eight months after purchase. I kept using it because at first it was just a nuisance, but eventually enough of the backing was gone that it became impossible to see anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would probably be a fine product if you planned to dry it off and remove from the shower every time, but I doubt most people do that. Probably better to find one with a more durable finish.</li>
    <li> Fogless yes. But once the water spots get on there this mirror is useless. Need to try a different one.</li>
    <li> Great product. Really works. The trick to get the water spots to run off easier is rub toothepaste all over it before you take a shower. It will stay completely clear with no fog or water droplets.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think a fogless mirror was even possible. But this has been a great product, and my wife never yells at me for making a mess anymore.</li>
    <li> This products works as advertised.  Nice size -- big enough to see, but not so big that you accidentally bump it all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe would be that the mirror isn&#x27;t very clear in use because of the residual water on it.  The best I&#x27;ve gotten so far is to wet it, then hold it edge-wise and whack it on my hand a few times.  That knocks off most of the water, but it&#x27;s not perfect.  I could try Rain-X or something (that&#x27;s next).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t use the supplied plastic hook; I just hang it on a razor hook thing I already had for the shower.</li>
    <li> Fog free? Maybe for about 20 seconds...I just rub a bit of soap on the mirror and it stays clear enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d certainly recommend this mirror, not for it&#x27;s &amp;#34;fog-free&amp;#34; idealistic fantasy, but for the fact that it&#x27;s a decent size for shaving in the shower or signaling for help while stranded on an island with your loved ones.</li>
    <li> My only issue is now I realize how poorly lit my bathroom is. The mirror works great, but it&#x27;s hard to see my reflection due to lack of light (no fault of the mirror). And yes, it is fogless after you put it under the shower head for a little bit.</li>
    <li> Suppose I didn&#x27;t read the details well enough. It&#x27;s much smaller than I had thought. It gets the job done and doesn&#x27;t fog up. I guess I&#x27;m just not wowed by it. It&#x27;s really nothing special. Just a small mirrored piece of plastic that sticks to the wall with a command hook.</li>
    <li> At the price, the mirror is a bargain. It&#x27;s not overly large, but does fit well in your hand and is big enough to see your whole face (unless you have either a giant face or are holding it inches away from where you&#x27;re shaving). The &amp;#34;fog free&amp;#34; feature comes from heating up the mirror and I&#x27;ve found you need to heat it up every 2-3 minutes or so to keep it really fog free. I wish I could run it under water and get a full shave in without having to reheat the mirror (hence the 4 stars instead of 5), but other than that minor gripe it works well.</li>
    <li> Love it. I use it ever day</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this mirror for a a few months now, and it has not fogged up yet. Stays pretty clean!!!</li>
    <li> I still use it every night to make sure I remove all my makeup in the shower. I&#x27;ve dropped it countless times over the couple years I&#x27;ve had it and there&#x27;s only a small scratch on the back. Loooove it.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my current fogged up fog free mirror and love it. It does still fog up a little when I breathe while shaving which could become a problem but I&#x27;ve adjusted by taking more frequent breaks to rinse my razor and it&#x27;s not a problem. In my experience, all fog free mirrors start out great and end up to where you can barely see in them but we&#x27;ll see. I&#x27;m hoping I found one that&#x27;ll last a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price I don&#x27;t think you could go wrong with this mirror. I did however replace the two sided tape provided with a 3M removable tape.</li>
    <li> Like all of these types of mirrors, I have to put water on it to keep it from steaming up. The manufacture states that it has to be positioned in a particular spot and used a particular way. Well that&#x27;s not always applicable based on your shower/situation. I have a bathtub/shower and there&#x27;s a window in it. I have only one spot to put the mirror, and the mirror fogs up whether the window is open or not. It works best when the window is cracked about 2&amp;#34; and the steam can be pulled away from the mirror. Honestly, I don&#x27;t ever expect that anyone will make one of these that works perfectly, but once I put water on this, it works longer than all the others I&#x27;ve had, and it gets me though my shave. Also, the water runs right off it when I first wet it and doesn&#x27;t leave little droplets all over it, like all the other mirrors did. I also dry mine every time I get out of the shower to keep water spots from forming on it. I also like the little hanging tab for it, which has stayed stuck to my shower wall with no issues. And I like the hole in the mirror for hanging it, as it makes it easily removable so I can dry it.</li>
    <li> My facial hair grows pretty thick, and I&#x27;m not a daily shaver. So when I do shave, it becomes a bit of an ordeal. Because of all this, I&#x27;ve always preferred to shave in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror is an excellent product for my purposes. It is very light, and very easy to install. It just needs to be run under the water for a few moments to reach an ideal temperature and prevent it from fogging up. I usually let it sit on the floor of the shower to have the water run over it while I handle my pre-shave business in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If shaving takes long [like it does for me] you may have to run it under water more than once because it&#x27;ll start to fog eventually, but this is a non-issue to me, and it still makes this product superior to more expensive shaving mirrors.</li>
    <li> It works pretty well.  Would be nice if it was bigger.  It has not fallen down in 3 months.  I had a suction cup one that would fall down all the time.</li>
    <li> bought this thinking i&#x27;d use it for a shower mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s so small i decided it&#x27;s better to use as a travel mirror as i shave my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is good that it does not fog up so far.</li>
    <li> We would recommend this mirror.  We have been using it for a few months.  It works great, just let the hot water run over it for 15-20 seconds before shaving.  It is a little on the small side, so you just see sections at a time.</li>
    <li> We like the fact that it is simple (nothing will rust), hangs on a hook (we bought an InterDesign PowerLock Suction Hook) to easily remove and clean and or rinse under the shower head. Our experience with fog free mirrors is they only work decently for a while. So I&#x27;m a little nervous it won&#x27;t start being permanently hazy, but I have hope with this one. The packaging indicates running the whole mirror under warm water to get it acclimated to the steamy environment is the trick.</li>
    <li> Great product. Wish I&#x27;d ordered it years ago.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome little mirror.  We&#x27;ve been using it a few months now and it still works as it should.  It was originally bought for my boyfriend to be able to shave in the shower, but I even use it when washing my face.  Would definitely recommend to anyone who wants an affordable mirror for their shower.</li>
    <li> Very simple to use. Just hold under warm water for 5 seconds on each side, shake off the excess water, and you are good to go. This is a good value considering there is a mirror selling here at Amazon for triple the price.  THIS is the one to buy.</li>
    <li> The quality of the mirror is really clear and doesn&#x27;t fog and has yet to get coated with hard water like other shower mirrors. The hook didn&#x27;t stick to the shower wall</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had many different mirrors over the years and this is the only one that really works.  Its also light and easy to handle; don&#x27;t need to worry about it falling because of bad suction cups because of the adhesive mount and it being so light.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it was going to be so small. You have to put it under hot water for a few sec and it doesn&#x27;t fog. pretty smart.</li>
    <li> If you follow the instructions... this does what it says it will do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that you can unhook it from the holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I read a review about the company getting back to the customer about a complained, their response &amp; customer attention pushed me to buy this product. A company with not only a great product, but great customer service, is one to buy from.</li>
    <li> It is fine but since there is a bigger one I would get that one</li>
    <li> Absolutely worthless, followed the instructions, NEVER worked properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve developed some new instructions in order to utilize this product&#x27;s full potential below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply just open the box and place mirror directly into trash...</li>
    <li> Make sure you rinse the mirror before using it so it wont fog up,  the mirror does a great job in the shower and my wife always seems to steal it for putting on makeup at the sink.  She thinks &amp;#34;It&#x27;s the perfect size for eyebrows&amp;#34;  My only issue is always having to double check to make sure the mirror is where I left it...</li>
    <li> Perfect size for hanging in our shower, and with the hole in the top it can be hung easily! Just the right size.</li>
    <li> Mirror fogged up in first 3 seconds. Very small also ..</li>
    <li> Mirror works very well and does not fog up. It was much smaller than I expected, being used to European shaving mirrors, but works well. It is big enough to frame the whole face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very light and seems unbreakable. Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> This cost me $15 with shipping and it is only a 6&amp;#34; piece of plastic with a hole cut out for a hook. Dont get ripped-off like I did.  Update: Although the product was a BIG disappointment for the price, The Shave Well Company turns out to be a stand-up company and refunded my money.</li>
    <li> I use this to shave my head in the shower.  Until receiving this, I&#x27;d been shaving my head blindly and without a mirror.  It&#x27;s not truly fogless, because it does fog up, but putting it under the water for a few seconds to bring it to the temperature of the shower un-fogs it and keeps it that way long enough for me to take care of my head.  It&#x27;s also nice that it comes with a hangar to stick on the shower wall to hang from.</li>
    <li> Does the job, good price, good quality and ship quick</li>
    <li> I shave my head and face and I needed something for the shower. Works well but mount did not. I keep it in the shower and it does work great. I have hard water so I use toothpaste once in a while on it and it&#x27;s like new. Just make sure you let the water run over it so the temperature adjusts and the fog disappears. I took off 1 star for the mount.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Initially, I had a problem with the adhesive hook. I contacted customer service, and they sent a new adhesive hook...no questions asked. I love a company that stands behind their products.</li>
    <li> My son loves this mirror.  It does exactly what it is supposed to do if you follow the directions.  Super transaction!!</li>
    <li> The name does not lie, it is truly fog free!  My husband uses this mirror everyday to shave in the shower.  He did not hang it on the wall, but holds it in one hand and shaves in the other.  This feature is also great, because when we travel, he can bring it with him.  It is very light and small and so it doesn&#x27;t take up much space.  This mirror has fallen several times and has never broken or shown any signs of damage.  After trying several &amp;#34;fog free&amp;#34; mirrors, this is by far the best we have bought.</li>
    <li> Got used to is so much that every morning I use it and I&#x27;m loving it. Got used to shaving in the shower and I cant shave without seeing myself on a mirror. Am loving it and I can&#x27;t live without it anymore.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little smaller than I thought it would be, but my husband has not complained. It is truly fog-free!</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this mirror. I have found it very useful. Indeed it truly is fog-free. V. happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I have had several &amp;#34;Fog free&amp;#34; shaving mirrors - they all promise results and then fog up as soon as I started to shave.  This mirror was very different.  I followed the instructions for the mirror and it works perfectly.  I can shave my whole face without a bit of fog on the mirror.  I installed the hook on the cultured marble and leave the mirror on the hook when I shave.  I only pull it off to run it under the water for a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a product that does what it promises, this is it.</li>
    <li> Buy this item if you want to get out quick in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;I shower and shave at the same time.  I need to look at my face so I don&#x27;t cut it up and get those sideburns right.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap and lasts forever.  Don&#x27;t forget to run hot water on it for about 30 seconds so it&#x27;ll keep clear throughout the shave.</li>
    <li> Its a mirror with a hole in it.Comes with a little sticky hook.Seriously for what you get the price should be 3.00 not 10.00</li>
    <li> NOT truely fog free.  Tried this and it fogged up on first use.  Its made of plastic which means it can still be cold enough for water to condense on it, ie. create fog.  Its not bad, but I still find myself having to throw water at it to be able to see myself.  There is no special coating either to prevent the fog.  Its just a plastic mirror.</li>
    <li> Makes shaving in the shower a lot easier. No more shaving by braille. One piece of advice, dry it with your towel when you&#x27;re done. Avoids mineral build up.</li>
    <li> It really is a fog free mirror, you just have to run it under warm water. Also, if you let cold air in, it will fog up the mirror. The bathroom has to be warm (water/air).</li>
    <li> Despite following the instructions, I could not get the fog to dissipate. Also, this is very lightweight and the hole is not buffed or coated or anything. Why does that matter? Because to follow the instructions, you have to take the mirror off the hook every time you want to shave so you can hold it under the shower head. Sooner or later, that rough edge will cause you to drop it, and then you have little shards of glass all up in your feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, you can get better results with the cheapo travel mirror from your favorite big box drugstore. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m back to using.</li>
    <li> Dropped it once in the shower and grasped... Not a scratch.. LOVE IT. Use every shower</li>
    <li> Barely works, way way too small, moves constantly while you are shaving producing a rocking boat effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get something else - waste of time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder so it&#x27;s crucial that I have a mirror in all areas of my household to admire this gift that god has given to the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I don&#x27;t do it, who will?</li>
    <li> my husband loves it...even travels with it (since it&#x27;s not permanently attached to wall). great item</li>
    <li> Nice, cheap Mirror. Gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Works great and good size for the shower. No problems. When it fogs up you just put water on it and it clears up.</li>
    <li> Terrible. Don&#x27;t waste your money. This mirror fogs up like any mirror. You are better off buying one from the dollar store.</li>
    <li> The mirror is made of a plastic material and just isn&#x27;t very good.&lt;br /&gt;It holds water on it&#x27;s surface more than glass so it&#x27;s always blurry.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe a dose of Rain-X will make it work better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered two of these mirrors--one in April of 2012 and one in Sept. of 2013. The size of the mirror is functional and the adhesive hook holds up well. On both of the mirrors, the thermal backing material started flaking off within a few weeks and after several months so much of the backing had peeled that it&#x27;s nearly impossible to see anything in the mirrors. They don&#x27;t see heavy use--only two people use this shower (neither mirror was ever dropped, and the mirrors themselves aren&#x27;t used/held under the water every day). I&#x27;m not sure if the mirrors I purchased were defective, or if 6-12 months is the normal lifespan for this product. Before the flaking starts, the product is great--just be aware that it might need to be replaced occasionally.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this product because my previous mirror finally gave out.  I followed the instructions and the mirror still fogs unless you run it in the warm water again.  :(</li>
    <li> I bought this item for someone who enjoys shaving in the shower.  The last shower mirror began falling off the wall within a week of purchase.  The clip system on the Shave Well mirror is holding fast, with no slippage.  In addition, the mirror, although small, is perfectly sized and does not fog up at all.  He is very happy and smoothly shaved!</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I needed. Stays up don&#x27;t fog easily I throw on some conditioner to prevent fog anyway. Get it</li>
    <li> Definitely works as described.  Small, but still a good size for your shower.  You just need to heat it up first for it to be &amp;#34;fog free.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have to constantly run it under water, but you know what.. it&#x27;s a mirror, in my shower.. it fogs up every 2 minutes.. it works ok.</li>
    <li> All you need to is submerge it under water and you have a perfectly portable, perfectly fog proof shower mirror. I&#x27;m so glad I got this, because shaving in the shower is much, much easier! Plus, I can make awesome shampoo mohawks now.</li>
    <li> Works for me.  They follow up very well to be sure you are happy.  I think this might be a bit small for shaving, but I use it for getting the part in my hair which is short and can dry before I get to the sink.</li>
    <li> I have the worst luck with shower mirrors. They break, they fog up, and they always get scratched and unusable eventually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this one, though. It is not actually &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34;, but de-fogging it is very easy. It hangs on a small hook, and is easily removed to run under the water. De-fogging the mirror is simply a matter of equalizing the temperature of the mirror to the air around it, and running this under the water stream for a few seconds accomplishes this fairly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, they recommend cleaning with toothpaste and your fingers so that it doesn&#x27;t scratch. This works well, too, and only takes a very tiny amount of toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it were a little bigger, but it is light, compact, and such a refreshingly simple design after all the over-designed, lighted behemoths I&#x27;m used to breaking. Get one, if you need a mirror in the shower for shaving, etc. I think you&#x27;ll be fairly happy with it.</li>
    <li> This mirror is very small. I would say it it about 5x7. It would have been nice if the size was listed in the description. All it said was this mirror is 30% larger than the original. I would hate to know how small the original was. I guess for 10 bucks and free shipping it will do just fine. I just wish it were bigger.</li>
    <li> This is a mirror to hang in your shower and it doesn&#x27;t get any more complex than that. I do think it&#x27;s a little misleading to promote it as &#x27;truly fog free&#x27; when you have to run it under the water to take away the fog. That&#x27;s exactly what you have to do to any mirror to make it fog free. I think if they&#x27;re going to promote it as such, then it should require that it have some sort of technology that makes it actually fog free without the need to run it under the water.</li>
    <li> This product&#x27;s simplicity is what I like about it.  If the adhesive hook ever fails or if I want to relocate the mirror, it can be easily replaced with a similar hook from your local hardware store. It works exactly as the manufacturer describes.  If I ever need to order another mirror, I will look for this brand but I may choose the slightly larger model. I have no regrets with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Simple and cheap.  The hook did fall from the shower wall but I think I did  not prep the tiles for adhesion as well as I could have..  It has fallen a few times and has not cracked or shattered.  Great product.  I recommend.</li>
    <li> I had bought a expense shower mirror and the thing finally was tossed out this past week. It fogged up, didn&#x27;t hold up well in the shower, and was a big waste of money. I was a little cautious when I saw this mirror however decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I did, it&#x27;s awesome! The hook/hanging feature works great and allows you to easily remove the mirror to either clean it or warm it up so it doesn&#x27;t fog. At first this was a bit of a turn off, apparently I&#x27;m just lazy, but it works great. The sticky pad that holds the unit in place is also extremely strong and feels solid, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about constantly knocking off a suction cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that really surprised me was the amount of customer service I got when I bought the mirror. I figured it was a $10 dollar mirror, no big deal. I was wrong. After getting my mirror I was sent a follow up email giving me more instructions on how to use it and some best practices to keep it working. It was a little gesture but it impressed me the company would take the time to follow up on a generally cheap item. I applaud them for their efforts and nice to know a company stands behind its products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall great mirror, great size, and great price!</li>
    <li> sides flaking after 6 mos use</li>
    <li> My mirror stays fog-free for a bit.  I have to put it under the shower stream 3-4 times while shaving.  Maybe it is too high in the shower but it is at face level, so it can&#x27;t really be moved.</li>
    <li> TRULY fogs up faster than any other surface in my bathroom.  The adhesive on the hook has less grip than peanut butter on a hot dashboard -- completely inadequate for hanging on any surface approaching vertical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a picture of fog that lays on the floor, this might work for you.</li>
    <li> It works. No special coating or anything. The fog-free works because you heat it up under the running shower water</li>
    <li> Works just as advertised.  Run it under hot water for a few minutes, as the fabricant says, and it is a charm</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t last very long before all finish came off mirrored part. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> This mirror is awesome, it doesn&#x27;t fog up as long as you run it under the water for 15 seconds or so.  Highly advise this mirror if you want to be able to shave in the shower.</li>
    <li> Works well after you heat it up with water.</li>
    <li> Hanger came off the shower wall. Only downside I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
    <li> reflective coating peeled off after a month or so.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Always pretty foggy and hook fell off, now I just have a foggy mirror that I can&#x27;t connect to anything.</li>
    <li> Nice mirror for the shower!  I felt it was maybe too small in the beginning, but after using this for over a year, it&#x27;s been perfect.  So far, the hook has stayed firmly attached to my shower.  No complaints.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I had used 3M fog free mirrors for years.  They would work for a week and then fog up and I would have to rub a little soap on them each time I took a shower.  I decided to look for alternatives but I didn&#x27;t want one with suction cups (the 3M strips held forever).  This mirror seems to do the job.  I was a bit concerned the edges might be sharp but they are fine.      A small note:  I like hot showers and my mirror needs a little more than 2-3 seconds in the water stream to last through a shave.</li>
    <li> My first impression was that it seemed small.   I recently started shaving my head due to being follically challenged with age and I wanted to shave in the shower as that provides the best results. So this is my first shower mirror in years. It&#x27;s light weight, I believe it&#x27;s acrylic with a rubberry backside for a good grip even when wet. It appears to be good quaity &amp; I saw no distortions. I also like the hook, which allows for easy placement where you want and with more hooks (you can buy at any hardware store) you can hang easily in diferent locals for different sized users.  Now to the functionality - I started the shower and upon entering heated the mirror up to check it&#x27;s fog free claim. I then soaked in the hot water myself for about 20 minutes to relax before shaving. the mirror is off to the side so that I don&#x27;t have to stand under the stream and shave, allowing me to lather up. Sure enough it had fogged up, but I had increased water temp &amp; it hadn&#x27;t been under the stream in that time. No problem as I grabbed it easily with wet soapy hands and held it in the stream for a few seconds and it was good for the entire shave. The few drops on the mirror afterwords were not a distraction from shaving.  As to my first impression, I was wrong, the size fits in your hand easily &amp; I didn&#x27;t have to touch at all while shaving my whole head, I do keep a light beard so I need the mirror for the trim detail and it worked perfect for that as well.</li>
    <li> This mirror is a great little product - works great and crystal clear! The best shaving mirror I have ever found. As with anything you use every day, products like this get the toughest reviews! This CLEARLY passes all my expectations! Hold it under the warm shower water before you use it and it really is fog free. Get it, you will use it every day and you&#x27;ll be happy with it too. Good job SHAVE WELL!!</li>
    <li> Purchased this mirror for an outdoor shower at the shore so my husband could shave out there. Didn&#x27;t want suction cups since they tend to fall off at times and didn&#x27;t want a broken mirror.  This was perfect.  My only complaint is that it is too small.  I didn&#x27;t realize how tiny it was.  Please make a larger version.</li>
    <li> It works as described. So far the finish seems reasonably durable but time will tell--this is basically just a piece of acrylic or polycarbonate or similar with a metalized face. I like that it&#x27;s light and compact. I don&#x27;t use mine exactly as designed--I use it for travel, so the single wall hook doesn&#x27;t really help me. I&#x27;m going to tie a cord and hook onto the mirror that I can use to hang it from hotel shower curtain hooks.</li>
    <li> Sometimes, simplicity is best.  This very afforable, simplistically-designed fog-free shower mirror gets the job done.  Installation was a breeze.  The manufacturer&#x27;s claims are valid:  Hold it under the shower stream for 3 - 5 seconds (I flip it to acclimate both sides well) and you get a crytal-clear reflection for 3 - 5 minutes (plenty of time for most shaves).  The morror is very lightweight and does not stress the double-sided foam tape used to mount the plastic hook.  The company&#x27;s customer service is exceptional.  I own a Mercedes and don&#x27;t get the kind of attention that I got from these guys.  If you want a simple and effective solution to shower shaving, this is a great consideration.</li>
    <li> When put under the water for a bit, this is fog free and stays that way for the whole shower. I didn&#x27;t use the hook because i rent and didn&#x27;t want to deal with that but was able to prop this up on a shelf in the shower. It&#x27;s not huge but it&#x27;s big enough for my boyfriend to shave. I might even use it to tweeze my eyebrows since I get good natural light in the shower!</li>
    <li> This this worked as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple. Easy. Light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer shaving in the shower, as my blades tend to last forever, and I never get tugging.&lt;br /&gt;And I never use shaving cream. So rather than feel my way, I now use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worked great.</li>
    <li> Small enough for travel, large enough for shaving. Works exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> To keep this fog free you hold it under the water for about a minute. Warmed up, it does not fog for several minutes. When it does begin to fog, just put it back under the water again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All these mirrors work under one of two principles. They either have a fog free coating or they the heat up. A mirror that is as warm as the water won&#x27;t fog up. The ones with the coating, a type of wax, must have it reapplied from time to time. They often provide a few samples of the wax then try to sell you more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works as advertised. The problem I had was you need a very bright room. I have two large, frosted windows in my bathroom and when the sun is out they provide plenty of light to see, but not enough to see in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a large bathroom and even if I turn on all the lights, I cannot see very well in the mirror. I had to throw it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this unless you have a very bright bathroom.</li>
    <li> Worked great for 24 hours. Then adhesive on hook gave out. Would recommend a suction cup version rather then this style.</li>
    <li> I thought this mirror was going to be perfect, it it thin, light weight and fog free. But, I am somewhat disappointed as the grey paint on the back is now flaking off. Have not had this product very long.</li>
    <li> Hang closer to the water and its less likely to fog. Mines opposite the shower head and I usually have to &#x27;de-fog&#x27; it once mid head shaving session, but I like it at that end of the shower so I can deal.</li>
    <li> I also bought this for my oldest son for Christmas and he loves it because it helps me shave in the shower with no problem.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this mirror. It was in his Christmas stocking, and hanging it was a cinch. And if we move, we can rehang it easily with 3M Command hooks.</li>
    <li> Not sure how I lived without this mirror for so long as it now saves me so much time. It mounts easily in the shower and works perfect. I am really liking having the ability to shave in the shower instead of in front of the sink. I used to have to wait till that mirror defogged from my shower before I could shave. Now it is all done right in the shower.</li>
    <li> Where have you been all of my life, oh fogless mirror?</li>
    <li> I really like it. It sticks on well too.</li>
    <li> This mirror may not fog in your steam room, but if you are taking a shower with it, do not get any water on it.  The water beads up on the mirror so you can&#x27;t see anything anyway, making it useless.  I tried the &amp;#34;heating up with hot water&amp;#34; trick but it was useless too.  Not only that the mirror is glass.  I ended up trashing it, rather than dropping it in the shower and having it break, since I have to pick it up to wipe it every 5 seconds.  I didn&#x27;t want the 7 years bad luck, not to mention a gash on my foot.</li>
    <li> Still fogs up for me some days, but I think it&#x27;s just my placement in the shower. Better than most other mirrors I&#x27;ve used though.</li>
    <li> I have been pleasantly surprised by this mirror. Quality is decent, performance is fine. What I also really appreciate about this is when I travel, this tends to be easier to pack and taking along that shaving assistance products, like shave cream, etc.  This has allowed me to pretty much give up on most of those products.</li>
    <li> This is a simple, affordable and very useful product. It works more or less as described but during the course of shaving you might have to hold the mirror under a stream of hot water multiple times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Before using the mirror for the first time, be sure to clean your surface thoroughly with rubbing alcohol and only then paste the hook onto the wall.</li>
    <li> The Shave Well Company a TRULY FOG FREE Shower Shave Mirror really does work as directed.  Make sure you follow the instructions/tips.  I love this item and I truly recommend!</li>
    <li> I think I was expecting something a little different. This mirror is pretty cheesy. It&#x27;s a thin mirror that hangs on a plastic hook and it&#x27;s only fog free for about 10 seconds.</li>
    <li> This is a great little mirror.  easy to install and so convenient with no worry of dropping and breaking.  It cleans easily with a little tooth paste and is truly fog free.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I have yet to find a truly fog free mirror. The product packaging says to hold mirror in shower stream on both sides of mirror to prevent it from fogging up. The best this does is give you a few extra seconds of fog free experience. This product&#x27;s true advantage over the competition (in my opinion) is that it does not attach with a suction cup. All my other fog free mirrors would eventually fall off the shower wall and break because the suction cup would innevitably let loose at some point. Instead, this product comes with a peel-n-stick hook that attaches to your shower wall. While some might see this as a negative, I have not been awoken at 3 am by a loud &amp;#34;thud&amp;#34; trying to figure out what just happened since using this mirror. Because it is completely flat, it is very easy to take on your travels. A cheap suction cup hook thrown in with your luggage allows you to hang it up in your hotel shower.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect. No fogging, easily held with a hole to slide your finger through, and nothing extra, just a mirror with a textured backing. This mirror is solid. I suggest warming mirror up with the hot water then wipe the front with a dry rag. This will give you a clear view for shaving in the shower. Keep the back of the mirror warm by running hot water over the back if it starts to fog.&lt;br /&gt;I have used 15 different mirrors that the women in my life have. None come close to this mirror. The $15 is money well spent because it took me 3 minutes less to shave. That&#x27;s 12 hours a year! Plus the savings on water. BUY THE MIRROR and enjoy your free time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost every fog free mirror there is out there for shaving in the shower and this by far is the best. Run it under warm water from your shower and you will experience a fog free shave every day. Mine&#x27;s going on year two, which is the longest I&#x27;ve ever had a fog free mirror that I didn&#x27;t wind up needing to squint into every morning as they normally develop a permanent &amp;#34;fog&amp;#34; on them.</li>
    <li> My husband asked for a shower shave mirror, and he said this is the best one ever.  Heat it up with the water, and it is truly fog free, just like it says.  great price.</li>
    <li> Was easy enough to hang up in the shower, but even after rinsing with shower-temperature water, the mirror was covered with droplets of water from the shower.  That, combined with middle-aged farsightedness (i.e., it has no magnification), made this mirror somewhat useless as a shower mirror.  I had high hopes for it, but after one use, put it in the trash (not even worth the postage of sending it back for a refund).</li>
    <li> THE BEST, LOVE IT, GOOD COMPANY TOO, LOVE THE FOLLOW UP EMAIL</li>
    <li> It fogs up in the shower when the water is hot, just like any other mirror. It&#x27;s a good sized mirror for the shower but I only gave it 2 stars because it doesn&#x27;t serve it&#x27;s purpose well if it fogs up during the shower.</li>
    <li> This mirror is smaller than I expected but they do sell a bigger one so I am too blame for not doing my research. This mirror is no frills and no gimmicks as advertised. It simply does not fog do to common science. Get it nice and warm hang it on the wall and start shaving. You may have to rewarm it up if your walls are cold like mine. For the price it is a great buy. The hook is a little ugly as its like a 3M sticky hook that you can buy anywhere, but I have not had any issues with it. However, I think I would have preferred a suction cup so I can remover it even though they rarely stay stuck.</li>
    <li> This a great littel mirror it gives you the best shave in the shower no fog at all great product at a cheap price.</li>
    <li> Still fogs up :(  even in not super hot showers it will still fog up. You can still use it as long as you keep wiping off..</li>
    <li> And I&#x27;ve tried them all. The &amp;#34;Sharper Image&amp;#34; jokes with the hot water attachment meant to circulate water through the plastic mirror frame. The hi-tech ones claiming to be made from special material or have a special coating that somehow doesn&#x27;t fog in the shower. None of them works any better than just a regular mirror in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one does. It&#x27;s not rocket science. Shave Well doesn&#x27;t insult your intelligence with hokum and magic, just common sense. Do as they say and warm the thing up under the hot water stream and it&#x27;ll stay relatively fog-free for the time it takes to shave. The mirror is a quality piece, the hook and adhesive are too, and the price is right. Good support from the company as well if you need some help or a replacement part.</li>
    <li> I use this with another fog less mirror I own so I can cut and shave my own hair in the shower. This is smaller than I expected but suits my needs. You do have to run it under hot water often though.</li>
    <li> Great product. Does exactly what you need it to do.</li>
    <li> Not exactly fog free.  The mirror is always fogged up for me.  Only time it is not fogged is when you run it under the water for a few mins.</li>
    <li> I wanted a shave mirror that was light and easy to use -- this is it. Because we have children, I didn&#x27;t want a heavy piece of glass that could hurt them if it fell; it&#x27;s very light, and it shows no sign of falling. The sticky hook is still holding fast after several showers and weeks. I just wanted a simple fog free mirror to put in the shower...this just works. The directions and explanations were clear (no pun intended). Thanks for a great and simple product!</li>
    <li> Buy a better one. Hook falls off after 2 weeks. Mirror too small to use unless your head is size of a tomatoes</li>
    <li> As other reviewer said, this really works if you follow the instruction. No fog, easy to clean.   Lighting @my shower space is not great, creating shadow on my face, which causes difficulty to shave.    This mirror does not need to be fixed on wall, simply hung on hook.  Although this is nothing to do with function of the mirror, flexibility to carry it around to be  in a right spot while shaving (very light) is also A plus feature for me.</li>
    <li> This thing works great in the shower.  Just hold it under the water for 4-5 seconds and you are ready to rock and roll, fog free!!  Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> This is my third shower mirror, the other two being different brands and more expensive, and this is by far, the best.  It works exactly as the ad says.  Run the shower water over it to equalize the temperature, and you have a truly fog free mirror.&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
    <li> This shower mirror hasn&#x27;t fogged up on me at all, so it works as described.  The size is a bit small and there is still plenty of water on the face of the mirror to impede your view a bit - but it&#x27;s not waterproof - I think a good application of RainX might help, then it&#x27;ll be perfect.  The mirror is fairly lightweight and the included hook holds it in place. Good mirror and I&#x27;ll plan to take it with me on trips.  Thanks Cumberland.</li>
    <li> I like this mirror because you can put the mirror on a separate self adhesive hook .  I&#x27;ve used both the suction cup type and the adhesive to the mirror type and after a few months they all fall.  I&#x27;ve been using this one for well over a year and it has yet to fall once. Just be careful when you place it in the shower. Make sure it&#x27;s exactly where you want and need it.  Nice product.</li>
    <li> Still fogs up but nice mirror.</li>
    <li> Update 01/2015  I never noticed the response until recently looking over one of my other reviews.  - In retrospect, I&#x27;m giving two stars back to this review.  - 1 star for something so inexpensive that lasted for so long, even though I got a rare defect compared to the other reviewers.  - 1 star for the customer service (which I won&#x27;t take advantage of, as I kind of moved away from shaving in the shower and don&#x27;t need it).    Old review:  It worked well for a year, but then the gray backing started peeling off so I had to throw it away as it lost its mirroring ability. It&#x27;s unfortunate because this was a great product in concept.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m not sure why they insist on claiming this product does something it doesn&#x27;t.  Use warm water, it steams.  End of story. (regardless of whether or not you spray the reverse side with warm water first)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that it is a decent sized mirror that has worked well for me.  Would have given it more stars if not for the highly deceptive advertising surrounding product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product at a great price. The concept is simple... warm up the mirror by holding it under the shower for a few seconds and since it&#x27;s warm you don&#x27;t get condensation. Works like a charm with no gimmicks and mercifully, no suction cups. Also had pleasant follow-up contact from the seller, much more personalized than a simple automated response. Great experience!</li>
    <li> This mirror is TRULY FOG FREE and inexpensive unlike other \\&quot;fog free\\&quot; mirrors.  Finally, a mirror that does what it says it will do!  It&#x27;s very simple, hold it under the shower for 2-4 seconds before you shave and \\&quot;voila\\&quot; it does not fog up!  The mirror is very lightweight, a bit smaller than I was expecting, but the measurements are clearly depicted in the product description 4\\&quot; x 6\\&quot;, like a photo.  I am a HUGE fan of the small plastic hook that sticks to the wall versus the suction cups.  No more falling off the wall in the middle of the night!!  I highly recommend this shaving mirror.</li>
    <li> I just had this mirror delivered today.  I guess you do get what you pay for.  The size of the mirror is so SMALL, I had to laugh hysterically!!!!  It is beyond me how it ever got 4.5 stars.  Had I known it was this small, I guess I should have ordered four (4) and glued them up on my tile!!  Glad there are some things we can still laugh about.</li>
    <li> Very small,  looks bigger in the pictures.  Cheaply made.  Still fogs in the shower,  I need to keep putting under water to get the fog off.  However,  it&#x27;s is only $10.</li>
    <li> Many of these shaving mirrors are over-designed and unnecessarily costly. This item is a jewel. Best value, simple, easy to mount, easy to use. Some talk about it being small. It is but I can see my whole face in it no problem. Works as advertised. When you&#x27;re in a shower with water and steam, you are NOT going to get a dry surface; this gives you an easy to see, simple to de-fog, low profile solution. Bottom line, for the money, give it a shot and make your own decision.</li>
    <li> The mirror is a bit on the small side but it works great. They email with ways to make it last for years. I am buying another one for my other bathroom. Recommended!!!</li>
    <li> Great product, have had some more expensive ones that fall and break easily in the shower this product is made to be thrown around. Perfect size and adhesive for mounting works well.</li>
    <li> It worked exactly as advertised. I have no complaints and would definitely recommend it to others. I am sure once you get yours you will feel the same way.</li>
    <li> For those of us males who blade shave, shaving in the shower is the holy grail, as the wetter and softer the beard the better.   I&#x27;d tried two different no-fog treatments for our vanity mirror, Rain-ex liquid and a paste called Brite Sight that came in a yellow tub and was sold many years ago at fairs and flea markets, I still had a 20+ yr old tub laying around and said \\&quot;what the hell\\&quot;. Results were both the same. They both did merely \\&quot;OK\\&quot; on fog but failed after one treatment.  So I decided to part with 10 bucks and try this mirror.   I was initially a bit concerned as to whether the hanger adhesive would stick to our uneven ceramic tiles but I just picked a flat(er) section and it stuck, no problem.  As to performance, it works exactly as advertised. When you&#x27;re ready to shave, hold it under the hot shower for a few seconds and you have a fog free mirror for the duration.  I shave with a 50 yr old Gillette double edged adjustable (best razor ever made IMO) so there&#x27;s the whole shaving bowl, (or mug) badger brush and razor juggle to deal with, but the palm sized, light weight mirror was a breeze to get used to.   As to the size issue a few others have complained about. I don&#x27;t get it. The description states that it&#x27;s 4\\&quot;x6\\&quot; no surprises. The mirror is slightly convex (like the passenger side mirror on your car) and I can see my whole face from about 18\\&quot; away and I&#x27;ve got a pretty big head.  So all in all, it works great, it only costs $10. Inexpensive solution to a difficult problem. What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> Bar none, the best I&#x27;ve tried.  Excellent quality mirror and no crappy suction cups that fall off of the wall.  Excellent product, excellent price, perfect!</li>
    <li> works well when you read the directions.  customer service is quite impressive as they did everything short of showing up to my house to show me how to use it correctly.</li>
    <li> I have not used the enclosed hook for this mirror because I found it more convenient to hang it on the suction cup razor holder we have. That makes it perfect because my husband and I can both use it at whatever height we need to adjust it to. On a cold winter morning with a hot steamy shower it stays fog free for about 10 minutes before you have to hold it under the water again.</li>
    <li> I had read reviews on this product before I bought it and many people complained about the mirror fogging up and did not work, well they didn&#x27;t read the directions very well.  You have to stick the hook on just like it said, put hook on and press for 10 sec. and let stand over night for better hold.  Than when you take a shower the next day , get the mirror all fogged up for 3 ssc. and than run it under the shower and hang up.  Thats all! If I could I would have given it 10 stars.</li>
    <li> I really loved this shower mirror.  It worked exactly as described and includes idiot-proof instructions.  A bit smaller than I expected, but that&#x27;s only b/c I didn&#x27;t read the dimensions first.</li>
    <li> It requires wetting first and rewetting often.  I don&#x27;t mean to sound like a mirror snob, but there are other mirrors out there that have no fog ever.</li>
    <li> My husband has a very rough beard and therefore must shave in the shower.  We have tried every gimmick there is, including expensive mirrors from sharper image and Brookstone.  I wish we would have found this years ago.  Hubby says that it works perfect, doesn&#x27;t fog, stays completely clear, genius!</li>
    <li> This really does work great. A little bit of a pain to have to warm it up in the water before using it but it really does make life easier. Only real complaint is my own fault and that&#x27;s I wish I looked at the overall size because this thing is kind of small. It works great though.</li>
    <li> Nope, still get plenty of fog.</li>
    <li> We all have those products that we wish we never would have bought because it was a waste of money. For me, this isn&#x27;t one of them. This is one of those products that I use every day and one of those purchases that i&#x27;m glad I made. This mirror takes a no-nonsense approach to eliminating fog on a shower mirror, unlike many others that involve batteries or filling a reservoir with water before use. It&#x27;s simply a mirror and a hook that attaches to your shower wall. If it fogs up, all you do it take it off the hook, run it under the shower water and the fog is gone. It&#x27;s a fog free shaving mirror and it does what it says.</li>
    <li> I bought this so I could shave in the shower and it works good.  It comes with a hook to hang it but I prefer to hold it and it works very good.  Priced right too!</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband. Hangs right on the shower caddy..he holds it during use. Mirror is really clear &amp; stayed fog-free. So simple, but great little product when you follow directions to keep fog free.</li>
    <li> FOGS UP ALMOST ALL THE TIME...NOT WORTH THE COST OF THIS PLASTIC MIRROR.</li>
    <li> Pay attention to the size before you order. I assumed it would be bigger and was a little disappointed. Obviously, this is my fault, but I wanted to include it in my review to possibly help someone out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it&#x27;s great. Exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Its a nice little mirror, but it does still fog up after a few minutes of use. Good product for the price though.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product, my husband loves it for shaving. It is not too big and fits perfectly in our shower. The company seems to be top notch and eager to help, although we did not need to contact them.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t seem to figure out how to get proper value out of this mirror. Once you fix it&#x27;s location, you can&#x27;t move it. If I need to change the angle, I have to remove the mirror from the hanger and hold it in my hand, which is very inconvenient.</li>
    <li> It works just great!! Use it almost every day,( hate to shave on the weekends)  THATS ALLL I HAVE TO SAY</li>
    <li> I have lived with this for a few months now - and absolutely love it. Some people complain about it falling off the wall or mounting surface. I&#x27;ve mounted mine to the drywall above the top of my tub and it isn&#x27;t going anywhere. I also believe they intended for experimentation with different size/design of hooks to be used with this item given the size of the hole you attach it to the hook with. I was formerly using the 3M $7 version of a shower mirror and was replacing every several weeks. This one kicks the 3M&#x27;s ass up and down the block.    Don&#x27;t think of this as a fogless mirror - think of it as a solution for shaving in the shower. Because, if you are looking for a mirror that never fogs-up, I think you&#x27;re going to be disappointed no matter what you buy. I haven&#x27;t found one yet.    You can travel with it and hold it by hand if need be. If you&#x27;re a head shaver, you&#x27;ll need to hang this thing somehow, but a quick trip to a hardware store could easily solve this for your travel needs.    They also follow up with you after your purchase to make sure you&#x27;re happy with the product and offer suggestions for best performance (I still haven&#x27;t tried their toothpaste trick for restoring the mirror to out-of-box condition as I haven&#x27;t had to yet). They actually care about the product and all they have is 12 of your dollars. I can&#x27;t get that kind of \\&quot;give-a-s***\\&quot; out of companies I pay hundreds to for their products!!    Might buy another just to keep w/my toiletries. This is an A+ solution to dealing with foggy mirrors in the shower.</li>
    <li> The standard sticky-back mount that came with the mirror kept falling off my bathroom wall, despite following the directions. The company was VERY responsive to my complaint, though. They sent me a new stick-back mount. When that still didn&#x27;t work, they sent me a suction-cup mount which works great. I took off a star because of the hassle that I went through to finally get a working product.</li>
    <li> I received an unsolicited email from the manufacturer giving me helpful information and offering to answer any questions I might have. This level of customer service is rare indeed. I thanked them for the email but had no questions and just wanted to let them, and anyone else, know that I love the mirror. I followed directions on mounting and have had no problems and don&#x27;t expect any. I use the mirror daily and love it.</li>
    <li> When in the market for a fog free shower mirror, I couldn&#x27;t help but order this one. How in the world did this mirror get so many reviews?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re happy with the product. It does still fog up but clears for a decent amount of time when wiped.</li>
    <li> Follow the instructions to eliminate the fog.</li>
    <li> simple and it works. It travels well</li>
    <li> Works like a champ and very convenient for me since I travel often.</li>
    <li> Worked great for a few months but then the fog free effect began to weaken.  Just a cheap mirror at this point.</li>
    <li> Great functional mirror. Simple enough to hold in hand or hang on hook. I find, however, that I need to spray the water on the mirror a few times rather than just the 2-3 seconds. Also, the adhesive is not heavy duty, so I had to use other 3M brand heavy duty. But beyond this, the mirror itself is quick and easy, doesn&#x27;t take up too much space and is portable. I also use when I give myself a haircut.</li>
    <li> I was just looking for something small/handy for shaving in the shower. This fits the bill perfectly. The company is also very helpful by sending info on how to best use the mirror. It&#x27;s small enough that I can hold in one hand and shave with the other. The fog-free nature is pretty decent. Probably the best I&#x27;ve ever had actually (used about 4-5 over the past 10 years).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely with the money if you like to shave in the shower.</li>
    <li> This thing is so simple to use and set up.  And cheap too.  I will buy another one when needed.</li>
    <li> No shower mirror is truly fog free due to condensation which occurs in most every shower. What is good about this one is that it rests on a simple hook. As a result it can be held under the water to equalize the temperature and reduce condensation. Also, you don&#x27;t have to wait to hear that dreaded sound of the suction mirror falling off the wall in the middle of the night.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what you want it to do. Hook is sturdy and once you run the mirror under hot water before every shower it stays very clear - perfect for shaving in the shower.  I would give it five stars regardless, but as a bonus received this information from the vendor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Your Shave Well package was assembled in the USA by the good folks at Sunshine Industries, a vocational training facility for people with a wide variety of disabilities, including intellectual disabilities, mental illness, autism, emotional and behavioral disorders and learning disabilities.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;which makes it even better. Thanks!</li>
    <li> small but decent mirror.  it fogs up !</li>
    <li> Its the first I&#x27;ve come across that works. its simplicity is its biggest attribute. nothing special, its just square piece of mirror but it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for about a month now.  It works great and I love shaving in the shower.  Get a better, more comfortable and faster shave with no fuss or mess or costly shaving cream.  Cannot believe I spent decades wasting money on shaving cream and time rinsing the sink after shaving every morning.  It hangs on a hook on my shower caddy but I use it hand held.  It&#x27;s easier to move the mirror in my left hand while shaving with my right, particularly since my shower isn&#x27;t well lit.  Also, the vendor sent a thoughtful email between placing the order and the products arrival with tips on use that was helpful. Definitely a 5 star product at the price.</li>
    <li> The Shave Well Company does an excellent job with this product.  It&#x27;s inexpensive and works like a charm if you just follow the directions.  I, like others, am using a 3M bath hook instead of the one that comes with it.  I&#x27;m not sure if that one will come off as easily.  It seems the people that have problems just aren&#x27;t following the directions and it&#x27;s not that big of a deal to run water over the mirror, even if it&#x27;s twice during one shower.  It&#x27;s so much better than that $40 lighted ones I bought (and got taken for).  I like being able to take it off the hook if needed too which is why it&#x27;s the size it is.  Seems small, but once you start using it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> Simple design, not aesthetically pretty, or ugly, just does the job.  I&#x27;ve tried many \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirrors over the years and this one really works.  Just a nice quality plastic mirror on a hook.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about five months now and it&#x27;s working just fine, no loss of reflection, no stains or water spots.  Two suggestions for improvement:  1) make the mirror just an inch wider and longer, and 2) the protective film that needs to be removed before use is REALLY hard to remove (nearly impossible to grab an edge, though comes off fine once started), would be helpful if there was a tab of some sort to grab onto to peel the film off.  Since the product works fine as is, I don&#x27;t take stars away, just suggestions for improvement.  Great product!  If you have trouble removing the top film, be persistent, it does come off but it took me awhile, and careful use of a box-cutter blade on the edge, to get it started.&lt;br /&gt;Update Nov 7 2012:  Still works great but has a soapy film; discovered a light buff with a Magic Eraser cleaning sponge cleans the mirror perfectly!</li>
    <li> I was impressed that the company went to such great lengths to ensure that we knew how to use their product most effectively.  With the detailed instructions that came with it, the product is almost foolproof (note that I say almost since I&#x27;m sure some people won&#x27;t follow the instructions and then say it doesn&#x27;t work properly).</li>
    <li> Well it&#x27;s sort of fog free... I bought this mirror to hang in my shower for shaving. Although it works better than any other &amp;#34;fog free&amp;#34; mirror I&#x27;ve owned, it&#x27;s still not fog free. I follow the directions to the tee and within the first few minutes I have to repeat the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The back of the mirror has been flaking off and I&#x27;m really not impressed. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> This mirror was easy to put up in the shower. When following the instructions that came with it, it did not fog at all. It worked very well and I would definitely recommend it for folks who like shaving in the shower.</li>
    <li> Just wanted to give my 5 stars to this product.  The other reviewers have already reviewed everything about this nifty item.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this mirror. No unnecessary fancy add-ons jacking up the price of an otherwise worthless mirror that isn&#x27;t really fog free. This is a truly fog free mirror. The technology behind it works. Now my husband shaves in the shower and doesn&#x27;t get stubble all over the sink! Thank you! My only request would be that this product comes with a better adhesive hook. The one provided didn&#x27;t last too long taking hot showers, but we just replaced the hook with a higher quality 3M hook. The mirror is the important part of the purchase anyhow.</li>
    <li> The Shower Shave Mirror is a simple, rectangular mirror that is sturdy in design and hangs on a plastic hook in your shower.  This is much better than an attached mirror because you have the option of just hanging it and using it or picking it up to get a better angle or a closer look.  The mirror is fog free.  I read the previous reviews and even received an email from the Shave Well Company that informed me on how to use the mirror correctly.  There are also instructions in the box itself, so those who complained that it wasn&#x27;t fog-free just didn&#x27;t read the instructions.  I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the mirror for about a month now. It works exactly as promised. Just follow the directions and you won&#x27;t be dissappointed.</li>
    <li> I got this mirror to finally be able to shave in the shower to help eliminate irritation and have a better shaving experience. This is what it says it is and at the same time its not what it says it is. By default, it isn&#x27;t fog free. You have to \\&quot;heat\\&quot; up the mirror with the hot water of your shower for a few seconds to \\&quot;activate\\&quot; it. This works ok for a minute but I have found you have to do this multiple times if you breathe on the mirror or are very close to it, which you will be since your using it to shave. It&#x27;s very compact mirror, smaller than I originally expected. It truly wont fall off the wall. It comes with a adhesive hook to hang on. So I am glad I can finally shave in the shower but it is very annoying to be in the middle of a shave and the fog sets in and you have to stop and run water over the front and back again and again. If it wasnt a pain to send this back, even though Amazon&#x27;s return policies are awesome, getting it packed back up and to the post office is a pain in my small town. I would like to try a different one but I&#x27;m not going to waste my time. IT works, just not how I imagined.</li>
    <li> I bought this product about 6 months ago and it has becoming less &#x27;fogless&#x27; over time. I think for the first month it was great and then it has been drastically declining ever since. I currently can not see anything out of the mirror at all in normal temperature (there doesn&#x27;t even have to be fog or steam in the room). I think it&#x27;s just time for me to realize that it&#x27;s not scientifically possible to make a &#x27;fogless&#x27; product.</li>
    <li> When I first pulled the mirror out the box, I was surprised to find the mirror smaller than I anticipated.  After using it, I discovered the size to be perfect.  It&#x27;s large enough to see my whole face while saving, and small enough to fit in my tolietry bag when traveling.  It doesn&#x27;t have that haze that other fog free mirrors have.  After a few weeks the hook fell off the tile wall in the shower.  I added a stronger adhesive to the hook and reapplied it to wall.  No problem since.  Even though the mirror went crashing down to the tub below, it never broke or even chipped. It&#x27;s a tuff little mirror. I&#x27;d buy this product again, but I&#x27;d use a different adhesive for the hook.  The company also provides great customer service.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Sounds silly on something so simple, but I have bought $20-80 mirrors that fog up and fall after a few weeks.  This one I have had for a couple months now, and is working perfectly and exactly as advertised!  It&#x27;s very simple but it just works.  Just take it off it&#x27;s peg, run it under hot water for a few seconds and put it back, stays clear for the rest of the shower!</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this item. Love it, but replace the hook which is permanent with a suction cup hook so I can travel with it.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised! Use it in the shower and it works just as it is marketed.</li>
    <li> Just a mirror and NOT FOG FREE</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned one of these for 2.5 years.  I&#x27;ve used both the regular and the deluxe size of this mirror.  The deluxe size is definitely nicer in terms of seeing my whole big face in there, but for just normal face shaving, the regular (smaller) one works fine.  I own the normal one, and use it daily.  I&#x27;ve bought deluxe ones for my father and my brother, and use them when I visit (self serving gifts for the win!).  If I were to recommend one, I&#x27;d definitely recommend the deluxe, but I still just own and use the regular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, the mirror is great.  It&#x27;s pretty simple..  A piece of acrylic, with the mirror surface on the back side of the acrylic (which makes it sensitive to scratching.. see below).  Not much to it.  If you have a drafty shower, it will fog up significantly faster..  Also, I use a cheap suction cup + plastic hook that I picked up at Target, rather than the included hook (which uses some double-sided foam tape).  Mostly because I was going to be traveling with the thing and moving it around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve dropped the mirror in a tile shower from 5+ feet DOZENS of times, and it&#x27;s still in one piece.  It makes a heck of a noise, but it has never broken, chipped, etc.  It&#x27;s acrylic, it&#x27;s pretty tough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing to note with the mirror, is that it can scratch if you don&#x27;t treat it carefully.  If you push it around on hard surfaces, it will totally scratch.  It&#x27;s nothing to really be surpised about, but just be aware, if you happen to throw it lazily into a travel bag, etc.  Since the back (reflective mirror material) side isn&#x27;t protected, you could wind up with scratches in the mirror image.  Mine got a few scratches from me treating it like it was indestructible, so I now treat it much nicer.  Just saying.  The simplicity and the &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; feature has the drawback of the unprotected surfaces, so just be careful with it.  If you put it in your shower, and never move it, it will not scratch.  You literally need to be putting it on hard surfaces, etc, or where it can rub against hard stuff.  I move mine around between showers, traveling, etc, so it has seen more mileage than most, I&#x27;m sure.  Again, I&#x27;ve owned one for 2.5 years, and in that time, it picked up 2 scratches in the actual mirror material (shows up at thin black lines when looking in the mirror), and a few scratches on the front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it will collect water droplets, when you rinse it / warm it up.  If you are so inclined, you could wax the surface with car wax, or something..?  No idea how that would hold up in the long run..  I surely didn&#x27;t do that!  For me, if there are way too many water droplets, I put it into the shower stream again, and try for a less obvious pattern.  I really don&#x27;t notice the droplets after a moment, though.  I also have hard water, and the mirror hasn&#x27;t had any problems with water marks, and I&#x27;ve never needed to or attempted to clean it..  Maybe the near-daily rinse keeps it fresh.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Really clear and for a guy like me that only has vision in one eye, this is excellent.  Great price as well.</li>
    <li> Very convenient mirror. It is small but nice it doesnt take up a lot of space. Sticks right in our shower door and has not fallen off in many many months. Just hold it under the shower water for a quick second and it will stay fog free and clear. Hubby is happy with this for a quick shave in the shower.</li>
    <li> Works pretty good, have been using it for months without an issue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving in a shower for over 40 years.  In that time, I&#x27;ve purchased at least one shaving mirror a year, with space age coatings, transistor radios, lights, ones that hooked into the plumbing, ones \\&quot;guaranteed to never fog\\&quot; and they are all, in the immortal words of Animal House \\&quot;worthless and weak\\&quot;.  For the last several months, I&#x27;ve been shaving blind, which is one of my worst ideas ever.&lt;br /&gt;These guys, however, have solved the Rubik&#x27;s Cube.  I&#x27;ve only had this for less than a week, but it does exactly what it says it will do.  Running the shower water over the \\&quot;mirror\\&quot; creates a shiny reflective surface that is bright and clear.  I find the size perfect for holding in my hand while I shave, but I&#x27;m liking hanging it back on the wall-it is remarkably bright and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be curious to see how it holds up, but if you&#x27;re in the market, don&#x27;t waste your money on these other products.  They&#x27;re all spiffy for a few months, then they give up the ghost and quit working.&lt;br /&gt;The Shave Well is just that.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I&#x27;m not sold on is the sticky hook deal.. My shower is quarry stone, so I&#x27;ve had a screw mount for years.  Works fine for this mirror.  I am skeptical that the hook will actually stick for the long run to a shower wall, but with fiberglass being sort of the standard shower wall, probably not much choice.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving in the shower for 20 years.  I&#x27;ve had a few mirrors, some better than others, but none great.  This one is great.  The fact that its temperature matches that of the shower in seconds, and therefore prevents condensation, is brilliant.  The only downside is that my hook didn&#x27;t stay attached to the wall.  Not sure if I didn&#x27;t give it enough time, or the adhesive didn&#x27;t like my tile.  Now I rest it on a ledge which is the perfect height for me.  One tip:  if you squeegee the mirror after it&#x27;s been sprayed, it becomes crystal clear.  I have a glass door on my shower which I squeegee after every shower, so I had one already.</li>
    <li> Well, it kinda works. But not all that great. and Definitely not how they say it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have a beard. And it&#x27;s ALL THEIR FAULT.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for about eight months. While its defogging ability is OK, holding it under the water to warm it up does leave many water droplets that distort the view; shaking it just breaks these up into tinier drops, which is worse--but this is no better or worse than other fogless mirrors I&#x27;ve had. The bigger problem, however, is that the stick-on hook eventually fails. After applying it according to the directions, the hook was fine until about two weeks ago, when it fell off the tile wall--now no amount of coaxing will keep it stuck on. Holding it in one hand while you shave is a pain. A reasonable short-term solution, but that&#x27;s about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Shave Well contacted me immediately after this review was posted and offered to send a new hook--thanks! They did seem to think, however, that eight months was a long period of time for the hook adhesive to last. For comparison, I had my last fogless shaving mirror for over twenty years--through two moves (for which the manufacturer supplied additional adhesive strips)--and it NEVER came off the wall. The last move was sixteen years ago, and the manfacturer seems to have gone out of business--probably because their product lasted too long. I had to replace it because the fogless feature finally deteriorated to the point of uselessness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another Update: Shave Well did indeed live up to their promise, and sent both an adhesive and a suction hook. Thanks, Shave Well!</li>
    <li> Its OK, not what I was expecting but not their fault. Works fairly well, though. If is gets foggy just hit it with the hot shower water and you are good to again. The hook it hangs on makes it easy for moving the mirror if you dont feel standing in the same place while shaving. You get what you pay for, not great and not bad.</li>
    <li> The adhesive (not the backing, just the adhesive) on the hook came off it.  This happened shortly after I installed it, it just fell down into the tub.  At least the plastic mirror didn&#x27;t break.</li>
    <li> The mirror itself serves it&#x27;s purpose well enough, but the plastic mounting hook it came with only managed to stay stuck to my shower wall for 6 months before coming crashing down.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror because of the great reviews and because I of course needed a shaving mirror for the shower that wouldn&#x27;t fog up.  I have tried many \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; shave mirrors and still have not found one that lives up to it&#x27;s claims.    Pros:  -Easy installation (You just stick the hook on the wall, and that&#x27;s it.)  -Lightweight/Durable (I feel like if I dropped this while in the shower, it wouldn&#x27;t get damaged like some other shave mirrors.)  -Would work with any sticky backed mounting hook if anything were to happen to the original.    Cons:  -It fogs up!  I followed the instructions and held the mirror under the hot shower for about 30 seconds on each side, hung it up, and started to shave.  About 1/2 my face in to the shave it started fogging up on one side, then by the time I was on my upper lip it was totally fogged over.  I had to stop, re-warm the mirror and put it back up.. and I&#x27;m a fairly quick shaver.  -Small (Like really small, the picture doesn&#x27;t convey how small this thing is.)    Conclusion:  I think because of all the stellar reviews I had my expectations set too high.  I should have known that there is no miracle mirror that doesn&#x27;t fog up.  I will stick with this mirror just because of the simple mounting and the fact that I&#x27;m pretty sure it will never fall off the wall.  I have modified my review to 5 stars.    UPDATE 1/7/2015:  Well it&#x27;s been about 2.5 years and I&#x27;ve used this shaving mirror every day since I got it.  I figured out that if I hold it under the water for about a minute, the mirror won&#x27;t fog up during use.  I also got a new shower curtain that doesn&#x27;t let in as much cold air.</li>
    <li> I was pretty disappointed by this product. I&#x27;ve used the Zadro ZM01 happily for years (though you have to replace them pretty often). But I saw the reviews for this and thought I&#x27;d try something new. The size is ok, and I like the hook mount better than the Zadro suction cups (though I haven&#x27;t had this up for very long, so I don&#x27;t know how the hook will perform over the long haul in the shower). And following the instructions, the mirror does indeed not FOG, as advertised. However, the surface of the mirror also does not shed water, and so the mirror is constantly covered in tiny water droplets, both left over from \\&quot;heating\\&quot; it under the hot water (as the instructions require) and from just being in the shower. So while there is no condensation or fog on the mirror, the actual water on the mirror makes it of little use. The reflection is not clear and unobstructed. Very frustrating. The Zadro ZM01 mirror has some kind of coating on it that the water sheds off of it leaving the surface clear and unobstructed, for a far better shaving reflection. The coating on the Zadro breaks down pretty quickly, and the surface gets scuffed easily, so I find myself replacing the Zadro a couple of times a year. I thought this mirror might change all that. But I&#x27;ll be heading back to the Zadro. I&#x27;d rather have a mirror that works well out of the box, even if it has a limited life span.</li>
    <li> It works. Just a little expensive for what it is.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s smaller than I thought it would be</li>
    <li> I withheld writing a review on this until I could observe how it held up over time.  The anti-fog coasting began degrading about a 9 months of use in the shower and at the one year point it has become pretty much useless.  I just ordered another brand as a replacement.  If you purchase, just be prepared that it is disposable after 9 months of use or so.</li>
    <li> Does what it claims, easy to install, stays fog-free better than the 3M Command mirror. I wish it were about 25% larger, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: We&#x27;ve been using it for 6 months. It is still about 95% fog-free if you follow the instructions. The hook is still attached to the tile. Water spots are easily wiped off.</li>
    <li> I used this for years, very good quality, affordable and simple. The manufacturers are highly responsive with warranty and support and very nice people. I wish more products were like this.</li>
    <li> All of the other fog free mirrors Ive ordered fog up after a months use.  This one stays fog free going on six months now.</li>
    <li> Was a little smaller than I expected,but that comes with ordering off internet. Very nice though and the size works well. Works like it says Fog Free. Very happy with price and quality.</li>
    <li> The mirror works just as advertised--it is convenient, light, easy to defog by warming under running hot water, and has resulted in fewer nicks and a better shave.</li>
    <li> Best shower mirror I&#x27;ve ever used. My own personal tip is instead of warming up the mirror, just used a little lather from your soap.</li>
    <li> I have had this mirror in my possession for about a month and half. The reflective coating is peeling off of back of mirror which in turn makes bad viewing from the front.&lt;br /&gt;The anti-fog works perfectly, couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated 7-20-12:  The Shave Well company stands behind there product 100%&lt;br /&gt;  They replace my defective mirror without hesitation.&lt;br /&gt;  This is a Real Good Company. They honestly care about there products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned many so-called fogless mirrors over the years and this one, is hands down, the best.  I thought it was a little small when I first got it but I honestly don&#x27;t notice any more.  Works great and as advertised.  I should never have gotten all those other \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirrors.</li>
    <li> i would buy this again however the quality isnt exaclty the greatest.  but given the fact it sits in the shower i think it does the trick.  it is used to shave face in the shower.  after about six months you can still see in it but the bottom has chipped away so that it is no longer a mirror at the bottom half inch or so.  no big deal to me as i can still see in it.  not sure if there is a better one out there to buy that is why i say i would buy again.</li>
    <li> I have used this since March 2012. just warm it up by running the hot shower water over it for 30 seconds and it is fog free.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mirror for a little over 3 months now. It works as advertised - I just hold it under the warm water for several seconds and it remains fog-free throughout my shave. There is now just under 1/8th of an inch of the gray coating on the back that has flaked off from the bottom edge on back. If it continues at this rate, it&#x27;ll be 1/4&amp;#34; in another 3 months and 1/2&amp;#34; after a year at which point it will have surpassed being an eyesore and will continue to reduce the usable area.  My suggestion to the manufacturer is to apply an additional hard coating on the back AND OVER THE EDGES to increase durability. Even if this adds a dollar to the selling price, it would be well worth it to avoid having to buy another one every year or two. Then again, maybe that&#x27;s what they WANT you to do! &amp;#34;Planned obsolescence.&amp;#34;  UPDATE 2/6/15: Following my original complaint about the gray coating on back peeling off, I was sent a replacement mirror at no charge by The Shave Well Company. The coating on the original mirror only peeled about 3/16&amp;#34; before stopping. It hasn&#x27;t peeled any more. I couldn&#x27;t ask for better customer service and I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this mirror. I&#x27;m now changing my rating from 3 stars to 5 stars.  UPDATE 2/9/17: It&#x27;s now been over 4-1/2 years and I&#x27;m still using the original mirror. A little more of the gray coating peeled off, but it&#x27;s still perfectly usable.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend he loves it, its really fog free once you place under hot water for a few seconds its definitly worth the price its great.</li>
    <li> This is a very handy mirror. We use it and have it hanging in our bathroom but unfourtanely this mirror does indeed fog up so I have to constanly wipe it down. this is ok with me but it doesnt quite do as the description described. :(</li>
    <li> If used properly, as per the included instructions, this mirror will not fog up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve been misled by the razor blade and shaving cream makers into believing that their more modern inventions are better than a wet shave with shave soap and a good safety razor.  Truth is, it&#x27;s not better.  Go back to the older, cheaper, way.  You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get my fog free mirror.  It was smaller than I thought it would be, by that&#x27;s my fault for not paying attention to the dimensions. I cleaned the shower wall even though it was NOT dirty.  We moved into a new house 2 weeks ago. I dried the wall off and waited a couple of hours to make sure the wall was dry.  I took the mirror off the hook and stuck the hook on the wall.  I held the hook in place for about 2 minutes, alot longer than the instructions stated. I left the hook on the wall without attaching the mirror for about 4 hours. I didn&#x27;t want the little weight of the mirror pulling the hook off. After 4 hours I attached the mirror and took a shower.  10 minutes after getting out of the shower the hook and mirror fell off the wall!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily the mirror didn&#x27;t break but the adhesive on the hook was NOT even sticky!!  I was going to use super glue on the hook but decided not to. I just threw away the hook.  I now use the mirror holding it in 1 hand and shaving with the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror does fog back up while in the shower but run water over the mirror while showering and it clears back up for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last mirror I had in the shower lasted me for over 2 years.  I had purchased it from a large discount store but they no longer sell them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing that the hook did NOT work.</li>
    <li> Item does what is says. An extra run under the hot may be needed sometimes, which is no big deal. FYI  If you have hard water and don&#x27;t wipe down the mirror every time it&#x27;s used ,you will get hard to remove water spots that build up over time. Rubbing vigorously with household cleaners and a paper towel or piece of cloth does nothing or makes it worst. I&#x27;ve found that a little \\&quot;Novus\\&quot; plastic polish, ( that I happen to have ) does a nice job of removing those water marks without scratching the surface.</li>
    <li> Check the advertised dimensions.  This thing is too small to view your whole face at once.  I plan to return it.</li>
    <li> This product is fantabulous. The guy looking back at me, he has the eyes of a stranger. But each day after I shave my face, he looks much more familiar. I can do it without any help now, all by myself. No more nicks and cuts, because I can see what I&#x27;m doing. Good thing it doesn&#x27;t fog up on me.</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t much to it, but it does exactly what it needs to do. The nice thing is it&#x27;s real easy to take it off to run it under the shower to defog it. Takes only seconds.</li>
    <li> My husband LOVES this product! It’s just the right size, suction cup holds it firmly in place and yes, it is truly fog less!!!</li>
    <li> Fog free, yes.  But way too small.  It is a good price and there is no false advertisement.  Just be sure you want a mirror that small.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent more on fog-free mirrors, but I like this one for its simplicity.  When it&#x27;s foggy, I place it under the stream of warm water from the shower head, and it clears right up.  I bought a suction-cup hook to hang it on.  I&#x27;d also recommend taking a suction-cup bathroom hook with you when you travel to make it easy to use this mirror in hotels or other people&#x27;s homes.</li>
    <li> Easy to install and works as advertised.</li>
    <li> As long as you read and follow the directions it&#x27;s perfect for shaving in the shower</li>
    <li> Love this, it is movable and hot water removes the fog, can shave while in the shave.  During cold months, I think this is a plus!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve purchased other fogless mirrors, you&#x27;ll understand and agree that most eventually begin to fog and with some, the backing begins to peel away or stain black.  In addition, most are attached with suction cups which hinder easy removal for cleaning the wall behind the mirror.  This mirror solves these problem.  It&#x27;s easily attached at any desired height and when warmed with the shower water, it doesn&#x27;t fog.  In addition, you have a very clear, spotless view and is easily cleaned.  I wish I had found this years ago.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Wanted something to allow me to shave in the shower with my new electric. This works great, just follow the instructions. Fog free for the duration of my shave in a tiny bathroom with poor ventilation. It could be bigger, but hey, it&#x27;s $10. Stores are selling anti-fog mirrors for 40+. Buy it!</li>
    <li> I was looking on the internet for another shower mirror after the cleaning lady destroyed mine. I came across the Shave Well Company and gave them a telephone call. I was surprised to speak with the owner, he answered all my questions and gave me a lot of information on his product.  I ordered two of his mirrors and had a slight problem with the larger deluxe mirror. I called the company and they sent out a replacement no questions asked! About two weeks later I received telephone call from the company just to follow up on the status of the replacement mirror. I am not used to such good customer service these days!!  The mirrors work great, thank you Shave Well Company I will be ordering more mirrors in the future (travel, guest bathroom, gifts).</li>
    <li> It is a cheap peice of plastic that fogs up like 10 seconds after running it under the hot water (like the instructions say to do), and less than a week after hanging it in my shower, the &amp;#34;mirror&amp;#34; backing started flaking off and sticking to my brand new shower.. Very disappointed..</li>
    <li> I was attracted to the design of this mirror, as I have had to relinquish a couple great fog free shower mirrors in the past due to it being adhered to the shower wall too securely. With this design, all I need to do it buy a new hook should I move.&lt;br /&gt;Well, compared to other mirrors, this one disappoints. It&#x27;s always foggy unless you rinse it off often. LAME. I would not recommend this mirror at all and am frankly surprised by all the great reviews I read before purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap, flimsy and foggy</li>
    <li> This works great! Unlike other &amp;#34;no fog&amp;#34; mirrors (which I have tried plenty) this is not just a flimsy reflective piece of plastic. It is sturdy and works well. I received this from my kids for Christmas and I&#x27;m loving it. I have a beard that grows quick enough to make Paul Bunyun jealous and it requires constant grooming. This mirror is great!</li>
    <li> My old shower mirror got kinda grimy over the years, so I threw it out and ordered this one.  I really wish I&#x27;d kept the old grimy one. At least it worked. This trash fogs up constantly when I try to use it for shaving. Don&#x27;t even think about breathing within a distance close enough to see your face in the mirror, or your breath will instantly make the entire mirror completely clouded.  I now have to wipe the mirror off with my hand or water in between every other razor pass while I&#x27;m shaving.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to matter how long or how many times I run it under the shower water to warm it up. It still fogs.</li>
    <li> Fog free works fine, but the water spots make it difficult to see, if you try to remove water from product,  then it steams up, and you have to \\&quot;warm up\\&quot; again, and now u have water on it again</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband to use in the shower.  His old one was bigger than this one overall, but most of it was a black frame around a tiny mirror.  So, this one is actually a bigger mirror.  Works great and does not fog.</li>
    <li> Get one for every shower and one to take with. best in-shower shaving mirror ever!</li>
    <li> This company is one of the best marketers I&#x27;ve ever seen.  They promote the product with expertise and irresistable persistence.  If you could get them to market your product, it would be a home run.  As to the mirror itself, yes, it will be fogless, but every so often if you take a while to shave as I do, you need to renew the temperature matching.  That is, hold it under the shower for a couple of seconds, again.  Othterwise, perfect.</li>
    <li> A lot of benefit for really short money. This mirror can be mounted, hand held or propped up for use. Run some shower water on it and it truly will not fog up for the time you are shaving. The reflection is sharp as well. Any bad reviews about this have been people complaining about the size and being surprised at its dimensions. This criticism is unfair because the dimensions are stated clearly - it&#x27;s handheld size. Also, not sure why you would want a large mirror for shaving in the shower. If you can see all of your face in it - that should be sufficient.</li>
    <li> I like this mirror because it is light-weight which allows the adhesive to stick easily to our wall tile.  In the past suction-cup mirrors have not stuck to our wall.  The fog issued is easily remedied by running warm water over the mirror.  My husband shaves easily.  Great price and works perfectly!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using cheap wally world mirror to shave in the shower for years. They fall, they break, they scratch easy, they build up crud in between the mirror and housing and they are a tad too big.    I saw this mirror, with hook and a hole and snapped up two right away. It&#x27;s a little smaller than I expected, but it&#x27;s not too small. It does the job, the hole provides enough grip while shaving and the hook lets me hang it out of the way. Love it.</li>
    <li> This mirror is perfect.  Easy to install (you stick the hook to the shower wall); easy to \\&quot;prime\\&quot; (just warm it in the shower jet for a few seconds); and a great price to boot.  &#x27;nough said.</li>
    <li> I browsed a lot of fog-free mirrors, and chose this one for its simplicity. You just warm the mirror in the shower water and it stays perfectly fog free. The mirror is small, but plenty big enough for the job, and it&#x27;s dead simple and works every time. Recommended.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and a must-have for anyone who shaves in the shower. For years I have dealt with mirrors in the shower that are complete crap. No more thanks to this shower mirror.  Here is what I love about this shower mirror:  1) It is small but big enough to see my face clearly.   2) It can be put anywhere in your shower with the little adhesive hook that comes with it.  3) No more mirror falling down from suction cups that don&#x27;t work thanks to #2.  4) It stays fog-free for most of my shower. All you have to do is hold the mirror under the shower stream for a few seconds. Since I also shave my head in the shower, I sometimes have to do this twice. But it is well-worth it.  5) Thanks to point #1 and #2, I can take the shower with me when I travel. This alone is worth the &#x27;price of admission&#x27;. (thinking about getting another adhesive hook for my next trip. Although, the hotel might not like this idea)  6) The mirror is unbreakable.  7) The mirror is perfect for shaving. It is not magnified and instead is very clear. (still don&#x27;t understand who actually shaves at a magnified levels.)  So, get this product...going to order another one shortly for my upstairs bathroom!!</li>
    <li> This is a phenomenal product - works great, doesn&#x27;t fog, simple and perfect.  A couple weeks after buying, I got a follow-up email from the company ensuring I was happy and offering their help if there were any issues.  What great service!</li>
    <li> This product is a great gadget for the shower at the price point. I was initially having some difficulty with the fog and the clip not staying adhered to the shower wall. I emailed the company and INSTANTLY was helped. They have AMAZING customer service and within days I got 2 new hooks and a huge email explaining how to effectively utilize the fog-free mirror. Great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> I recently started shaving in the shower and decided to invest in a fog-free mirror.  I wasn&#x27;t looking to spend a lot of money and I didn&#x27;t want anything cumbersome.  This mirror fit that description perfectly and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it thus far.</li>
    <li> You couldn&#x27;t ask for much more. It really is fog-free as advertised, comes with a hook for the shower wall (which has stayed attached for the month I&#x27;ve owned it), it&#x27;s light, and it&#x27;s plastic so I don&#x27;t mind throwing it in my suitcase when I travel.</li>
    <li> this product works exactly as advertised. even though I take a pretty long time to shave, I only have to rinse it 1 time extra in order to last the whole shower. it is NOT too small to some people have claimed. In fact, it&#x27;s the same size as the store-bought mirror I had previously. HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED!</li>
    <li> This is how it works for me:  1. Initially the mirror fogs up,   2. then one warms up the mirror with water, and   3. the mirror stays fog-free for about 10 minutes until it has cooled down enough,   4. when the procedure starts all over again.  So, the mirror works somewhat, but when I read \\&quot;TRULY FOG FREE\\&quot;, then I expect a mirror that never fogs up. It comes down to a \\&quot;SOMEWHAT FOG FREE\\&quot; mirror. The description explains the simple thermodynamic physic law this mirror is benefiting from, so there is really nothing particular novel about this mirror. But that is actually the good about this mirror: a simple, handy, and lasting design that works.  4 stars for a simple and functional mirror and good customer support. 5 if it were not \\&quot;over-advertised\\&quot; and the word \\&quot;truly\\&quot; were removed.</li>
    <li> Great shaving mirror but small for using in the shower. Could be 50% bigger  The fog free feature works well!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve shaved in the shower for about two decades, and have gone through countless mirrors.  The only one&#x27;s I have not tried are the direct-attach water mirrors, but those are basically high priced gimmicks that take the place of an easily removable mirror such as this.    I must say, I&#x27;ve gone thru about 15 or so mirrors in my shower-shaving life, and each one was pretty much a \\&quot;stick-on and leave\\&quot;; that is, once they are attached to your shower wall, it is either impossible to remove in some cases, or difficult to reattach in others (suction cup type, where the suction cup needs the wall to be clean and DRY to re-attach).  In all these cases, cleaning had to be remembered, not something done in the shower WHILE you are showering, which is when most of us actually remember to clean our shower mirrors.  This mirror though, seems to be different.  First off, it does not attach to your shower wall via sticky strip or suction cup...it hangs from the included sticky-strip hook.  This is better off than all the others in ease of cleaning as well as ease of use.  2nd, by removing it from the hang hook, you can use it for normally hard to view areas of your face that you used to twist and turn to see.  Nice.  My only complaint, which is the only reason I awarded it 4 out of 5 stars, is it&#x27;s size.  It is about 4x6.  They claim this is helpful in holding it in your hand while shaving, but honestly a 8x11 size is just as easy.  It&#x27;s not like these things are heavy; they weigh a couple ounces.  Making it bigger won&#x27;t add but a couple more ounces, and my razor weighs more than that.  This would eliminate the need to remove it to see all your face; as it is, you can only see about 3/4 of your face, and I like to see all of it.    Regardless of that single flaw, I believe it is better than every mirror I have used so far.</li>
    <li> This is an update to my previous review below...  After writing this review I was contacted by a Shave Well company representative who wanted to see if they could do anything to fix the problem.  After talking to them on the phone, I realized I was trying the remove the protective coating on the wrong side of the mirror.  In my defense, it is very confusing and the rep said they have had this feedback before and had already made changes to the labeling (I had one of the older mirrors).  He offered to send me a new mirror with updated instructions since I had scratched up the original mirror.  Within a week, I had a new mirror and my husband loves it.  Yes, it&#x27;s a very simple product, nothing fancy, but it works.  And for $10 it&#x27;s a great buy.  I was very impressed with the customer service and would recommend them fully.  ----------------  I was very excited to buy this mirror for my husband after reading such great reviews.  It seemed to fit all my needs...simple, durable, priced well.    I received the item and my husband was eager to try it out right away.  The first thing we need to do is \\&quot;Remove Protective Coating\\&quot;.  Sounds simple enough.  2 hours later, after breaking 2 nails and my husband resorting to using a sharp paring knife the protective coating is still fully entact.  I have no idea what this protective coating is made from but it is impossible to get off!  I&#x27;ve read other reviews with the same problem but eventually they managed to get the coating off.  What am I doing wrong?  Or did I get the one mirror where physical vapor deposition was used to apply the coating?  In any case, I&#x27;ll be returning this product, very disappointed.</li>
    <li> The mirror is about the size of a paperback book, so it is somewhat small.  BUT it works very very well so I would highly recommend this!  Super lightweight so would be good for travel as well.  My Hubby is happy with it.</li>
    <li> Works as described!&lt;br /&gt;Use it daily in the shower!&lt;br /&gt;The only way to shave.&lt;br /&gt;Try tea tree oil instead of shave cream. Works fantastic!</li>
    <li> On the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really is a great product--when you run the mirror under hot water and hang it, it really does stay fogless so long as you keep the hot water running. However, be aware that if you travel, this is not the model you want. The adhesive hook is definitely not suited for temporary applications. You want http://www.amazon.com/The-Shave-Well-Company-Travel/dp/B0083VCV1O/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_hg_6&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On customer service:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The customer service for the company is excellent. Within a few days of receiving this product, I received an email offering assistance and answers to any questions I had. I told this representative that I was dissatisfied with my purchase because I had read that this product was &amp;#34;good for travel&amp;#34; and did not realize the nature of the adhesive hook. They sent me a suction cup for free. Awesome customer service right there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5 for the product doing its job and the great customer service behind it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year now, must say great investment. Does works as advertised, I like to shave in the shower sometimes and very cheap price this does its job. When I run the mirror under the water front and back then it doesn&#x27;t fog up.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions to the letter (the ones included with the produce and the ones emailed to me by the seller), but their fog free solution did not work for me.  The say all you need to do is hold the mirror in the shower stream to equalize the temperature of the mirror with the air temperature in the shower.  When I did this, I ended up with a mirror covered with water droplets (too many to see through) that fogged back up in about one minute.  My solution was to spray the mirror with some shower cleaner (Clorox Clean-up) just before I wanted to use it.  This resulted in a droplet free, fog free mirror.  The other problem I&#x27;ve had is with the mirror staying attached to the wall.  The mirror itself has a hole in the top that hooks onto a plastic hook that attached to the wall of the shower with self-adhesive tape.  Again, I followed the product&#x27;s (and seller&#x27;s) instructions exactly when attaching the hook and the mirror seems to weigh practically nothing.  BUT, the hook (and mirror) fell to the floor of the shower after just two weeks.  So, to summarize, to make the mirror fog free, spray it with something like Clorox Clean-up before every use and don&#x27;t leave the mirror hanging on the hook unless you are using the mirror.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband. He is happy with it. I wouldnt say this is truly fog free though. But works well.</li>
    <li> I would buy &amp;#34;fog free&amp;#34;, or maybe even &amp;#34;truly fog free&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;FOG FREE&amp;#34;, but &amp;#34;TRULY FOG FREE&amp;#34; it is not.  It&#x27;s pretty good, but will fog up over time as I&#x27;m guessing anything will.  Better than an average mirror though.</li>
    <li> This is a good product and for the price, just about everything I could ask for. If you follow the instructions, you should have no major problems shaving in the shower. Plan ahead where you place the hook, think about how it will hang and you want the mirror to be a little below the center of your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sticky pad came off after a couple months, but they are easily replaceable.</li>
    <li> wow is all. this is one bad ass product, made my morning shaving delightful. didn&#x27;t fog at all, easy installation.</li>
    <li> After putting it under warm water it is fog free, only for a couple of minutes. But who really needs more than that to shave?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the design of this mirror could be a little better. After putting the mirror back on the hook after heating it up, there are always a couple of water droplets that slide down the middle of the mirror. However after experimenting I noticed that after heating it up and then putting it sideways (or in a landscape orientation) there aren&#x27;t any droplets of water going down the mirror.  Just something to think about</li>
    <li> Wonderfully simple, installs in seconds.  This shower mirror is the simplest and perhaps the best yet.  I&#x27;ve had several: from one that connects to the shower head to run warm water through it to this simple but highly effective mirror.  Plus this one is portable.  I can throw it in a bag and use it at hotels and resorts.  Inexpensive, simple, and effective. This is my second mirror that I keep in my travel kit.  First mirror is in new condition after using 2 years.  Great product.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo230C152N71016]]Here&#x27;s the condition of the mirror after a few months of gentle use.  Unfortunately it&#x27;s just not made to last.    EDIT:  See comments.  The new product has worked great and did not suffer any of the original problems.  Has lasted for over a year now.  Combine with the fantastic service I&#x27;ve raised my review to 4 stars.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best shower mirror solution I have used. I tried product from ToiletTree, but it is bulky and plasticky. This mirror is simple and sophisticated at the same time. best of all, it works exactly as advertised. Pair it with chrome hook by Hansgrohe also available on Amazon for $14 and you have a solution that works and looks like thousand bucks. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Pretty basic, but that&#x27;s the point. Fogless-ness requires wiping with water. That could be better.</li>
    <li> Thought this product was really anti fog, but it is not. I love how light weight it is and the hook that it brings, but hate how small and how foggy it gets. Fell very short of expectations.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week now and it does exactly what the manufacturer says. I have not had a problem since it first arrived last week and I&#x27;m looking forward to using this for a very long time. At first I thought the size may be a bit too small, but it turned out to be perfect.</li>
    <li> This is my second shower mirror.  The first was a poor at best and fell to it&#x27;s death a few months ago. This one is terrific, simple, and works as advertised.  It does tend to fog up after a few minutes (I shave my face and head) but only takes a few seconds under the shower to continue back to fog free.</li>
    <li> This product worked great for me. Much better than old shaving mirror that I had that often fell off the wall and fogged up. Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Performs as advertised - NO FOG.  I followed the simple instructions and am very satisfied.  I do take the added step of drying the mirror after my shower due to minerals in my well water that could possibly dry on the mirror.</li>
    <li> PRO:&lt;br /&gt;This mirror&#x27;s hook stays on the wall.&lt;br /&gt;It does not fog up if warmed in the shower water.&lt;br /&gt;It is not too small, just the right size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON:&lt;br /&gt;BUT I don&#x27;t use it. Before you buy this you should consider whether your shower is well lit enough for it to be of use, although it does not fog, it will be covered with water drops and if you get up close to it, your breath will temporarily fog it. When combined with poor lighting, it doesn&#x27;t really give that good a view of your shave. Also, while you stand there in the shower shaving for several minutes, you will want the water to be on so you won&#x27;t freeze to death. I decided to do my shaving at the bathroom mirror, after my shower, to save water and my eyesight.</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with the product and personal service. I would recommend this to anyone reading these reviews and would consider purchasing another one in the future, should the need ever arise.</li>
    <li> Mirror is pretty good but to use it with fog free you have to warm it up in the shower for a couple seconds.  KInd of misleading advertising but if you follow instructions it does what it says it does.  Does not feel like its worth 10 dollars. Maybe 3</li>
    <li> Not the best fog free mirror I&#x27;ve ever used. It fogs up pretty hard and the only way to clear is to hold under the shower every 30 seconds or so. It also spots really bad but some Rain X may cure that issue.</li>
    <li> They excel in customer support but the hook broke after a short while. Easy fix. Still great.</li>
    <li> Works great.  I use it to shave in the shower at the gym almost every day. I use mine with a suction cup hook for portability.  It&#x27;s so light there is no strain on the hook at all.  A nice adhesive hook is included as well.  Mirror does not fog and provides a good clear image.  Very lightweight, great for travel, camping, etc.  Am ordering another to keep in my home shower and a few more as gifts.  Great product and a great family owned company.  Interested buyers should read the company&#x27;s biography, a real homegrown success story.  Plus made in the USA and backed by people that clearly care about their products and their customers.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This mirror has worked perfectly for my son. He moved and contacted the company for advice for a replacement adhesive, they simply sent him a new adhesive and hook for free! Well worth the purchase, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> Works like it is supposed to, its not very big but it works. I have already dropped it a few times and it&#x27;s claim of being shatterproof seems true.</li>
    <li> Much smaller than expected and nothing more than a piece of mirrored plastic.  Don&#x27;t expect anything fancy with this item.  So far it does stay pretty clear in the shower - although it does depend on how well your shower holds warm air...  any type of cool draft will cause the mirror to slightly fog even with following the plain directions.  Over priced for what you get.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the performance of this mirror.  I am giving it 4/5 stars only because I feel like it is too costly for a shower mirror.</li>
    <li> I have had this for over 3 years now and is still great.  The hook is still attached to the fiberglass shower with no problem and the mirror is working great.  I have very hard water so the only thing I have to do is to clean it with windex about once a month.  Great product!!  Now over 4 years.  Still great, starting to &amp;#34;silver&amp;#34; a little on the bottom edge.  Still amazed the hook has no issue staying attached</li>
    <li> It was ok but it looks far away and my husband needs it to be a close up mirror..oh well we kept it</li>
    <li> I must have tried every reputedly fog-free shower mirror available for the past twenty years.  They&#x27;ve ALWAYS disappointed, each remaining fog-free for a time, none staying fog-free permanently.  This mirror is doing an excellent job so far when used, carefully, according to the mfgr&#x27;s instructions.  Fingers crossed I&#x27;ll be able to say this a year from now.</li>
    <li> As long as you are happy with the dimensions of this mirror you will be pleased with this product.  I thought it was a bit small but my husband is a big guy and he says it&#x27;s perfect.  It is a great no fog mirror and does what it says - no breaking, no fog.  We have broke countless shower mirrors and I was skeptical about the clarity of a non-glass mirror but this one is great.  For a man that really prefers to shave in the shower this is a must have!</li>
    <li> I purchased this thing over 3 years ago and I still use it to shave in the shower to this day, great bang for the buck!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. After reading the reviews I knew that you had to be very specific when you used this product the very first time. We followed the instructions to a &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; and it still gets extremely fogged up. I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror with a fear that it wouldn&#x27;t work from all the negative reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. The mirror will fog up in the shower, but a quick rinse under the warm water and it is clear again for a good minute or more. Glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> I bough this mirror three years ago.  At that time, I wrote the following review.  My opinion has not changed. &amp;#34;I have tried many different shower mirrors.  This one works exactly as advertised.  It&#x27;s a great Price.  If you continue searching for a different mirror, you are wasting your time. What else is there to say?&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> The coating came off after a few short months.  Surprised no one else has this problem unless it has something to do with how I clean my shower.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this mirror for almost a year and love it. It truly is fog free. It&#x27;s design is simple, and there are fancier fog free mirrors on the market, however this one does what it says and is cheap. It also is extremely durable. I&#x27;ve dropped it many times and still looks new.</li>
    <li> Have had a few other \\&quot; fogless\\&quot; mirrors in the shower before, and never worked.  This one actually did, I am happilly impressed.</li>
    <li> I have been using this fog free shower shave mirror for about a week and it works just as advertised.  If you hold the mirror under warm shower water for fifteen or twenty seconds on both sides, the mirror remains fog free for the duration of the shower.  I am writing this review for another reason.  The device comes with a protective film over the mirror which is almost impossible to remove.  It is clearly a design flaw and a mistake.  I patiently took a quarter and rubbed it over the top of the mirror to remove the protective film and only after much patience did I finally get a sliver of opening to remove the film, which then came off quite easily.  The makers of this mirror should include a tab at the top of the mirror to remove the protective film.  Those who buy this mirror, don&#x27;t despair, the film fill come off with some patience on your part.</li>
    <li> I followed all the directions and all the tips, it works just OK. Its not fog proof, but it does resist fog better than a regular mirror.&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;m shaving, I&#x27;ll have to pick it up, let it run under the water to clear off the fog every 2 or 3 minutes. It gets the job done, but its not some miracle product.</li>
    <li> This is NOT a fog free mirror. You have to soak this mirror in water for it to resist fog... And even then it&#x27;s not 100%. But once you soak Irvin water, you have standing water all over the mirror. Nothing fancy. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> This mirror is almost too small to be of any use.  I do like that it is acrylic and there&#x27;s no threat of broken glass in the shower.  I do not see that it is any more &amp;#34;fog free&amp;#34; than other mirrors.</li>
    <li> Our water is terrible... For a super basic mirror it goes a good job and not affected by the hard water to much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d say my one major complaint about this mirror is that it could be bigger.  Its only 6&amp;#34; x 4&amp;#34;.  Definitely go for the larger size instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror works well--it&#x27;s nothing special though.  It&#x27;s just a mirror that hangs on a hook you stick to the wall.  When the mirror starts to fog up you just take it off the hook, run it under the hot shower water until it defogs, and then hang it back up.  Typically, the mirror stays fog-free for about 1-2 minutes.  I generally have to run it under the water at least once in order to finish my shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a bad deal for $10 though.  I use it regularly and I&#x27;m overall very satisfied.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Its cheap and its truly NOTbfog free but it does the job.  The sticky back fell off after 6 months and I did clean the surface first.  My wife just stuck it back up with some different tape.</li>
    <li> Needed this in my shower and if you follow the directions it works as described. If you need a shaving mirror you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
    <li> I was worried....would this be another waste of money?  No.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many fog-free mirrors over the past 20+ years and they are too big, don&#x27;t really stay fog free, and didn&#x27;t really fit well in the shower.  This is basically an acrylic mirror, light weight, small in size and nothing fancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t plan on using the hook as I don&#x27;t want to put the adhesive on the shower tile.  I have a window ledge to prop it up against.  Otherwise I would use a suction cup hook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you are ready to shave, hold it under the hot water, place it where you want, and shave.  There will be droplets of water but it isn&#x27;t distracting and mine stayed fog free longer than the entire shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought two.  One at home and one to keep in my toiletry case for travel.</li>
    <li> My husband is a minimalist and very particular about any item that comes into our home. He asked for a shower mirror to shave and I knew I had a task to pick the perfect one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He LOVES this mirror. It is not too big and hangs easily on the side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The anti-fogging feature impressed him a great deal.</li>
    <li> Took gthe mirror with me on a cruise and used it successfully. I got a clear impression of my face without the annoyance of fog or mist. A wonderful invention.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re like me, you hate shaving.  I would grow Odin&#x27;s beard if it didn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;d be ostrasized by my contemporaries.  Beards are pretty cool - not the ones that are well-groomed (sorry Al Borland), but the grizzled ones.  Those dudes with those beards are neat.  Except for that one guy.  Nobody likes that guy with or without the sweet beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I hate shaving, mostly because it feels like another chore to tack on to my hellish day. However, this fog-free mirror turns a chore into a easy routine.  Shaving has become part of shower-time.  I like showers and being clean, so incorporating shaving with this mirror just feels right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Run warm to hot water on both sides of the mirror to prevent fogging, just like everybody says.  It works because of science.</li>
    <li> This mirror does fog up every now and then due to a cold draft coming in the shower, however the fog disappears as soon as run the mirror under water for a few seconds.  I&#x27;m not a klutz but I do feel some comfort in knowing that I could drop this mirror and not have it break.  It&#x27;s perfect for travel too.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get the Command Hooks that Amazon recommends with it.  This mirror comes with its own hook and it works just fine.</li>
    <li> I was tired of having to wipe the bathroom mirror to remove steam while shaving.. This mirror worked as advertized, Smaller than i expected.</li>
    <li> The design of this mirror is so simple, it makes you wonder why someone didn&#x27;t think of it sooner.  The material cost is pretty cheap, but I&#x27;d gladly pay the $9.99 I paid just for the flexibility of having it be truly fog free and for being able to use it as a handheld shower mirror.  It is smaller than other shower mirrors I have had, but just right for my spouse to shave his face, and why have to clean a larger surface than you need.  Speaking of cleaning, I just use toothpaste in round circles when it gets spots and becomes clear again with no scratches.  We have had it 10 months now and it still looks great.  It has been dropped a few times and hasn&#x27;t broken, then again, it is just a thin, cheap piece of plastic, so it isn&#x27;t that delicate.  ***Update. It has now been 4 Years! since I purchased this, and it still works well, isn&#x27;t water-logged, stays clean when I rub it with toothpaste, and is clear and fog-free.</li>
    <li> it is simple and effective. You can easily remove from the wall to wash with warm water of the shower helping to prevent the fog. So far also durable and well constructed. Liked a lot and I will buy another one to keep a spare!</li>
    <li> The mirror itself is great, it saves me a good 2-3 minutes every morning not having to re-wet my face and clean up a splashy mess around the sink after shaving. When I moved apartments a week after getting it, I sent an email asking if I could buy just a new hook as the one supplied was very adhesive, they overnighted me a new hook for free, and got a followup email to make sure I got it, this company is really making it a point to make sure every customer is happy.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this!  He says it works great.  It is pretty small but seems to do the trick for shaving in the shower.</li>
    <li> Cheap product and unfortunately I got what I paid for. I did exactly as instructed with the instructions provided in the box but this mirror fogs up immediately regardless.</li>
    <li> It is all that it says it is. Easy to hang up and take with you on trips and Truly fog free . I will buy from this supplier again.</li>
    <li> Mirror is not completely fog free.  It actually fogs up every few minutes.  But all you have to do is run it under the water for a second and the fog goes away.  I use this mirror to be able to see my hair when I washing/styling in the shower.  It&#x27;s fine for my use, but if you want a mirror that is really fog free, opt for a different choice.  I&#x27;ve read some reviews about the mirror falling and breaking.  Mines seems to be holding up very well so far.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my husband and he love it. He said that it really doesn&#x27;t fog</li>
    <li> This mirror works great if you read the instructions! I don&#x27;t understand how you couldn&#x27;t, yet still many 1-2 star reviews. The box, the insert, the instructions and ALL over these Amazon reviews....RUN IT UNDER THE WATER TO MAKE THE MIRROR THE SAME TEMP AS THE SHOWER!!&lt;br /&gt;Goodness sake, condensation is not some magical work of the devil, it&#x27;s when WARM HUMID air collects on a COLD surface. Bring the cold surface up to the same temperature and TA DA no condensation. There is no special coating, no magic, nothing.&lt;br /&gt;So what makes this little guy special?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Size. Not to big not to small. Light enough to hang from a hook without coming off the wall. Pack in a travel bag. Take camping. Etc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Its plastic and light. The worry of glass in the shower is eliminated and with the added rounded corners, I don&#x27;t think it would be a big deal if you dropped it. I don&#x27;t know because I never have. I hold it in my wet hand all the time to get the right angle or better light (another plus for is smaller size!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Price. Around $10 &amp; The Shave Well Company has very good customer service based on what I&#x27;ve seen in reviews and comment responses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip that really makes this mirror work is after you rinse/heat it up &#x27;squeegee&#x27; it with the edge of some bar soap one time, this will put a thin layer of soap you can see through but will prevent water from beading up on it...</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. He never uses it. He said it fogs up.</li>
    <li> First, the product works, period!  I have tried many other mirrors only to be disappointed.  This product will not leave you disappointed!  Second, customer service is AMAZING! I received an email from the company thanking me for my purchase, encouraging me to contact them if I have any questions, and asking how I liked the product.  I wish the rest of corporate America would take lessons from them.    Buy this product! You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This mirror is NOT fog free for those of you who are interested in a product like this. Its a great value and I still use it but buyer beware, it will fog up frequently. It would be better to call it fog resistant probably.</li>
    <li> Just got mine and used it twice - very reasonably priced, works as advertised, is VERY light so secures to shower wall easily.  I&#x27;ve shaved in the shower for 20+ years and used many mirrors - this is the best.  YOu can make it perform even better using a little trick i learned that makes most mirrors fogfree ... just wipe some shampoo lather on the mirror and let it run off while you are showering - by the time you are ready to shave the soap will have mostly all run off and left behind a clear mirror - may have somethign to do it a thin soap film preventing fog from forming ... anyway it always works for me.  And no need to hold the mirror under the water.  The key for me is that this mirror is so light - most mirror eventually fall and break.  Enjoy.</li>
    <li> this mirror is great run it under the warm shower water for a second and it&#x27;s fogless again. best shower mirror i ever had. and you cant beat the price nothing beats a shaving in the shower! the only con i have with this is its size ita a little on the small side but its still a great mirror</li>
    <li> The first hook failed the day after I install it.  After reading the first review I wrote, the company sent me a replacement hook which is working as advertised.  A few second under the hot water and the mirror doesn&#x27;t fog and it presents a clear image.  I am happy with the product and delighted with the level of customer service. I wish all companies did customer service as well as this one.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a few fogless mirrors and spent at least $100 on them total. Some work for a bit, some never worked, and some were just a hassle. I thought I would try this one and I&#x27;m pleased with it. First off, it IS fogless. FOLLOW THE SIMPLE DIRECTIONS and it will be for you too. I like that it&#x27;s acrylic, that&#x27;s a huge safety feature. It doesn&#x27;t have any noticeable distortion. Water beads up very small when using it and is not obtrusive. It&#x27;s easy to clean and easy to hold. The size is fine and fits well in the hand and reflects plenty of area. My bathroom is poorly lit with a weak fluorescent fixture so the fact it has a quality mirror surface is greatly appreciated.  Get one. The price is right, it works if you can read, and it can be useful in many ways besides shower shaving.</li>
    <li> This thing actually does what it is advertised to do. When I first peeled off the protective covering, I was amazed at the clarity this mirror has! While in the shower, the mirror stays fog free with a simple rinse under the hot water. The water beads up well providing a very clear view. Only thing, be certain where you want it, because the stick up tape provided really sticks. I can&#x27;t comment about the longevity of the tape/hook yet as I&#x27;ve only had it up for one day so far. Also, the mirror size is adequate, but having it a little larger would be nice. Makes shaving a lot less miserable when done in a nice hot shower! Well worth the price!</li>
    <li> Purchased the mirror, didn&#x27;t know how to keep it fog-free in my chronically cold bathroom.  I was contacted by the seller who sent personalized instructions and another hanging hook for lower in my shower stall.  I received incredible personalized and attentive service.  The mirror works well for my needs and to trim my mustache edges.  High recommendations for the product and the service.</li>
    <li> Has never fallen off the wall and is so simple to use! I will NEVER go back to traditional shaving. Thank you Shave Well Company!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: The hook fell off the wall, but I called the shave well company and they sent me a new one for free! Great product and great company!</li>
    <li> The mirror is made of plastic, feels cheaply made. The mirror will stay fog free for a couple minutes after running it in hot water but will fog up again. I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s worth $10.</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected however it works great for the money.  I use it at home so if it was bigger i would have been more pleased. They should make two sizes.</li>
    <li> Of all the shower mirror&#x27;s I have purchased, this one is the best and the price is right.  It still fogs but not as bad as the others.</li>
    <li> My first mirror had some minor problems with the reflective coating on the back chipping around the edges.  I didn&#x27;t ask for anything but simply left a review indicating the minor problem; the mirror was still just as effective.  Apparently there was an issue with this one particular production run.  I am sincerely impressed by the immediate follow up that I received from the vendor.  They wanted to know what was wrong, sent me a new mirror at no cost and only wanted the other one back for quality control testing.  They followed up with me every step of the way to insure my satisfaction.  Needless to say I have been very impressed by the company&#x27;s willingness to stand behind their product, the excellent and timely communication and their desire to make me happy as a customer no matter what it takes.  I would recommend this product and will always recommend this company to do business with.  Thanks Bill for your excellent customer service and dedication to your product and company.</li>
    <li> While I have purchased dozens of products through Amazon, this mirror has compelled me to write my first product review.  In my experience it is a very poor product.  I have been shaving in the shower for over thirty years and have always used a small glass make-up type mirror.  A regular mirror would last me years before the coating would finally wear down enough to partially block the reflection.  Based on the positive reviews here, I decided to give the Shave Well Fog Free Mirror a try.  My first impression was that the mirror is nothing more than a cheap piece of coated Plexiglas, not much bigger than an I-phone.  But, again based on the reviews, I decided to withhold judgment until I actually used the mirror for a while.  The hanging hook went on well, and the mirror was ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;  Using the mirror as instructed, it seemed to work moderately well although the water droplets left on the mirror after running it under the shower seemed to distort the reflection more than on a glass mirror I was used to using.  While not completely happy with the operation of the mirror,  I nonetheless decided to continue using it as I had already paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;After just a couple of weeks, I noticed that the gray \\&quot;paint\\&quot; on the reverse side of the mirror had started flaking off.  While at first  it didn&#x27;t seem to affect the mirror coating, it was still disturbing to me.  Then, a short time later, the actual mirror coating began to flake off.  It is not a huge area yet but I suspect it will just continue to get worse.&lt;br /&gt;  Pretty poor workmanship considering the relatively high cost of this product.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I received one from a \\&quot;bad batch\\&quot; as reported by an earlier reviewer.  If that is the case, I will hope to hear from the manufacturer about a replacement.</li>
    <li> After trying many different, and all more expensive mirrors claiming to be fog free, this little mirror is my favorite.  Easy to handle, and stays clear for an entire shave.  And the hook actually stays on the tile!  All for under $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have gone through a few of the shower mirrors over the years. This is the best I have found. Had a friend to tell me about them and had to try it for the price... BEST I have ever had!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kirt</li>
    <li> I used to shave in the shower by using a typical handheld mirror flipped upside down and placed carefully on a wall mounted razor holder.  This meant I had to constantly worry about the suction cup failing, thus sending the glass mirror to its untimely death and shattering all over the place.  I like the fact that this one won&#x27;t shatter or break, because I always had a fear of seeing the mirror fall, trying to catch it, and slashing myself with the razor as I make the split second action.    As far as the anti-fogging capability, it seems to work pretty well.  I take fairly hot showers and would venture to guess the initial heat up lasts for 80% of my shave.  I hold it under the hot water for about 20-30 seconds total, flipping it over every few seconds.  From there, as I see it start to fog slightly I&#x27;ll just get a mouthful of water as I&#x27;m rinsing my face and splash it on the mirror again.  Not much trouble at all to do so and it seems to help it keep up its temperature.    With all that said, mine appears to have some sort of defect where it looks like the backing is flaking off around the edges.  I can&#x27;t tell what&#x27;s going on because nothing on the front or back is damaged, it&#x27;s almost like it&#x27;s happening from within the mirror.  You can see what I mean by checking this picture out:    [...]    That&#x27;s happening all over the bottom and around the mounting hole as well.  It doesn&#x27;t affect me when I shave, it&#x27;s just annoying to see and appears to be getting slowly worse.  As such, I give it a 4/5.</li>
    <li> This mirror does exactly what the name says it will do.  I have gone through many cheap \\&quot;fog free\\&quot; mirrors that are unusable after a few weeks.  I am rarely inspired to write product reviews but I wish I had come across this product sooner and saved some dough.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror.  It comes with a permanent mounting brakcet which I opted to replace with a sucker cup bracket I already had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is where my loyalty was won.  Not to mention the mirror is a perfect size (not to big, not to small), plastic so I don&#x27;t worry about if it breaks while I am in the shower, and works as advertised, I admire a company that reads its reviews.  When I first received this, I put up a comment that I didn&#x27;t like the permanent mount (who always wants a portable mirror in one location?).  Then, in the mail, without a request, I got a note with a sucker cup mount, explaining most customers prefer the permanent one so this is what they opted for in the packaging, but here was a sucker cup for my use.  Now THAT is customer service!</li>
    <li> Bought this in Sept 2012 - For the first month or so it worked great - however now I can barely see myself in it when trying to shave in the shower. Try another model!</li>
    <li> Works well, just a little small... but, pleased with it  I ecommend this product to others- a simple and effective design.  .</li>
    <li> Well, it works...&lt;br /&gt;It serves the purpose, but I had to hand hold it to be of much use due to the size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positive...&lt;br /&gt;It Works - meaning no fog. (especially if you heat it to shower temperature)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative...&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very small, basically a hand held mirror.  (Looked bigger online)</li>
    <li> I was surprised how small it was but what is strange that this mirror works like a reduction mirror, I see my face much smaller than any regular mirror.....which makes it difficult to use unless I stick my face against the mirror.  Fog Free only works when you pre-warmed the mirror and be sure that the mirror stays warm or it&#x27;ll get fogged up. Not convenience if you can image holding the mirror under warm water for a few minutes everytime in order to use.&lt;br /&gt;Came with a self adhesive hook, I believe it&#x27;s so that you can take it out easily to rinse warm and hang back, but the mirror is so small that it would works better as a travel size, but you can&#x27;t take the permanently adhered hook with you.  I think it should come with an additional sucking hook.</li>
    <li> Out of all the shower mirrors I&#x27;ve had in the past this one works the best. This is the second one I have purchased for use in my girlfriend&#x27;s shower. Quick and easy set up with sturdy adhesive. Even though the instructions say to run it under the water to make sure it doesn&#x27;t fog, but since I&#x27;m lazy I don&#x27;t and it still works great with no fogging. The only thing that could make it better would be a hook for the razor.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised, fantastic product. Only wish it would stay fog-free for a little longer.</li>
    <li> I was used to a more gimic-y shaving mirror.  This thing is dead simple.  Heat it up in the shower water, and you shave.  My old shaving mirrors had special coatings and such...  The only things I kind of miss is the little razor holder my old mirror had, and the out of the box ability to hang it from a suction cup.  So...  I found myself a plastic suction cup with a hook, and use it to hang the mirror from the glass shower door, rather than use the more permanent stick on hook that comes with it.</li>
    <li> It will fog up, in a very foggy shower. But hang it away from direct fog and it works okay.</li>
    <li> I purchased one a year or so ago. At first it was great, after a while the backing started to wear off. Now there are blank areas on the mirror. Yes, I did buy two more because when the mirror is new it works as it should. Just hold the mirror under the shower and let it warm up to water temperature and it should work fine until your shaved. If it fogs again, reinsert under the shower. My only complaint is the one previously mentioned. I feel if it lasts a year or two it will have served its purpose. Maybe the new ones will do better than the first, hope so.</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected. This product worked perfect and worth the money.</li>
    <li> Predict when I use in shower . Saves time thanks</li>
    <li> Love the customer support, the clear instructions, the fact that it&#x27;s removable, and the fact that it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with my purchase; but I find the mirror to be quite small, which is why I deducted one star.</li>
    <li> If you have ever NOT shaved because it is a pain to get out all your gear and clean up afterwards, you should be shaving in the shower. This product is all you need to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror is fog-free, as advertised, and is lightweight, so I&#x27;m not worried about dropping it on my foot or having it fall on someone taking a bath (wife or kid). The included hook attaches easily and has more than enough strength to hold it up. I even flip it up on the hook (mirror hole on bottom side) and lean it forward to get a downward angle on the mirror, which is nice. Best of all, the price is right, so you don&#x27;t have to invest an arm and a leg if shower shaving isn&#x27;t for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advice: Position the mirror at a comfortable height opposite of your shower head so that you avoid spraying water on the mirror while you are shaving. I placed mine a bit too close and have to wipe it off a couple times during shaving. With your back to the shower head, this probably wouldn&#x27;t be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As many others have mentioned, the company behind this product is very responsive and believe in their product. If you don&#x27;t like the product, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d be happy to refund or replace.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this thing actually working in the shower, but all you have to do is run it under the water for a few seconds and it&#x27;s good to go.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had lots of shaving mirrors for the shower.  This is the only one that works!!.  And was less expensive than any other!!!</li>
    <li> The mirror works as it says it does. The only thing i would do different is make it a bit bigger. There are suction ones that aren&#x27;t that well created but are large. If it this one was it would absolutely be 5star worthy.</li>
    <li> I had a problem with the hook included with this product, and the vice president of the company took notice that I was unsatisfied and personally rectified the matter at no cost to me. You won&#x27;t get this level of dedication from Wal-Mart! Thanks guys. Mirror works great now.</li>
    <li> This product works exactly how it says it will.  The grib does work well.  My husband loves it, and now he can shave in the shower instead of getting facial hair all in my sink and on my bathroom counter.  Thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Be sure to read all the instructions carefully before deciding on the place for the hook.  It must not be anywhere near the shower curtain or in the path of air that circulates around the curtain.  Also, be sure to follow the guidelines about how high the mirror must hang.</li>
    <li> Shaving in the shower definitely makes for a smoother and closer shave. The trade-off is that you may be wasting a fair amount of water while doing so. On the other hand, turning off the water flow while shaving can make for a rather cold experience and negate the comfort benefit of a smooth and close shave. By installing a shower fixture with separate temperature and volume controls I&#x27;ve been able to minimize that drawback, since I can reduce water flow to a minimum while maintaining the proper temperature. Having done so, I can speak to the effectiveness of this mirror in a guilt-free manner. If only solving other ecological trade-offs - like choosing between paper and plastic when you forget to bring your own shopping bag - was so easy...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;Safe in case you drop the it - Acrylic will not shatter, so no worries about a potential undesirable situation of glass shards on the shower floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hook adheres well - Should you need to remove it in the future, any minor adhesive residue appears to be easily cleaned off without harsh chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly fog-free - At least in my small shower stall, the air temperature stays warm enough for a fog-free experience once you have warmed the mirror as per the directions. Also, it is easy to re-warm the mirror if a cooler air-stream hits it while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer communication and service is superb; I received an informative email even before delivery of the mirror, and printed information accompanying the mirror is clear and well-designed. Unlike most companies, the ShaveWell Company really means it when they say that customer delight with their product is the most important thing. Take a look at what other reviewers have to say about their prompt and helpful responses to customer questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s (Minor):&lt;br /&gt;The mirror is fairly small - Depending on how your shower/bath stall configuration impacts where you hang it (and your eyesight), you might need to stand out ofthe shower flow in order to use it while it is hanging. If so, that can make for a chilly experience. My preference is to hang it far enough from the main water flow to minimize soapy spray that would lead to residue build-up, and in my small shower stall I can do so yet remain in a warm water flow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water remains beaded up on the mirror after warming it - Shaving visibilty remains OK, but it would be nice if the mirror was coated with a product that enables water to run-off such as those used on auto windshields and glass shower/bath doors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easily scratchable - Acrylic is clearly the safe choice for an in-shower mirror, but you need to exercise care when cleaning it. Should some soap scum eventually build up, be sure to use the proper cleaning agent and a soft cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall Assessment:&lt;br /&gt;An inexpensive product that does what it promises from a company that truly cares about its customers. Big quality of life boost if you can minimize water waste / guilt. I would give it 5 stars if it came in a slightly larger size with a coating that enables water beads to run off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: SIMPLE TOOTHPASTE METHOD FOR REDUCING WATER BEADING - I tried the toothpaste suggestion for treating the mirror emailed to me from the Shave Well Company immediately after posting my review (and originally suggested by another reviewer) and found that it works quite well for minimizing water beading on the mirror during use. Simply wet the mirror, gently rub it with a pea-sized bit of toothpaste, rinse off, and repeat as needed. An additional benefit is that it delays soap scum build-up. I would suggest using a plain, inexpensive toothpaste instead of the fancy \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; toothpastes, which often contain fine polishing granules that might scratch the acrylic mirror.</li>
    <li> This little mirror is excellent.  It&#x27;s built tough and the mirror is well protected from the elements it will encounter in the shower.  It is simple, which is perfect because you don&#x27;t want any nooks or crannies to trap water.  It has a large hole at the top that enables you to hang it anywhere you want, and it comes with a stick on plastic hook.  So far I am very pleased with this mirror.  It&#x27;s a really great design.</li>
    <li> This product isn&#x27;t terrible. It doesn&#x27;t fall off the wall, but it also does not stay fog free. I followed all the instructions to the letter and yet each shower it gets all fogged up. If I want to see my ugly face I actually have to take it off the hook and run water on both sides of it and then wipe the water off the mirror side with my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there you go, save your $10.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be like a real cool mirror with a frame and stuff, but it&#x27;s just like the box shows, a little mirror with a hole in it, and one of those tape hooks that you can get to hang pictures and stuff. It does stay pretty fog free if you run it under water, but then it is all covered in water so it&#x27;s just as hard to see out of. feels like it should be a dollar or less.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to find that a got directions on how to make this mirror fog free.  I think you could take any mirror and warm it under the water to make it fog free.</li>
    <li> great portable mirror that doesn&#x27;t fog up whatsoever.  I stuff it in my shower bag and bring it to the pool for my morning workouts.  Warms up quickly in the shower and then doesn&#x27;t fog.  Great size, great price, great product.  Wholeheartedly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Ok, I&#x27;m a lady and I use the Shave Well mirror.  I use it when I wash my face, use my color-enhancing conditioner, shave my pits, etc...it&#x27;s awesome to be able to see what the heck you are doing!  This is a great, unbreakable, fog free and USEFUL item!  Just spend the bucks, you&#x27;ll be glad you did!!</li>
    <li> I held it for around 30 seconds under the stream so it would reach temperature. Fogged up as soon as I hung it up. Tried bringing it closer to the stream to keep its temperature, and it just got covered in water. Tried lowering it so keep its temperature, I was almost in a full squat to use it. Even using a squeegee after every stroke of the razor wouldn&#x27;t keep it fog-free.</li>
    <li> only fog free when you run it under scalding hot water... and then it after a little while it will fog up again...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not terrible but kind of small, and unless you have really good lighting in your shower than you need to keep wetting it/clearing it so that you can see well</li>
    <li> Is not fog free. enough said. needs to be run under hot water about every 5 minutes to prevent steam buildup, other than that, no complaints</li>
    <li> I gave 5 star rating because it really works. It is a small and thin mirror which makes it easy to warm up to the ambient temperature in the shower quickly and once it has warmed up sufficiently the fog goes away. I would love to see a concave mirror just like this. That will help better in shaving.</li>
    <li> I generally like the product but then it started peeling paint on the back side and affecting the front.  I still use it.</li>
    <li> THIS IS NOT TRULY FOG FREE.  it&#x27;s fine, and it doesn&#x27;t fog up immediately.  i don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s any better than cheaper &#x27;fogless&#x27; mirrors.</li>
    <li> Like many others, I thought there was something special about this mirror that helped it not to fog.  It&#x27;s called water!  In the instructions, it tells you to hold it under the warm water for about a minute to equalize the temperature between the mirror and the environment.  YOU CAN DO THAT TO ANY MIRROR!  I gave it four stars because it does, in fact, do exactly what is advertised.  However, I don&#x27;t need any special mirror to accomplish the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;Get a mirror at Walmart and run some water over it until it&#x27;s warm.  That&#x27;s all you need to do.  And you have the added benefit of getting a mirror that is aesthetically pleasing, rather than a piece of mirror that looks like it was cut from an assembly line.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my sons&#x27; shower.  they followed the directions and put it at the end on the wall, it works great for them.  i would recommend this.  we also got a letter from the manufacturer in the mail reiterating the directions and making sure we knew about the warranty - impressive.</li>
    <li> It is a simple, almost elegant solution for us shower shavers.  I have been a shower shaver for years and along the way have tried a variety of products.  But I grew tried of adding hot water to chambers or rubbing special towelettes on the surface.  This mirror works on simple physics; warm it under the shower stream and it will say clear and give you a nice shave.  After five minutes or so, if it starts to fog a bit just repeat the process.  The only change I made was in the method of cleaning; instead of toothpaste, I have found that 409 cleaner works best for me, keeps spots away and drops from clinging for about a week at a time. After a few weeks, I purchased the travel version, too and it works just as well.  Happy shaving.</li>
    <li> After reading the benefits of shaving in Men&#x27;s Health I decided to give it a try.  I quickly noticed the difficulty that not having a mirror in the shower presented.  This mirror works great and is unbreakable.  Now the only time I shave is in the shower, resulting in a cleaner, closer shave expanding the time between shaves</li>
    <li> Had to see with the water running down the mirror - it say to get wet with warm/ hot water - so it doesn&#x27;t steam up.  But still makes it hard to see through - I got it to help shave my armpits and it doesn&#x27;t work very good with that.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great when something as simple and inexpensive as this is so effective. I&#x27;ve been looking for a shower mirror for some time and this one is perfect.</li>
    <li> Its&#x27; just a piece of metal.  What do you expect? You get the metal hot by putting it under the shower.  Then the steam doesn&#x27;t accumulate.  It works but it isn&#x27;t as clear as the pictures would have you believe.</li>
    <li> this is a wonderful product for those who shaving every day. I strongly recommend every one to get this really fog free shower mirror.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror and the cost was awesome. You defiantly have to warm the mirror up but once you do that the mirror stays fog free</li>
    <li> It fogs up almost instantly in the shower and is just a small thin piece of mirror on a hook. Still works as a mirror if you run it under the hot water every 5 minutes so I gave it 2 stars.</li>
    <li> The mirror is very simple but it is very clear once you put it directly to the shower hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two months using it and it is working good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price it is worth</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews on Amazon, but I felt I had no choice in this matter. I gave this product 5 stars and I&#x27;ll explain why. After reading reviews for other fog resistant mirrors, I was weary about buying ANY of them. Nobody seemed happy with the purchase and it sounded like the whole idea of a fog resistant shower mirror was too good to be true, like nobody had really nailed the idea yet. Well, these guys have. The thing that sets this mirror apart from others that I looked at are two things; one, the hanging method is secure and stable, but designed so that the mirror can be easily lifted off at any time, which is important because two, it needs to be removable to truly achieve a fog free surface. The company uses a simple explanation of how the mirror does this using basic science. Basically you just have to lift the mirror off and let the shower water hit both sides for a few seconds. When you do, the mirror&#x27;s surface temperature rises to match the room temperature and condensation will no longer stick to the surface. It sounds weird, but it works EXTREMELY well and the mirror stays fog free more than enough time to complete a shave. Also of note, the mirror SEEMS small when you first see it, like it would be too small to shave comfortably, but once you use it, you will find it that the size is actually perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all that aside, the reason I REALLY wanted to write this review is because of the awesome customer service. When I attached the hanging hook to my bathroom wall, I foolishly hung it too low. I know, stupid mistake. But I could still use it by just leaning over, so I decided to live with it because I didn&#x27;t feel like screwing up the adhesive on the back of the hook. A day later, I got an email from the company&#x27;s Executive Vice President, asking if I was satisfied with the product and if he could answer any questions for me. I would have just left it alone, but since he emailed me, I decided to reply and ask if there was any way totake the hook off and reapply it without screwing up the adhesive. He confirmed that once the hook is removed, the adhesive is ruined and won&#x27;t stick again. But then, he asked my for mailing address and said he would ship me a new hook - completely free. A few days later, the new hook showed up in my mailbox. So basically, I screwed up the product myself, and the Vice President went out of his way to check on my product, and then offered to fix MY screw-up at his own expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Folks, you just don&#x27;t find customer service like that anymore. Not only is the product solid but the company is fantastic, and I have no reservations about recommending this to everybody.</li>
    <li> Been using my mirror for about a year now, with no complaints. I kind of wish I ordered the larger mirror, but that&#x27;s on me. I&#x27;m very happy with the way it&#x27;s held up over time.&lt;br /&gt;To use, simply run the mirror under the hot shower water, then hang back up, and stays fairly fog free for a while</li>
    <li> Much smaller than I expected, apparently I have no concept of size.  The small size is my own fault for not reading the description well, I should have ordered the larger one.  But I&#x27;m taking off one star because when you see this thing you&#x27;re going to think you got it from the dollar store.  It&#x27;s so light and cheap feeling, but you know what, it gets the job done and I&#x27;ve already had it for a few months and it&#x27;s holding up just fine.</li>
    <li> Must be under running water to be fog free.  Very nice under running water though.</li>
    <li> The fog-free coating lasted about four years.  Now it&#x27;s starting to become harder to keep fog-free, and also has trouble beading and shedding water.  So it&#x27;s time for a new one.  At $10, I&#x27;m not bothered at all by that.</li>
    <li> I have never bothered to write a review on Amazon before, but I am so amazed how much my life is improved by this $10 piece of glass I thought I would take the time.  Rinse it under the hot water, and it&#x27;s totally fog free.  if it fogs up, rinse it again.  it&#x27;s lightweight and detachable so you can hold it in your off hand and see whatever part of your face you&#x27;re working on SO MUCH easier than something permanently stuck to the wall.  the included hook for hanging it on the wall could be used to keep it in a position where you don&#x27;t have to hold it, but i prefer to hold it.  I didn&#x27;t use the hooks that came with it, I bought attractive 3m command hooks that match my shower hard wear (which I also use for hanging my shower poof) and it&#x27;s really great.</li>
    <li> Excellent customer service.  Easy to follow directions, which are repeated on the box, in the pamphlet, on stickers - you&#x27;d have to try hard to get this little mirror to fog.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I would caution is the placement of the hook. If you adhere it to a clean surface, it sticks!  If you want to pull it off to reposition it, you lose all the stickiness. So, make sure it&#x27;s where you want it to be before sticking it.&lt;br /&gt;That said, they promptly sent me a replacement hook, no questions asked!&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re considering this mirror, go for it!&lt;br /&gt;4.5 stars - I&#x27;m docking a half-star for not being able to reposition the hook once it&#x27;s in place.  Other than that, it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Great mirror that doesn&#x27;t fog. I have pretty sensitive skin and can only shave when taking hot showers. I&#x27;ve been using this 3-4 times per week for the past few years and it works perfectly. Cant beat the value for the price. Buy!</li>
    <li> Was looking for a small, simple mirror for shaving in the shower and this is perfect.  I opted not to use the hook so can&#x27;t really say how that works but the mirror is just as promised.  To get rid of any fog, all you have to do is simply run it under the water and presto - no more fog.</li>
    <li> fogs up even when put directly in steam/hot water</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. It is a really simple mirror, but it is so small. It is basically the size of my hand.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect example of misleading advertising.  This is just a regular flex mirror with instructions on how to keep the fog from building up on it.  What&#x27;s more, it doesn&#x27;t even stay fog free very well (and yes, that is even when following the instructions).  I can&#x27;t tell any difference between it and any other bathroom mirror I&#x27;ve had.  I hate companies that purposely mislead in their advertising, so as you can likely imagine, this really ticked me off.    The other problem with this mirror, is that the back reflective layer is now starting to peel off.  Without that layer, this is nothing more than a small piece of plexi glass.</li>
    <li> Very handy in the shower!  Actually I need to order two more!</li>
    <li> I think the guys who made this mirror have a different definition of &#x27;fog-free&amp;#34; than I do. Had to rub vinegar and shaving cream and all sorts of remedies on it and ended up giving up on my dreams of shaving in the shower.</li>
    <li> This thing is not rocket sciences but it&#x27;s a simple little product. Great price and easy to use. Totally worth it.</li>
    <li> Mirror works great and does the job it was designed to do.  The only problem I had with it was I noticed some of the bottom backing of the mirror flaking off slightly.  No big deal and wasn&#x27;t really noticeable unless you looked at the back.  Anyway, I thought it might have been a defect so I sent customer services a email.  They replied right away and sent me a replacement mirror at no extra cost.  I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> It does the job, and I don&#x27;t cut myself nearly as much as I used to. Even if there&#x27;s steam from the shower, just a splash of water on the mirror, and bang-zoom, there&#x27;s my handsome face again.</li>
    <li> At first, I did not realize this product I was ordering was simply a hook you stick to your shower wall, and a mirror that hangs on the hook. Now that it is all put together, i don&#x27;t mind so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror, being removable, is actualy very handy. In some cases, I need to take an extra look at places where the sun doesn&#x27;t shine, or on my back just to see if I scrubbed properly. THis helps not only for shaving in the shower, but those things where you never thought a mirror might otherwise be very handy in the shower.</li>
    <li> This product works exactly as described. You do have to follow the instructions and warm up both sides before using.</li>
    <li> It does well when warmed up with the hot water of the shower, but it would be nice if it retained heat a bit longer so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to keep immersing it in water every few minutes.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical that this dinky $10 mirror would solve the &amp;#34;how do I shave in the shower?&amp;#34; conundrum, but gosh darn it, it really did! Great product. Very well worth the money. The awesome reviews really swayed my decision and you should let them do the same for you.</li>
    <li> So far so good with this little mirror.  The reflective material is holding up well and the product does what it claims to do.  I sometimes find that I need to soak the mirror more than once to get through a complete shave, but this is a minor thing.  It really is a small mirror, but again not a problem.  The supplied sticker hook is holding up well.</li>
    <li> Best inexpensive bathroom accesory I own!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving in the shower is so much easier now. The adhesive hook seems to still be sturdy since move in day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 Step process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Rinse the mirror under water once your shower is at the temperature you enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Rehang the mirror on the hook and use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best idea ever.</li>
    <li> After trying other fogless mirrors (all of which hooked into the faucet), I decided to give this one a shot.  The bottom line is, it works perfectly.  I&#x27;m happy with the product, and I&#x27;m really pleased with the great customer service.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s simple.  Run it under the shower head UP BY THE SHOWER HEAD so that it gets the full heat of the water.  Mount it in the middle of the shower, not clear in the back, so it stays warmer longer.  It works, without question, its cheap, and you can use it for whatever else you might need a mirror for, since it&#x27;s just dangling on a hook.</li>
    <li> as described and praised by others: works as advertized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;some complains of fogging, but i haven&#x27;t had any issues. Running it under hot water for couple seconds is all that&#x27;s needed.</li>
    <li> (This is an edit)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product. It was inexpensive, a good size, and it gets the job done. It&#x27;s lightweight with rounded edges, so even if you drop it you&#x27;re not going to sever a toe.. or even hurt its feelings, really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not read the box, as I bought it for a gift for my husband and wrapped it immediately upon receipt, and I missed the *VERY* helpful tidbit on cleaning - if your mirror starts to get cloudy because you leave it wet when you get out of the shower every day for weeks, it&#x27;s actually very, very easy to clean. Use toothpaste and a bit of water. I had tried windex, a washcloth, a lemon and vinegar, and none of it really helped. A dab of toothpaste, however, cleaned it in perhaps 45 seconds of rather squishy amusement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the staff here seem to be very courteous and helpful. Here&#x27;s a small quote of the sort of stand-by-our-product-while-supporting-the-consumer attitude I&#x27;m talking about - \\&quot;Quite frankly, we will not be satisfied until you are...\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...Well then. I did not expect that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well done, guys!</li>
    <li> Handy mirror seems to live up to no fog label if you follow instructions and heat it up first.  I thought I&#x27;d&lt;br /&gt;try shaving in the shower, you&#x27;re wet and ready to rinse off anyway, but for me there is one caveat.  The&lt;br /&gt;mirror does it&#x27;s job but my shower, as I suspect is true for most, has only an overhead light.  You don&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;get the best illumination of your facial landscape while attacking same with a sharp object.  Sure, it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;fairly easy to miss the ears but watch out for your neck.</li>
    <li> This is better than the big fancy kinds of shower mirrors, I store it in my shower caddy and hold in it my hand and shave with the other. Works great, haven&#x27;t had to use shaving cream since I got it.</li>
    <li> Per the included directions, I run the mirror under hot water first and it stays fogfree with plenty of time for me to shave. This is a great invention.</li>
    <li> I use this.  But it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;truly fog free&amp;#34;.  When it arrived, I was surprised how small the mirror is.  Overall not bad for the price...</li>
    <li> I hate having to shower by my sink bc I create a big wet mess all,over my countertop. Now with this mirror I am able to shower and shave and get anything as wet as I like with no regard for human life. The only complaint I have is that I wish I got the bigger one, but this small one does the job just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The important thing is to read the directions before putting this little bad boy up in your shower. I haven&#x27;t needed to clean it yet or change the adhesive after three months.</li>
    <li> I liked that you can lift the mirror off of the hook so easily. I&#x27;ve had other mirrors that were pretty much anchored to the wall by suction cups, and those were always a pain.</li>
    <li> The mirror is NOT fog free. There is nothing else to say. Try another product. The hangover also came of my glass door.</li>
    <li> For shaving in the shower and on the go, you cannot beat this little jewel. Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. We had seen other shower mirrors for twice the price. This one feels lighter and cheaper than I expected.. would have rather paid a couple dollars less... BUT, it does work. It has a hook which I installed with no issues when I followed the directions to clean the shower with isopropyl alcohol. And when you dip it in hot water as directed it warms up-- no condensation (AKA fog). Seems to have stopped my husband from cutting himself so often when he is shaving in the shower.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband and he was really pleased with it. Its is fogless but you do have to follow the directions and warm the mirror in the shower but thats not a problem. It was a little smaller than I expected but its more than adaquate.</li>
    <li> This mirror works very well in the shower and by following the instructions, I have no fog in the mirror which is great for shaving. The awesome part though, is the customer service by this company. After my purchase, they sent me a follow up email repeating the installation and usage instructions. I had already installed the mirror but by mistake had stuck the hook too high on my shower wall ... I replied to the support email asking where I could purchase an additional hook - they responded and said they will send a replacement to me; and they did, free of cost!.&lt;br /&gt;I am a promoter!</li>
    <li> Works quite well. Downside is that the mount is permanent.</li>
    <li> Mirror worked great for the week I had it. But that is all it lasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get any ammonia-based cleaners on it. It peals off the back and distorts the &amp;#34;mirror&amp;#34; portion as well.</li>
    <li> Great item, just as described!</li>
    <li> No complaints about this fog-free performance of this product. It works. I took away one star because it&#x27;s a little small. Otherwise, I appreciate the ability to take it off the included hook easily, instead of having to pry a suction cup off of the wall, if I ever need to pack it, etc. Also, about two days after I received the item, I got an email from someone at the company that had a few extra cleaning and maintenance tips. Definitely like that kind of proactive reaching out.</li>
    <li> Does just as it says, and makes shaving in the shower a breeze.  Try it - you&#x27;ll never go back!</li>
    <li> if you want to be able to shave in the shower with a fog-free mirror, this thing solves your problem.  cheap, too.</li>
    <li> This mirror works. It does get foggy, but it does so far less readily or often as other mirrors that claim to be fog free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little piece of advice?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not place the hook in such a way that the mirror is going to be flat against the wall and stuck to it because it gets wet.&lt;br /&gt;Instead, place it so that it hangs a quarter inch away from the wall.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s now gonna fog less!&lt;br /&gt;But, now, it&#x27;s gonna shake and sing, because you breath swings it.&lt;br /&gt;So, place a couple of those rubber round half-ball glue-on feet on the wall.&lt;br /&gt;They will provide support so that it doesn&#x27;t swing around.&lt;br /&gt;(Another lesson here is that you should try to breathe away from the mirror, as your breath is far hotter than the shower mist (no pun intended).)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a complete solution, it sucks. But, hey, we live in an imperfect world.&lt;br /&gt;And this mirror gets to being as fog free as this imperfect world allows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Impeccable packaging and shipment.</li>
    <li> THis item has corrected some issue we had in the shower.  Once warmed up it will not fog over. It is light enough to handle with one hand. The hole for hanging also is thumb size so you can grip it with wet hands. the care instruction gave new hints to care of this mirror and we applied them to other items and found it worked to \\&quot;clean\\&quot; off the water spots there as well. Wonderful item. love it</li>
    <li> I have been using \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirrors for years now and this is, hands down, one of the best.  I love the simplisity and the no-frills syle.  (So many mirrors are so bulky and take up way more room than they need to.)  I have been using it for several weeks now and have no complaints.  I take it off the hook, run it under the hot water and shave away. Highly, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this now for a few months and can attest to the fact that it DOESN&#x27;T WORK well at all. The first couple of uses there didn&#x27;t seem to be any fog build up, but the coating didn&#x27;t last long. It was very inexpensive, but you still have the expectation that the product would work as advertised...TRULY FOG FREE--now that is a joke!</li>
    <li> Bought this after my expensive mirror with suction cups kept falling off. This one works great at much lower price.</li>
    <li> Its OK. It still fogs.</li>
    <li> Run under the water for it to become fog free...then you have about 6-8 munutes before it fogs up again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a mirror.  I keep it in the shower to shave with.  Fogs like any other mirror would.  Best thing I&#x27;ve found is to use ANY mirror (I like this one only cause it hangs and isn&#x27;t very large) and apply Rain X to the mirror every month.  This will keep the fog from forming and instead bead and run down the mirror leaving a clean reflective mirror.</li>
    <li> Finally something that works as advertised. Saves me time and easier than ever before. Use it often. Highly recommend getting one of these.</li>
    <li> I CUT MYSELF taking the protective sticker on the front of it and bled all over my bathroom. No, there are no warnings or indications that it can happen easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and it DOES FOG, so this adds insult to literal injury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend came home late on day after yoga and did not know about or why there was a mirror on the counter so she decided to hang it up in the shower, but CUT HERSELF as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is TOO SMALL anyways and is just garbage! Do not buy this unless you are a self cutter that does not need to see yourself in a steamy shower, then this is for you. (please stop cutting yourself!) :)</li>
    <li> I have had this mirror for about a week now and each shower worked out perfectly.  I shave my head and face so it takes about 10 minutes or so, all my other \\&quot;fog free\\&quot; mirrors stayed fog free for about 45 seconds.  This one works great, and the trick of running it under water makes it perfect.  Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Works just as advertised. I didn&#x27;t like the hook it came with because it is basically permanent so I got a section cup hook and since the mirror isn&#x27;t heavy it works great. If I had to purchase again, I would probably get the larger one.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much at the price. Something that was functional enough but not that great. This is a travel sized mirror that actually works as a full size mirror replacement. Packs well. Works well. Just make sure before you buy that you pruchase the mount appropriate to the environment where you plan to use it. The hole for the hook is a pretty good size, though, so you can get away with using other hooks you have around. The mirror it quite light so command hooks or really just about anything that can hold over a few ounces will do fine. I haven&#x27;t been particularly rough with it, but it seems like it would be fine for camping or a business trip.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it claims to do, no more, no less. Perfect for shaving in the shower, a quick rinse under the water if it is at all foggy and it&#x27;s good to go.</li>
    <li> at first i had a problem with the product i believe it might have been a defective back piece that sticks to my shower wall...BUT i got a prompt email after i wrote my first review stating that my back piece didn&#x27;t stick and i was sent a new one... it&#x27;s been sticking for a while now so all is well and the mirror comes as shown in the picture.  i have to add that the customer service is AMAZING....VERY prompt and VERY nice! They even sent me a follow up email asking about my second attempt at mounting the mirror on my wall..i like the mirror.. it does what it&#x27;s intended to and it doesnt fall off the wall</li>
    <li> This thing still gets fogged up... I dont really care because its not hard to get it wet for a second then hang it back up but it isnt &amp;#34;Fog Free&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Simple, affordable and it works.  What more do you need?  Just wet it, hang it back up, and shave..perfect.  My husband loves this product and uses it all the time.</li>
    <li> The mirror works fine. However it is not fogless but a little hot water and it&#x27;s fog free for several minutes.</li>
    <li> This does exactly what it is supposed to do.  It sticks to my shower wall, and it reflects my image.  You hold it under the water for a few seconds, and it doesn&#x27;t fog up.  If I take an especially long time to shave, it may start fog up again, so you just stick it back under the water, and no more fog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is really light (some type of plexiglass), but it reflects as good as any other mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked it enough that I bought a second for the vacation home.</li>
    <li> The package comes with an adhesive hook, which sticks to the tiles over your tub. The mirror is very light and stays fog-free if you run it under the water spray for 10 seconds or so. Overall, a nice product.</li>
    <li> Directions indicate that you must use denatured alcohol while mounting the mirror.  Haven&#x27;t found denatured alcohol so haven&#x27;t mounted it.  Maybe it works great, but who knows?</li>
    <li> This is very basic, but for $10 it does the job.  If you don&#x27;t take the 15 or 20 seconds to run it under hot water, it will fog up, but that&#x27;s easily remedied.  I would like one that&#x27;s a little larger, but this will work for the time being.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had many fog free mirrors over the years and this $10 mirror blew the prior ones out of the water. No fancy reservoirs, no built in shelf for your razor--just a working, fog free mirror. All the others I&#x27;ve owned started fogging up by the first week, but this one hasn&#x27;t and doesn&#x27;t show signs that it will. Perfect!</li>
    <li> 1st-The \\&quot;Will Not fall off the wall\\&quot; statement is not exactly true. The mirror comes with a plastic hook with a white sticky adhesive backing that allows the mirror to be placed on/taken off as needed. Now the problem is, that hook will not stay stuck on any/all tiles.I have the little glass squares (approx. 1\\&quot; X 1\\&quot;) and it will not adhere to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd-Not an issue, but the mirror is small, (think of those magnet locker mirrors people used to have in school)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3rd-The manufacturers guarantee \\&quot;No Fog\\&quot; as its pure science that as long as you put the mirror front and back under water that is the same temp as the steam the shower is currently producing you will have a \\&quot;fog free\\&quot; experience. I have a steam unit for my shower, the temp gets to over 110 degrees so it is difficult for me to have the results claimed or in this case, desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, buy this if you are sure the hook will adhere, you do not have steam for your shower</li>
    <li> This was not what I was expecting in terms of size. It is very small.  Also there is no fog free technology. Its just an acrylic mirror like you can pick up at Walmart for 2 bucks. Same thing with the hook.  Save your money and buy a regular mirror and wipe it down with toothpaste. An old scuba trick that really makes things fog free.</li>
    <li> If you use this properly it&#x27;s an awesome mirror for the shower. Once the water is hot, just hold the mirror under the stream for about 30 seconds and it wont fog up at all. Perfect for shaving. Love this thing.</li>
    <li> This mirror is working well so far.  You should run it under the shower&#x27;s water to get it truely fog free like they recommend.  My old mirror had water spots that I couldn&#x27;t get rid of.  So far this one looks clear and clean.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband because he always dirties up the sink when he shaves. He likes that he&#x27;s able to shave in the bathtub and not worry about the mess. It works great and hangs great next to the shower. It&#x27;s durable. I dropped it once by accident, but it didn&#x27;t break.  When it fogs up a little bit (all mirrors do when hot steam is present), you just have to run under the shower for a second. I use it to look at myself when I shower. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I have used this mirror 2 days now.  It works as advertised.  Great price.  The mirror does stay fog free.  Life is good :)</li>
    <li> This product does the job but is not worth what I paid for it. It is very cheaply made and not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I found the mirror extremely good&lt;br /&gt;I found that the product did as advertised&lt;br /&gt;As I fixed the hook to my bathroom tiles to set up my mirror I accidentally Brook the hook I than&lt;br /&gt;e.mali the company to see weather or not thy wood replace the broken hook  and thy did without any questions asked of me&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with my purchase and wood order from this company again thy were very good and reliable and help full&lt;br /&gt;  Thank you .</li>
    <li> Had it for about two months, fog or mist washes off of it and doesn&#x27;t come back for awhile, so it&#x27;s pretty helpful when shaving. It comes with a stick-on hook for your shower wall that I also put a showering brush for my back onto.</li>
    <li> This mirror makes it easy to shave while showering saving some time and making sure my face is clean after shaving. Follow the directions that are provided to ensure you get a fog less shave and while in the shower you can always wipe away any fog that has formed as well perfect size and practically weightless makes it easy to hold in one hand with a razor in the other.</li>
    <li> Really happy with it.  It is small enough to easily pick up and run the required warm water over it , and plenty big to see your whole face.  Very clear reflection with some water beads that do not interfere with your shave.  Wish it had a little hook for my razor though.</li>
    <li> This item was cheap for a reason.  With a little bit of repetition it gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Fog Free&amp;#34; is completely true, you just have to run it under water for a second every minute or so.  It gets old quick but for the price it works until I find something better.</li>
    <li> I have now had this mirror for two years or so. It&#x27;s relatively light, a good size for one-handed use, and durable. It travels well and takes a beating. It&#x27;s been dropped, stepped on, tossed around, etc. The only sign of wear is a slight flaking of the mirror coating on the back on one corner. The hole makes it easy to hang almost anywhere. Highly recommended for hiking, camping, travel, and day-to-day use.</li>
    <li> Great value, definitely stays fog free.  The provided hook has weak adhesive and fell after a couple days but I just hang the mirror elsewhere now.  Caution:  the mirror does scratch easily so handle with care.</li>
    <li> After two weeks of daily use the mirror stated to fog during shaving.  I got rid of my old one because of this and I now have the same problem with a new one.  Not worth the money I spent.</li>
    <li> Nothing great, not terrible either. It came with a sticky hook for the mirror that said it I&#x27;d for tile. I want sure if it would damage Pyrex so xi didn&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I bought the big one and the small one (need one to see the back of my head to shave my big noggin).  I don&#x27;t bother with holding them in the water spray, just throw them on the shower floor and all that running water will warm them up.  If they fog up after that, you&#x27;re way too slow at taking a shower - get some vitamins in your life or something, pokey.</li>
    <li> The mirror will get foggy every now and then, and I sometimes need to hold it under the water for a bit to defog it again, but this is not much of a hassle.</li>
    <li> So far, an awesome fog free mirror! Lightweight. Easily removed from hanger. Crystal clear. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a plastic mirror with a plastic hook. There&#x27;s nothing &amp;#34;UNIQUE&amp;#34; or clever about this mirror, other than the marketing and hype. It should be considered false advertising, in fact. &amp;#34;Truly fogless by design&amp;#34; is a false statement. There is nothing fogless about the mirror itself. You HAVE to run it under the warm water, and even then it quickly fogs up in about 30 seconds. Due to its plastic design, the water beads up nicely on the front of this mirror, which impairs your vision to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you have here is a plastic mirror worth about $0.55, a plastic hook with adhesive worth about $0.15, a thin protection sheet worth about $0.05, and a colorful printed box and instructions worth about $0.25 (all in bulk). The marketing team behind this mirror spends at least twice that amount per mirror in advertising and hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a little clue - ANY mirror is &amp;#34;fog free&amp;#34; if you run it under the shower water to warm it up. I find it very hard to believe there are that many people happy paying $10 for something you could find at a dollar store that works just as well. Heck, you could even use the broken shard of a truck stop mirror stuck to your shower wall with the piece of gum you found on the bathroom stall and it would be exactly as &amp;#34;fog free by design&amp;#34; as this mirror. Just pull it off the gum, run it under the warm water, then stick it back on the gummy adhesive. Bam! Fog Free mirror! (I&#x27;m certain the US patent office would even grant you a patent for that &amp;#34;unique&amp;#34; truck stop design and feel.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor; spend the $10 towards a removable shower head and keep the mirror you already have. Then you can bring the shower head to the mirror to warm it up and make it &amp;#34;fog free&amp;#34; instead of lining the pockets of these false advertising scammers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One star for the ability to remove it from the hook to clean all the fog and beaded water off the mirror when I&#x27;m done showering.</li>
    <li> I used it like you are suppose to and wet the back but still gets foggy. Plus once you get water on it the water sticks and then it is hard to see</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this. Light and easy to use. Never had any issues with it. A must have for someone who shaves in the shower.</li>
    <li> This makes shaving in the shower a breeze. Easy to install and in over a year of use, not a single issue with it.</li>
    <li> This mirror works very well and was easy to install.  It is so much easier to have that close shave, looking best for my clients [...] before I leave the shower instead of having to shave over again in front of a sink when I am starting to get cold.  Staying warm the whole time, while in the shower, seems to make the shave easier.  My skin has more comfort too.</li>
    <li> Like others, I wished this had a close up feature but it works ok for what it is, even if it&#x27;s a little pricey.</li>
    <li> Works great, very simple design.  Just hold the mirror under the hot water for a few seconds on each side and your fog free for an entire shave, its fogs up again just hold it back under the water for a few.  Highly recommend it.  Price is great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit small (could be an inch or two larger), but I believe there&#x27;s a slightly larger version out there.  But it usually stays fog-free throughout my entire shave.  On occasion I&#x27;ll need to rewarm it under the shower spray in order to finish the last 10-20% of my shave, but I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks and it&#x27;s working well so far.</li>
    <li> Great product... once you initially clear off the fog from the steam, it does not fog up again! I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> So, basically, their two promises in the description, \\&quot;Truly fogless by design. Will not fall off of the wall,\\&quot; proved false within the first week of use. Yes, I followed the instructions, and yes I&#x27;ve had fogless mirrors in the past. I usually run the mirror under hotter water than I shower with first to keep it hotter than the shower will actually be, but it still only lasts a few minutes. I could get the same results from any handheld mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hook was placed on a clean and dry tile, and fell off within a week. Luckily, I had a spare suction cup hook lying around. I use this mirror because I don&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of returning it, but honestly it&#x27;s pretty terrible. They could have at least put a hydrophobic coating on it, or something to make it better than your average non-fog-free mirror.</li>
    <li> this mirror is a birthday gift to my husband of 32 years !! He likes it so much.It is definately fogless and very clear to look through.</li>
    <li> So I shave in the shower and mirrors SUCK!!! But not this one!!!! It really works and Every guy who shaves in the shower should have one!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a mirror to shave in the shower for years, and always only found ones that mostly worked - until now. This mirror is very simple yet effective. I had previously owned an OXO brand mirror, which worked for the most part. As to other reviews - it is a little small, but I&#x27;ve had no problems seeing what I&#x27;m doing. I did notice that the \\&quot;few seconds\\&quot; to warm up the mirror is more like 15-20 seconds, not like that&#x27;s a long time. Another thing I like about its simplicity - it doesn&#x27;t have parts to break. My OXO fell in the shower a couple times, and the specially designed suction cup broke, and was subsequently hung on the shower curtain for the past couple of years. Overall - great mirror, great price.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  Simple.  Works.  Low-cost.  Wish I had replaced my previous shower mirror months ago.  Warm mirror under shower, wipe with my towel, use.</li>
    <li> One morning while I was hungover, I got excited to put this in my shower.  Mounted this thing right away when I realized I mounted the hook too damn low.  Silly me, I thought I could just remove it and stick it to another location... nope.  I ended up breaking the plastic hook and I was hook-less for a week or so.  I ended up going to the local pharmacy and picked up a suction cup with a hook attached to it.  Perfect!  Problem 1 solved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for the mirror itself... I followed directions by heating this mirror up on both sides before using it.  I found it kind of irritating that the water beaded up all over the place.  I&#x27;m not talking rain beads, i&#x27;m talking tiny beads. It was enough to not be able to see yourself clearly while you shave.  I just read a couple reviews saying to clean this mirror with toothpaste, so we shall see the efficacy of this!</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror to make it easier for my husband to shave in the shower.  His only complaint is that it is smaller than he thought it would be.  It&#x27;s about the size of a 3 x 5 index card so it is not a large mirror.  Other than that it has completely lived up to his expectations.</li>
    <li> If it wasn&#x27;t clear from the description, this mirror is a small piece of mirrored plastic (plexiglass) with a thumbhole in it, and an adhesive hook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sure liked the idea of a mirror with no metal to rust, as that seems to be the downfall of all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there are two key problems with this mirror.. first, because it hangs from the peg, it tends to be pointing a different direction every time.  You have to dance a little to get into view.  It doesn&#x27;t help that the mirror is really pretty small.  You might end up just holding it in one hand, rather than letting it dangle at odd angles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, you have to run it under the water to warm up and stop fogging.  That&#x27;s the plan.  The problem then is that you have beaded drops of water all over the mirror.  You have to wipe it or clean it off to use.  Even wiped, it is distorted and hard to see well over the wet mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, not a keeper.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror for a different reason than most: to help my 5 year-old learn how to properly shampoo his hair! He was missing spots and couldn&#x27;t quite \\&quot;feel\\&quot; them, so I researched a lot of other shower mirrors before finally deciding on this one. It stays fog free when my son remembers to warm it up and it does get some water beading on it during the shower (we have it hung at his eye level at the far end of a tub/shower combo), but it has helped him be able to see and he has become a better hair washer (and incidentally also a better goofy face maker) thanks to the mirror. I also need to say that it is durable! Being a 5 year-old, you can imagine how many times it has been dropped and it shows zero sign of damage! I only wish, like others mentioned, that it was slightly larger. I can really appreciate how nicely it fits in an adult hand for the purpose of shaving in the shower, but for my purpose, a tad larger would add the extra star. Overall, I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> After ordering one of these, I&#x27;ve ordered 3 more to leave at other places so I don&#x27;t have to carry it around with me.  By not relying on chemical treatments on the glass and only using water heat, this thing works perfect, is cheap, small, and never seems to go bad.</li>
    <li> I like to shave (and sing) in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who doesn&#x27;t?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, its not as easy as it sounds........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its not the actual shaving part that is hard-- its trying to SEE what you are doing that is difficult!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that water, all that fog!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had many different \\&quot;fog free mirrors\\&quot; and well, they all kinda work and kinda don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All claim some special and magical solution....Some attach to the shower head. Some have a special spray for the surface, and others say they are the best and fail to explain why or how.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is simple. It works. No made up claims and no silly connections or sprays are needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is--- it is much smaller in size than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gave the measurements on the website description--- but I did not pay close enough attention to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite that glitch. I LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Light, durable, and right size. Because of the bathroom light, I have to hold it in my hand. The mirror had some chipping and Cumberland shipped a new one immediately without hassles, and then followed up via email.</li>
    <li> Well what can I say.&lt;br /&gt;It works EXACTLY as advertized! No joke, no lie. Turn on the shower, the steam generated warms the mirrored surface and WOW no more fog! Occasionally the mirror will re-fog, but have no fear, hold it under the warm running water for a few seconds and you&#x27;re good to go again.&lt;br /&gt;If you shave in the shower as I do this is a must have.</li>
    <li> The mirror works as advertised. Simply run it under the hot water for a little bit and it stays fogless easily long enough to shave.  Note how it works: the mirror must be at a temperature higher than the air temperature.  If it&#x27;s fogging up quickly it&#x27;s because the mirror dropped below the air temperature.  Possibly it&#x27;s too high, above the shower curtain, and catching a breeze from outside the shower or maybe you need to keep under the warm water longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the mirror works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I have owned several shaving mirrors for my shower. This is definitely the best one yet. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> The mirror for use around water and shower mist works well.  Like the fact it is NOT glass.  Satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> You need to hold this thing under the water to be &amp;#34;fog free&amp;#34; but it still fogs.  For the money it is a great purchase though!</li>
    <li> This mirror is perfect for what&#x27;s intended for. If you follow the directions, you can make sure the mirror stays fog free. Considering the directions are VERY simple, you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a bit too small. I know the manufacturer has responded in one of the comments saying that they made it small enough to hold with one hand as you shave, but I still think if it was a bit bigger you could still hold it with one hand and see more of your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great mirror for the shower, can stay fog free as long as you need it by holding it under hot water periodically, but it&#x27;s just a tad bit too small for me. I suppose it&#x27;ll do for now until I find a bigger one.</li>
    <li> Works great - just make sure you follow the directions and run it under the warm water to keep it fog free.</li>
    <li> Finally,  A nice \\&quot;fog Free\\&quot; mirror that does what the adverisement states.  The mirror is easy to install and is truly fog free after it is warmed up.  Personally I would have appreciated a slightly larger version but the size is acceptable and I have been using it daily without complaint.</li>
    <li> If you actually had this little mirror in your hands at a local pharmacy you would not be willing to pay ten bucks for it. It is a three or four dollar item at the most in my humble opinion. The fog free part is purest bunkum - it is no more or less fog free than any other piece of plastic with a reflective backing. And I am totally dubious about how legit all those five star reviews are - I suspect they are just there to overwhelm the real reviews.</li>
    <li> This mirror does exactly what it is intended to do.  It comes with the double-sided tape and a hook allowing it to be hung on practically any shower surface.  When the mirror gets fogged you can simply remove it from the hook and rinse it under the water.  I am very pleased with this at the price point and simplicity.  The customer service of this company is also wonderful.  I needed to get another hook because I wanted to mount it higher and asked where I could find them so I could purchase one.  The owner of the company sent me a response the same day and told me he would send me one at no charge.  You can&#x27;t beat a company that has a product that works well and stands behind it - even when you do a bone headed thing like mount the hook too low.</li>
    <li> No big loss, as it was inexpensive. but yeah this thing fogs up within just a few minutes and you have to keep wiping it off. I know the company is insiting on here that you have to warm the mirror up but i&#x27;ve tried that ad naseum. oh well. i can still get use out of it.</li>
    <li> This mirror is truly fog free. Use as directed and you will be very pleased. This is my 2nd one. I would not consider any other mirror as this one has exceeded my expectations!</li>
    <li> This mirror stayed fog free and stuck to the wall well. I Am Very happy with my purchase. I would definelty recommend this mirror.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised. Hang it face level, rinse briefly in your shower, then you&#x27;re ready to shave fog-free. The company follows up with an email to give guidance on properly hanging &amp; using the mirror, which is a nice customer service touch.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift for my husband for Christmas. He seems to enjoy it, and I don&#x27;t have to clean hair out of the bathroom sink anymore!</li>
    <li> The first time I used it I thought I got scammed. However, after reading the instructions, I found out you have to wash it from the front and back with the same water you&#x27;re showering under. That is because it has to get heated up a bit so that it does not get foggy. Simple, great, and inexpensive. If you need it, go for it!</li>
    <li> I shave in the shower, so I&#x27;d been on the lookout for a &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirror. This mirror worked miracles for me. I do wish it was bigger, but then it wouldn&#x27;t be so easy to handle and hold in my hand. It has chipped a little at the bottom of it, but that is a minor quibble. This works great!</li>
    <li> Compared to others I have used, this one is the best.  When it starts to have a little fog on it, you just put it under the warm water (both sides), and hang it back up. Very cool product.</li>
    <li> I can highly recommend this product after now using it for a couple weeks. The ability to take the mirror off the mount means easily cleaning it off and matching the water temps to remain fog-free. I have had no issues with the included hook, even though I was initially concerned about it&#x27;s sturdiness on my tile shower. The suction-cup mirrors always fail and fall and they are annoying to take off to clean. In addition, this mirror is super light and fits perfectly in your hand so you can shave and get different angles. I have yet to have it fog up and mine is mounted on the adjacent wall to the shower head and about 1.5 feet below the head. This doesn&#x27;t allow for colder air up high to fog it up.&lt;br /&gt;A+</li>
    <li> I love this mirror! It works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried over the past 20 years, and I&#x27;ve tried everything. I got mine a year ago as a gift, now while browsing razors Amazon just &amp;#34;suggested&amp;#34; it to me (good call, +1 for the computer programmers) and my deep love for this little joker prompted me to stop and review it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It does not fog when used as directed. Even I can figure it out and have zero problems wherever I roam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) It seems indestructible, when I drop it I don&#x27;t even bother checking it for damage. No batteries or laser beams or other silly junk to break!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) It weighs nothing, so it goes with me every weekend out of town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) It&#x27;s very easy to hold with one hand while shaving (I stick a finger or thumb through the hole so I drop it less often) This led to an unexpected benefit, no matter where I travel I can find a position where I get a little light, even if that means a goofy position looking up at the mirror over my head to catch the light in some random dark guest shower.</li>
    <li> Did they mean foggy?? Guess who has 2 thumbs and is returning this tommorow?? This Guy Waste of $10 yessir</li>
    <li> I did a lot of searching and decided to gamble with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror is small but it gets the job done!  It might need reheated in the water a couple times but is easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key to these shower mirrors is placement.  If you place it correctly you will love it.  There is no secret or magic mirror.  Anything that holds water is going to generate mold and mildew.  This simple mirror is light, takes up very little space, and does not need to hold water to give you plenty of time to shave when placed correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO the instructions are very clear and explain exactly what you need to do to get the best results from the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps you decide, I know I had a lot of trouble and the reviews seemed very mixed!</li>
    <li> Its tiny, I repeat tiny.</li>
    <li> We all know there&#x27;s no real fog-free mirrors unless it has a heating element. This is the next best thing. I&#x27;ve tried all different shower mirrors, and this is by far my favorite. When I used to use the regular old suction cup mirrors, I would have to splash water on it to keep it from fogging up. With this, I just grab it off the hook and run it under the water for a few seconds. It keeps it fog-free long enough to finish shaving. My only recommendation is to replace the hook with a 3M Command hook or a suction cup hook.</li>
    <li> So this mirror works pretty well. When you hold it under the shower spray to warm it up it does stop fogging up. However, I had a problem where the sticker on the back started peeling off the reflective backing of the mirror. This started happening after it was in my shower for a while. Not sure if pulling the sticker of when I got it would have helped. When I removed the sticker it started taking more of the backing off. You may want to remove the sticker when you get it.</li>
    <li> This is definitely not really fog free.  The mirror is great for the shower, but it does constantly fog up.  You have to run it through the shower head water in order to defog it.  It is a piece of mirror plastic and does provide a reflection for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+made of plastic that does not break when drops&lt;br /&gt;+small compact design&lt;br /&gt;+offers reflection for shaving&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;+definitely is not fog free as advertised&lt;br /&gt;+kind of small for a mirror&lt;br /&gt;+pricey for a piece of plastic</li>
    <li> I have used this mirror for 6 months now and am very happy with its performance.  It does what it promises well and has held up despite being dropped twice.</li>
    <li> I received this mirror as a Christmas present. About a month ago, I had an issue with the mirror. The reflective material came off the bottom edge of the mirror. I wrote the company an email, and within 24 hours I had a personalized email directly from the president of the company, WOW! He immediately asked me for my address, and mailed me a new mirror, no questions asked. I even received a business card with his personal email, and phone number. This company sets the new standard for customer service, and all others should follow suit. I would not hesitate one bit to order any other product from this company, as they truly do stand behind their products! Bravo!!</li>
    <li> Fogless, just as it says in the item description. Instead of depending on complicated mechanisms like running warm water through the unit or using batteries to heat a coil, this mirror offers a simple solution - just unhook the mirror, place it under the shower stream for a few seconds, and presto, ambient and mirror temparatures equalize and therefore no fog, at least for a while. It is a little smaller than I thought it would be, but I can live with that. Good deal for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of shaving mirrors through the years and this is the only one that has stood the test of time.  It&#x27;s easy to install and works every time.  Just warm the mirror in the under the shower for 5 sec and hang it back up.  It&#x27;s even survived multiple falls without a scratch.  The fact that I&#x27;m writing a review shows how much I like this thing.</li>
    <li> This mirror works well, but it is not fog free.  It is a lot smaller than I thought.  Guess I should have read size closer. I bought a suction cup hook for it that sticks better.</li>
    <li> The mirror is fine. It didn&#x27;t come with the wall hook. So, I have to hold the mirror with my hands like some sort of savage.</li>
    <li> Did not really work well for me.&lt;br /&gt;The sticky in the back did not even stick properly, such a shame.</li>
    <li> The mirror is made of a clear hard plastic with a reflective backing. It is small enough to be hand held, but perhaps a bit smaller than I would have liked - I had to tilt the mirror this way and that to get the correct viewing angles while shaving. It stays fog free as advertised as long as you let it heat up as instructed.&lt;br /&gt;The instructions to heat the mirror up first are present all over the packaging and various instruction stickers, and the company even sends you an email reminding you to heat the mirror up under the water, and why you should do this. And indeed they are right. The mirror, while cold, fogged up terribly. When heated up for a bit under the shower, the fog went away entirely, and the mirror was perfectly usable.&lt;br /&gt;I was not able to get it hot enough to remove all condensation entirely, there were still small beads of water scattered on the surface even after several minutes of direct hot water spray, but this did not affect my ability to use the mirror at all. I got a good shave in the shower, which was great. I am near-sighted and used this without glasses, so that was also a plus.</li>
    <li> Love it.... A really light weight mirror, works well in the shower. I can SEE... Not all fogged up like most mirrors</li>
    <li> If you cant figure out how to work this mirror you cant figure out how to come here to read ratings. Its not a big mirror but it easily does what it says it does.  Worth the money for me.</li>
    <li> I wish this thing was just a bit wider but it works great.  I shave in the shower and have dropped this thing a bunch of times with no worries.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t lie!  If you follow the instructions and let the warm water of your shower warm up BOTH sides of the mirror, it will remain fogless for quite sometime!</li>
    <li> This mirrior is much better than my last. It is not a &amp;#34;glass&amp;#34; mirror but certainly looks like a glass mirror. Very good quality. All you have to do is run it in the running warm water for 2-3 seconds and it wont fog up! Makes shaving in the shower great!</li>
    <li> Simply put, it works. The mount works. The mirror image is clear and crisp. And most importantly, it stays fog free for the duration of my shave.</li>
    <li> It worked and looked great for the first year....it fogs up and the mirror finish is coming off.&lt;br /&gt;The suction part is great, it has not fallen off as other mirror suction&#x27;s have.</li>
    <li> This mirror is not only inexpensive but it just works. At long last, a shave mirror that doesn&#x27;t fog up on me 10 seconds into my shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, the customer service was fantastic.  Shortly after receiving the package, I somehow misplaced the hanger that sticks to the shower&#x27;s glass door which is used to hold up the mirror. So, I emailed he company, asking if I could buy that part. I quickly received a response from presumably the owner who said he would send me a new one, without charge.  The new part arrived the next week.  A week later, the owner followed up with me to make sure that I received the part. Mind you, this service is for an inexpensive product that he probably made only a few dollars on after sending me a new part.  This is a business owner who obviously cares about his product and his customers. I hope he has much success with his company; he deserves it.</li>
    <li> Works good for what it is.  It has to be placed under the water to work and so sometimes gets watermarks (spots) on it  But it does the job better than any others that we have used</li>
    <li> Works great, stays clear, hook holds the mirror nice. Could be a little bigger but works great. Would recomend. Nice.</li>
    <li> When I got it I instantly noticed how relatively small it is. So before you order, make sure you look at the size in the description. When I first used it I was terribly disappointed as it does fog up. Then three days after receiving it, I get an email with a list of instructions on how to use a friggin mirror so it doesn&#x27;t fog up. The instructions should&#x27;ve been in the box with the mirror, but lets face it no man reads the instructions anyway. Is it fog free? No, it is not. It&#x27;s just a mirror. Only thing is, they teach you a common sense trick to warm up a mirror with the hot water before using it, and try not to breathe on it. Same thing I was doing with the other mirror I had. So if you already have a nifty little mirror, don&#x27;t waste your money on this one. And another thing. It comes with a hook, which should be noted clearly as I spent money buying an additional pack of hooks in case it wasn&#x27;t included. Wasted more money. There should be a label on the images saying &amp;#34;hook included&amp;#34; or a more visible noting in the description saying that theres a hook in it. I shouldn&#x27;t have bought this thing.</li>
    <li> I love the size and how easy to stick to wall in my shower. I Know its advertise as fogless which is not but its not big to me.</li>
    <li> you can tell by their instructions book that they really want you have enjoy their product and do it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for making sure we do it right! thanks for including a wipey with alcohol too, I did not have any handy in the house to use per your instructions.. so i was glad you included the wipey.... your instructions made no mention of the wipey by the way, which leads me to believe you recently started adding it in based off customer reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 12/22/2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After more than half a year of daily use, this mirror looks like new when I scrub off the minerals using regualr body wash soap and a body scrubber.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay &amp;#34;fog free&amp;#34; for very long. I frequently have to re-wet it to get rid of the fog. On top of that, this mirror actually has a de-magnifying effect, so your face actually appears smaller in this mirror than it would in a regular mirror. I definitely would NOT recommend this mirror if you&#x27;re planning to use it for shaving, plucking, eyebrow trimming, or any sort of grooming really. If you&#x27;re just using it to wash your face, you&#x27;re probably okay, but I think you&#x27;d be better off spending a few dollars more for a quality shower mirror as opposed to this one.</li>
    <li> All I expected and more.</li>
    <li> Nice shaving mirror for the shower</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror because it is supposed to be &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34;.. This is completely untrue. As soon as you step in and turn the shower on you can no longer see. I bought it for my boyfriend so he can do his shaving in the shower and he is constantly having to wipe the fog off or place the mirror under the water every two seconds. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Easy to clean.  Most helpful for shaving in the shower.  My grandson really likes this little fog free mirror.</li>
    <li> Pretty good product, love being able to shave in the shower, and it gives me the ability to do that! One reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because though it is &amp;#34;fog free&amp;#34; that&#x27;s only because if you hold it under the water until it is warm enough it stays fog free for a minute or two, then you have to put it under again. But it is a really good product for relatively cheap!</li>
    <li> this works exactly as described and i use it quite regularly. this beats shaving over the sink 10 fold. buy this mirror.</li>
    <li> This mirror fogs up in a warm shower. If you run it under water the fog goes away, but then the mirror is covered in water drops. On the plus side it won&#x27;t break if you drop it and it is a nice size.</li>
    <li> got this for my husband so he would stop asking me after shaving in the shower if he missed any spots(which he always did).  debated about buying more of an expensive, fancy one.  this is perfect in every way.</li>
    <li> so expensive for such a tiny mirror</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror due to my wife griping about me stealing hers to use in the shower. I specifically wanted a &amp;#34;fog&amp;#34; free due to me liking to take steam showers. This mirror is in my opinion average at best. It is very small and and pretty ineffective. The mounting hook is probably the best working part of this duo. I usually have to set it by the drain and leave it there while I wash up and then when I am done with everything then I shave. I have to rinse it several times in the process to keep it from fogging up. Not one of the better products that I have purchased from amazon. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Still fogs up every once in a while, but works well!</li>
    <li> Follow the instructions and be happy with your purchase! If you do it right: dont place the mirror to high so its about the same temperature as the shower, run the warm water on it before the shower for a quick second or two, then it should work perfectly. It is rather small, a little bigger than a grown man&#x27;s hands, but it does the job.  UPDATE (7/14/15): I moved so I had to take off the hook and adhesive and unfortunately it was not usable, the mirror was still fine. I emailed The Cumberland Companies LLC (the seller) about a possible replacement, not expecting much, and within NO JOKE 4 MINUTES, they replied asking for my address to send a replacement. That customer service is ridiculously good. Would definitely recommend. Besides, it&#x27;s a great product</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally take the time leave reviews. In fact, I think this may be the first time I&#x27;ve ever written one on Amazon, but I feel like the world should know about how amazing ShaveWell is as a company and about how awesome this little mirror is. Its a simple design but it works, and it works well. I hate shaving, but after ordering this mirror I started doing it in the shower and it has become a much more pleasent experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two years of owning this mirror the hook that it came with finally gave way. For $10 I couldn&#x27;t be upset even if I tried. It worked so well for so long and even this was a minor issue, but I decided to email them about it, partly because of the e-mail I recieved from the company when I just purchased the product which said that I should feel free to contact them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had asked if there was a way to order the 50 cent hook without paying the 2.99 shipping charge. I recieved a response from Bill in under TEN minutes. No joke. Not only did I recieve a reply that quick but Bill said that if I send him my address they would send a new hook at no charge to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As many people have mentioned in their reviews, this is a company that stands by their product and their customers. I have recomended this mirror to everyone I know!</li>
    <li> works well, but isn&#x27;t as clear as I was hoping...but works adequately.</li>
    <li> Good shower mirror.  Compact and durable as well. I use this when i go out to the field in the Army so its multi use.</li>
    <li> I use the mirror daily and like the ability to grab the mirror off the wall to see where I am shaving.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a race to get your face shaved before things get foggy! Works well enough though, and having to run it under the water again once or twice mid-shave isn&#x27;t too much of a hassles, especially at this price. I&#x27;m not rushing to return it or anything, but I would say splurge the extra $10 on one of the mirrors where you fill a reservoir with water. Those guys stay fog free forever</li>
    <li> Works well but I always have to reheat the mirror to get it to clear the fog. I guess that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
    <li> Not a whole lot to say here.  It works.  Hold it under hot water.....hang it up....shave.  Pretty easy stuff really.</li>
    <li> The Shave Well Company a TRULY FOG FREE Shower Shave Mirror. Truly fogless by design. Will not fall off of the wall. - I was surprised at how small it was.</li>
    <li> I had a minor problem with the shaving mirror and can not say enough about on how my concerns were handled. The only thing I can say about this company&#x27;s customer service skills and commitment to their product is WOW. The VP resolved my concerns 120% and I would encourage anyone to try their product.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Mirror is lightweight and clear once the film protection is removed. It comes with a stick on shower hook so you don&#x27;t need to buy one.  Every mirror I have ever used fogs due to temp differences and moisture, this one stays fog free once you rinse it under hot water for a while.  Hell, I have to rinse my razor under the water multiple times, so I really don&#x27;t mind rinsing the mirror once or twice during my shave.  Water droplets can be cured by rubbing the mirror with a little toothpaste (just like diving masks) and it helps with some fogging.  The company stands by their product and has emailed me twice to check on me and see if I was satisfied with it.  Good customer service in my opinion.  Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Works exactly as the description says, even when taking very hot showers. I will highly recommend this to friends and family.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for about a month now.  Works as advertised and as long as you warm up both the front and back of the mirror, it stays fog free.  Very satisfied with that part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that stops me from giving it five stars is that I wish that it came with a suction cup to stick it to the shower wall rather than the adhesive hook.  I use this as a travel mirror, and it would have been more convenient for me to be able to move it from shower to shower (or even change location within the shower).</li>
    <li> Does what it should very well. Would be nice if it came with a sleeve of some sort so when you pack it for travel it doesn&#x27;t get scratched.</li>
    <li> Okay-but did not last long.</li>
    <li> This mirror makes shaving far more convenient. It&#x27;s also very easy to hang. Cumberland Companies actually sent us a replacement hook, free of charge, when we left our last one behind in a move. (I&#x27;d say the one downfall is how difficult it is to remove the adhesive once it&#x27;s stuck on. But that means it&#x27;s doing its job!) Cool company, simple product, recommended.</li>
    <li> I guess every mirror manufacture in the world can say their mirrors are &amp;#34;TRULY FOG FREE&amp;#34; as long as they include instructions with the mirrors that say to heat up both sides with hot water before use.. There is NOTHING special done to this mirror or that comes with it to keep it from fogging up in a warm shower. NOTHING! I do find it useful hanging from one of my shower curtain rings. But just think it&#x27;s crazy what they can advertize these days</li>
    <li> I used it for a while, but the shower was too cold for me to shave in.</li>
    <li> Great simple fog free mirror. It does what it is advertised to do. Simply warm it up a bit and it will remain fog free. If it fogs up again simply run it under the water again.</li>
    <li> Pretty simple. It&#x27;s a non-glass mirror that comes with a hanger similar to a Command Strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this for the size and because it&#x27;s not glass. I like to hold the mirror when I shave (I like to live on the edge) so when I inevitably drop it on the shower floor it won&#x27;t shatter.</li>
    <li> It works great, but the silver coating on the back started rubbing off.  This hasn&#x27;t affected the quality of the mirror, it&#x27;s just good to know.  Keep in mind this mirror is about 1-1.5 years old.  I have dropped it numerous times, and it has never cracked, fractured, or anything.</li>
    <li> Mine started to peel after 6 months.  It fogs up pretty quickly.  A tip- rub toothpaste on the surface while in the shower- it will keep it fog free for about 90 seconds, or just long enough to shave.  1+ years and the sticky hook hasn&#x27;t fallen off yet, which is the most impressive thing about this item.</li>
    <li> works as advertized.......a great mirror for inside the shower</li>
    <li> Actually, I shave immediately after showering and keep this stuck to the mirror above the sink. It works wonderfully. I just run some hot water over it while whipping up my shaving soap and it stays fog free the entire duration of my shave with a safety razor - three passes at a leisurely pace - while the large mirror on which it is stuck is unusable. Light and tough too. Great product!</li>
    <li> Works like they say just follow the directions and rinse in hot water and it is truly fog free shaving experience</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a big, light-up mirror that kept falling off the shower wall (bad suction cups).  This was a fraction of the cost and works great.  An added benefit is that you can take the mirror off the hook to clean behind it and/or use it outside the shower.  In this case, simpler was better.</li>
    <li> Mirror still fogs up even though I followed the directions.  Very poor quality.</li>
    <li> it is a normal mirror. you have to keep on pour water on the mirror to see you face. waste of money.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this product for about 3 months now and he absolutely loves it. We did have an issue with the adhesive in the beginning but it sticks now. Just follow directions and enjoy.</li>
    <li> This mirror does what it says, it reflects light...like most mirrors. I do need to add a bit of soap to the front to keep the surface tension of the water down to keep the moisture in the shower from beading up on the front surface. Biggest complaint is the sputtered silvered coating (assuming Aluminum) on the back has some type of plastic/epoxy coating behind it to protect it. That protective coating doesn&#x27;t like either repeated moist/dry or hot/cold cycles and started flaking off after 3-4 months in the shower. Once the protective coating is off, the aluminum follows quickly after. I&#x27;m guessing I have about 6-8months left before it&#x27;ll be unusable so I&#x27;ll be shopping for a more protected alternative soon.</li>
    <li> It works, but its super small and feels junky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it works and its cheap so whatever just get it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to own a real big fancy one with lights and stuff, but it stopped working within a week and it fell off on my feet a few weeks ago.  Trashed that one and got this, it works.</li>
    <li> I had a problem installing the hook (entirely my fault) wrote to company to get new hook.  I received excellent customer service, emails letting me know of progress of the new hook and then follow up emails to make sure I was happy (all this for a new hook)!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only all products and especially sellers on Amazon were this good....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish there was a rating greater than 5 stars.....</li>
    <li> The mirror instantly fogged up when I started using it. It&#x27;s definition of &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; is for you to hold the mirror in the hot water and warm it up to keep it from fogging. That&#x27;s literally what it says on the packaging. Every mirror technically works the same way.&lt;br /&gt;If you want a mirror that is small and hangs in your shower then this works, but it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
    <li> All I can say is that if you purchase this item you will quickly come to hate it. It dangles from a hook so its always moving some, makes you feel like your on a ship. Also it does not stay fog free long enough (after you run it under the hot shower stream) to even complete shaving. Its price may seem low but its hassle factor is way to high. You are going to hate it.  I do!</li>
    <li> Lasts for a long time. Needs to be scrubbed on occasion but pretty much care free! Shaving in the shower saves a ton of time.</li>
    <li> This mirror does the job it is supposed to do perfectly. The company emailed me with detailed instructions for correct use, I followed them, and viola, a fantastic fog-free-shower-shave experience every morning. My only recommendation would be to get a Command hook to hang it on rather than the one they give.</li>
    <li> This mirror is a must have if you need a fog free mirror in the bathroom. It works great, and when it does fog up, just run it under water and its clear again for quite some time. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> It was a bit smaller than I had expected. I also put to silicon pads on the back to prevent movement. But it is an excellent product. Very little to no fogging even without holding it under hot water. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Make sure you read the dimensions because this mirror is very small... however that really doesn&#x27;t take much away from it.  This Fogless Mirror works exactly as it says it does - just warm the mirror under the water and it wont fog up on you.  Plus it may come in handy to have a mirror you can remove from the wall if needed, without unhooking anything or popping off suction cups.  The Hook provided has a ready to use glue strip attached.  So far it remains tightly secured to the tile.  **UPDATE**  This mirror has hung in my shower, without a single problem, for almost 3 years.  My bath gets a lot of use (5-6 people sharing 1 shower).    When I mounted the hook for the mirror I properly prepped the tile by washing and drying completely.  The hook has never budged from it&#x27;s secure position.    The mirror is still great!  I will admit I have dropped it in the shower several times.  Not a scratch on it!</li>
    <li> Overall fairly happy with this. It is a bit small and hard to see in, and, while it works like the manufacturer says, it doesn&#x27;t stay clear very long (although this may be because I have a bad draft in my shower). Ultimately, having looked at a number of these mirrors on the site, I&#x27;m not entirely sure that you&#x27;d be able to find something better. Most seem more complicated without much benefit. If you are just looking for an easy to use mirror that works (most of the time) would recommend this. If you don&#x27;t mind the extra hassle of the ones that make you put water in a reservoir or some other shenanigans, then go that route.</li>
    <li> boyfriend likes it :)</li>
    <li> Just as described.  Hold it under the water for a few seconds, hang it back up, and away you go.  It won&#x27;t fog, but of course it will still be wet, but it&#x27;s easy enough to see for shaving.  It gets hard water stains over time, but I&#x27;ve found a tiny amount of toothpaste every month or so helps keep it clear.</li>
    <li> I picked up this mirror because I wanted to start shaving in the shower - I&#x27;ve always shaved over the sink after showering, and I wasn&#x27;t all too pleased with the results. After shopping around and checking out the competition, I decided to go with this one, because the price was very reasonable and people had good things to say about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the mirror arrived, it was about as simple as I expected for the price I paid - a rounded rectangular mirror with a grey plastic-like back and a small hook to hang it with. Its appearance is certain not what I would call &#x27;impressive&#x27;, but a shower mirror is less about form and more about function, so I can&#x27;t knock it for its simplicity. I wanted something that would be unobtrusive in my shower, and this mirror fits the bill just fine. The adhesive on the hook holds up great - even after a bit of tugging on it to test it out, it&#x27;s pretty sturdy, certainly more than enough to support the mirror which is actually very lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror&#x27;s ability to reduce fogginess is dependent on the mirror itself getting up to the temperature of your water, which is done by simply putting the grey side of the mirror underneath your shower head for a few seconds. As advertised, my mirror was fogless and shaving was a breeze. I&#x27;ve seen some mirrors that allow you to fill a reservoir with water to keep the mirror fogless for longer, but unless you take hour-long showers, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s really necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I definitely feel like I got my money out of my purchase, so I absolutely recommend picking this up if you&#x27;re looking for a simple, effective shower mirror.</li>
    <li> This mirror works exactly as stated. Hold it under the water a few seconds and it is fog free. Note that if you hold onto it or it&#x27;s near the edge of the shower curtain and getting blasted with the colder air, it may fog a bit. It comes with a nifty hook and mounting square that, despite the humidity in the shower, has shown no sign of coming unattached. Note that it is pretty small so depending on preference, you may want something bigger. I&#x27;ve found it to be perfect for shaving in the shower!</li>
    <li> Great mirror. I have had it for a few years now and still looks new. No wayer stains and still works as new. Doesn&#x27;t fog up. Great purchase. Decide to write a review yrs later as proof.</li>
    <li> this mirror works like it says. the sticky part wore off after a month. its still good to use in the shower because it&#x27;s light, it isn&#x27;t breakable, and it doesn&#x27;t fog.</li>
    <li> Never shaved in the shower before and it was always a painful production, can&#x27;t believe I never got this mirror before now. clean up is a breeze, and painless. I actually look forward to shaving now!</li>
    <li> This mirror is in no way fogless. In fact I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a high-fog mirror. Whatever technology they employ by having you heat the surface in hot water doesn&#x27;t work and I constantly have to wipe the mirror with my hand to see anything. Also the little sticky thing they give you to attach it to the wall lasted for maybe 1.5 showers before completely falling off. Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Still fogs but best one I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
    <li> Truly Fog Free?!? This mirror is useless! It does indeed fog up even after &amp;#34;warming&amp;#34; it up as the directions say prior to use. It is also tiny! It does not say in the description but it does come with a hook to hang it with so no other hook is required to purchase like I did. I would not buy this and would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ALOT smaller than what I thought I bought if for my brother as he&#x27;s learning to shave and I just don&#x27;t see how you can see in such a small mirror in the shower to shave.</li>
    <li> Just follow the directions and it works well. It is rather small, but I could have ordered the larger version  if that is what I wanted. Hubbie is pleased with it and it was a great value.</li>
    <li> the product works well and is easily installed.  it looks a little cheap but works well and was cheaper than other options.</li>
    <li> Works! Stays fogless in the shower! Just wish there was a way to keep it dry now. Not bad for $10.</li>
    <li> Holy crap this thing is amazing!  I use it daily and have no idea how I lived without it!  Shaving in the shower is so much more relaxing.  Thanks for such great instructions on how to use it.</li>
    <li> Works great, just follow the simple directions. Use it all the time.</li>
    <li> Not a perfect product, but works okay for in shower shaving. Much smaller than I anticipated.  Even though the mirror is not fogged, there are droplets of water everywhere that make it difficult to see.</li>
    <li> Truly fog free if you warm it up. I often shave with shampoo and when I lather up I&#x27;ll just rub a little soap on the mirror, makes it even fog free-ier.</li>
    <li> After about 7 months of use in shower at the beach, reflective back started coming off.</li>
    <li> I have to say that this isn&#x27;t completely fog free, but it does the job.  I doubt any shower mirror is completely fog free.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good sized and portable. Three months later and the hook is still on the wall. It works for me. But I note that if the shaving ends some 6-7 minutes after the warm bath begins, there is some fog on the mirror. Not enough to block the shaving, but not fogless at all. That&#x27;s why I give one star less.&lt;br /&gt;Overall it worths the price. I cannot say that a most expensive mirror would be perfect?</li>
    <li> Great product, fast ship.  *****</li>
    <li> This fog-free mirror works if you run it under the water and towel it off when you get in the shower.  That&#x27;s essential that you take that step, or it doesn&#x27;t work.  The instructions tell you the same.  Clean-shaved since I bought it.</li>
    <li> Very small but husband said it&#x27;ll do</li>
    <li> Husband loves it.  Works great.  I even use the mirror in the shower.  Thanks. No fog problems. Thank you, thank you, thank you.</li>
    <li> The product was ok. I would have preferred a larger mirror. The only use it has is for traveling. That is all that I can recomend it for.</li>
    <li> just what I was looking for and needed!I was using my buddy&#x27;s girlfriends electric make-up mirror in the shower&amp;had to give it back every time,all wet,so I said let me go to Amazon&amp;see what they got for cheap&amp;viola&#x27;here&#x27;s what I got&amp;what they had!</li>
    <li> This product had a lot fo positive reviews so I tried it out. Its a very small mirror so it can be a bit tricky to get a good view unless perfectly placed within close range. It comes with a nifty hanger but once you place it, it&#x27;s there for good. The main selling point with this mirror is that it is &amp;#34;fog free&amp;#34;. The instructions advise to let the hot water wash over it for a couple minutes before using. even after doing this the mirror still fogs. Because the mirror is so small I have to get very close to it to properly shave so I can&#x27;t help but fog it up. even if I don&#x27;t get too close it still seems to start fogging up. Maybe most people shave much faster but using a straight razor requires more care so maybe that could be the cause. Either way it definitely does not seem to be &amp;#34;fog free&amp;#34; but it comes close enough I suppose. If there were a larger version it would be much more recommendable.</li>
    <li> This mirror comes with a hook, but it&#x27;s one of those really cheap plastic decal hooks that I don&#x27;t really want leaving a mark on my shower wall. There is a hole in the top of the mirror so I just threaded a piece of twine through it to hang it on my scrubbie hook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to run this mirror under the water to heat it up, of course, before it actually works, but it is just kind of lame. I thought it would be an actual glass mirror, (I should have been paying more attention) but it is plastic with a gray finish on the back that started peeling from day one. It looks like something from the dollar store, which is really disappointing for the ridiculous price. It works, but gets really streaky and spotty, and the water doesn&#x27;t bead like the company advertised it would. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the original complaint is still visible or not, but this change of opinion has been long overdue. When originally delivered, the mirror worked as described, but the adhesive with which it used to hang didn&#x27;t work as promised. In less than a day the mirror could no longer hang. At the time I posted a review revealing this issue, and my disappointment with the product. Not even a day later, the owner contacted me with information to rectify the issue, including sending replacement adhesives at no cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They arrived a day later, worked as promised, and I have been happy ever since. The mirror is great for up-close, fog-free, in-shower shaves, but almost more importantly, the responsibility shown by the company in ensuring I was satisfied with my purchase was as top-notch as you can find in today&#x27;s day of customer service wait times, and mass-produced empty promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommend.</li>
    <li> Buy only if you want to have fog in a tiny mirror. Be careful with all 5 star reviews.</li>
    <li> Cheep product. All the backing is flaking off already (~3weeks in the shower). Save your money, and buy a nicer one.</li>
    <li> It is fog-free (after you rinse it), but the mirror&#x27;s back is already peeling</li>
    <li> A little small but my husband makes great use out of, rarely misses a spot when shaving.</li>
    <li> Hook is sturdy, mirror is real nice. However the mirror still fogs up but running water over it a couple times fixes it right away. Pretty good product over all</li>
    <li> For those of us who prefer to shave or wash our face while showering, this shower mirror is a semi-decent product at this price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s simple to set up, and after three years of near-daily use, it&#x27;s held up very well. (Their claim that it &amp;#34;never falls&amp;#34; is, in my experience, accurate.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have to point out that it is anything BUT fog free. (Pls see attached photos.) It&#x27;s not even close. Although there is a decent fix for the fog problem. Whenever the mirror fogs up, just rinse it under the hot shower water for a few seconds and it&#x27;ll be fog free for the next 90-120 seconds. (I end up doing that between 3-6 times per shower.) Also, if you are careful to avoid breathing directly into the mirror, it greatly reduces the level of fogging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, you get what you pay for, and this is an acceptable product at this price point.</li>
    <li> Not only does this product actually work very well (if you do as they suggest and hold it under the water for 5 seconds or so), but the support is outstanding. I had a moment of stupidity when trying to put mine up (while also doing 12 other things) and hung it the way it had arrived in the packaging - which was upside down. Even though a bathroom remodel caused me to not even try the product for MONTHS after it arrived, when I did this and emailed support, they responded quickly, and even were willing to send out another hook with instructions. And going even further above &amp; beyond, they followed up with another email a few days later to make sure it had worked okay. Great experience.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ll start off by saying the mirror definitely works. It&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve had a mirror to shave with in the shower because every one of them would fog up after the first few uses. I typically take twenty minutes to shower and shave. I ran both sides under the warm water (to me the water seems warm compared to my wife who showers like she&#x27;s cooking a lobster) at the beginning of my shower and about half way through it just barely started fogging on the edge. I didn&#x27;t need it yet anyway, I just wanted to see how long it would last. I repeated the water on both sides and shaved without any problems. The size worked for me and framed my face well. I was tempted to get the larger version, but I wouldn&#x27;t return it now just for the bigger size. Also it appears to be made out of plastic. Not a problem as it would suck to drop a piece of glass in the shower. But I would treat it like a pair of sunglasses and clean it with a micro-fiber cloth made for eye wear to keep it from scratching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple and effective. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> My husband had been looking for a mirror for a long time. I found this for him and he loves it. The only thing id that after a while the piece that it hangs on came loose. We fixed it by a suction cup with a hook for it to hang on for the shower. Other then that it has been great.</li>
    <li> If you read the directions this mirror will work perfectly for you. Just be smart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions specify that you should run the mirror under warm water to keep it from fogging up. Anyone who is having fog trouble should read the directions.</li>
    <li> This mirror does exactly as it is advertised to do.  Suction cup is very strong and has not fallen off yet.</li>
    <li> slightly gimmicky, but good price and it works well enough. &amp;#34;fog free&amp;#34; lasts for 30 seconds before you have to &amp;#34;recharge&amp;#34; it in the hot shower water</li>
    <li> Still using this.  No major scratches and works as expected and is easy to hold.</li>
    <li> Fog free...hmmm, not so much, but it works well enough for me to shave in the shower, which gives me a smoother easier shave, I bought a second to use when I travel.</li>
    <li> This is one fantastic product, TRULY FOG FREE in capitals because they&#x27;re not lying the mirror works exactly the way it should!</li>
    <li> Not really a &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; fogless mirror, but it does ok.</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a fogless mirror - with some work. You have to run it under hot water to warm it up, so that condensation doesn&#x27;t form on it. I&#x27;ve had other fogless mirrors with which you don&#x27;t have to do this. And it helps to rub a little shampoo on it, which gets rid of the hundreds of water droplets on it, and makes it fogless for more than 1 shower.&lt;br /&gt;In spite of its inconveniences, I DO like the fact that it hangs off a hook, so it&#x27;s easily taken down and put back up. At the beginning of my shower, I just take it off the hook and let it sit on the tub floor around my feet while the hot water drains over it.</li>
    <li> Use this thing every day. It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror although I should have bought the larger size one. You must FOLLOW the instructions for it to work right, it&#x27;s simple science anyway, temperature differential. ☺</li>
    <li> Still works great a year later</li>
    <li> Not recommended with hard water</li>
    <li> Packaged as expected.  It&#x27;s a plastic mirror and feels sturdy so I hope it doesn&#x27;t break if dropped/shattered.  It&#x27;s the perfect size to reflect my head and comes with a little sticky-backed hook to hang it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A suggestion I would make:  I&#x27;ve owned a different brand/type before and have some pretty heavy minerals in my water.  This other one has slowly gotten &amp;#34;water spots&amp;#34; on it and just doesn&#x27;t reflect as good as it used to.  With this one, I&#x27;m going to attempt to keep it clean/dry after getting out of the shower every time to avoid that long term build-up.  Then again this one may not have the same problem.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot, but you have to keep running hot water on it every 2 minutes to keep it fog free.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and works great, I enjoy the small size as I can hold it when shaving. Move the mirror instead of adjusting my face and neck. I like shaving in the shower - this makes it easier.</li>
    <li> The product performs as written but the fog-free part involves warming the mirror in the shower stream. You can buy a plastic locker mirror  and a self -sticking hook for less money at  any  drugstore or big box store.</li>
    <li> This product works as stated.  Nothing complicated, just wet with warm water and you have a fog-free surface.  Sometimes low-tech is best.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. What more could I ask for. Small enough to easly hold and big enough to get the job done, Run under warm water during shower to warm mirror and it is fog free. The clip worked great for mounting to the wall.</li>
    <li> This product is great!  It works very well. When we did have a problem with the mirror discoloring, a replacement was sent to us immediately!  Would definitely buy a product from this company again.</li>
    <li> HAHAH this truly works.  I shave every morning in the shower, and now with this mirror I never have to worry about seeing to shave.  It really is as good as it makes itself out to be.</li>
    <li> This item was inexpensive, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but it really wasn&#x27;t even worth what I paid. The stickum on the holder gave out within 3 weeks, but we just hung it on a suction cup holder instead. But now after only a few months use, about 1/2 inch around all the edges the mirror has worn away with big grey splotches in it&#x27;s place. It is relatively fog free after being run under hot water for a few seconds, but it is cheap.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a gift, so can&#x27;t tell you how it works. It is rather small but shouldn&#x27;t take up much space in small shower stall.</li>
    <li> An inexpensive, elegant solution to an old problem.  It works great! Just be sure and follow the instructions.  There is a larger one made by the same company for sale on Amazon, you might want to consider that one.</li>
    <li> unlike many other mirrors i have tried, this actually does not fog and presents a very clear useable image.  would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> The mirror itself is great. It works fine and allows me to see in the shower fog free for a good deal of time. I am able to get a nice shave using this product. I am able to have it fog free for about 10-15 minutes before I would need to reheat it under running water, this is plenty of time for shave everything I need. Please note that water droplets will bead on this mirror, so you will not get a perfectly clean reflective mirror, this is really not a bother for me though. The mirror is also very sensitive to changes in temperatures. If you turn the water temp slightly up or down the mirror will start fogging again. The mirror itself is really light weight and easy to hold in the shower. It is made from acrylic and not glass, as noted in some other reviews, so it will not break from falls. I have had mine fall twice now, and the mirror is unharmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is the hook. It won&#x27;t stay up in my shower for more than 24 hours. I cleaned the surface, I then dried the surface, I then applied the hook with the adhesive exposed and applied pressure for 20 seconds. I did this twice and both times it fell off shortly after my shower. I am applying it to a smooth tile surface, got on the grout or anything. I am trying to find some other adhesive I can attach to the hook to have it stay up in my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think a product is only as good as its worst part, and the hook is the worst part of this product. If my mirror can&#x27;t stay up, I cannot give this product a good rating. If the hook is not needed for you or you can find a workaround easily, then this is a fantastic product that I would recommend for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: The company contacted me today morning right before I submitted this review, to ask about any questions or concerns regarding this product. I explained the issue to them and responded promptly within an hour. They seem to have amazing customer service. They are sending me a new hook right away and explained to me to clean the tile surface and let it dry completely then apply the hook and let it set for 24 hours before hanging the mirror. I will try this with the new hook and will update my review again with anything new. For now I will keep my 3 star rating, but can change it depending on the service and help I receive from the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2: The company sent me a replacement hook, an additional suction cup (which was not included in the original package), and some helpful tips. This is what they told me to do: \\&quot;When the new hook arrives, once you have cleaned the area you plan to stick the mirror, please allow enough time for this area to completely dry (remember tile is porous and will absorb moisture from your cleaning solution).  For best results, let the adhesive \\&quot;set\\&quot; for 24 hours before hanging the mirror on the hook.\\&quot; It is a little bit of extra effort to make sure the tile is completely dry and the hook is set for a whole 24 hours before hanging the mirror, but it really does help. I cleaned my tile with tile cleaner, as I had done previously, and let it dry for about 30 to 60 minutes, I then press the hook adhesive to the tile for 20 seconds and let it \\&quot;set\\&quot; for 20 hours before hanging a mirror on it. So far it has been up for 3 days without falling off. If it does fall off again I will update my review with how long it stayed up. To be honest though I prefer the suction cup they sent me to hang my mirror. It is easier to install, stays up just as well as the hook (if not better), and can be repositioned anytime you need. I wish it were included in the original package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have raised my review to 5 stars because I am now satisfied with the product. The hook may still not be perfect; it takes more effort than expected to attach to your tile, and can&#x27;t be repositioned. But the customer service I received for a $10 product has been out of this world. It seems to me that they are 100% committed to make your product meet your needs. This service is far more of a positive than any negative of the hook.ositive than any negative of the hook.</li>
    <li> I searched around for a shaving mirror and this was a great choice.  The best I found.  The price, quality, and functionality cannot be beat.  I am very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Works well.  It&#x27;s small.  My one criticism is that the edges seem a bit sharp if they catch your skin the wrong way.  I was planning to give this to my 7 year old to help him check that he&#x27;s gotten all the shampoo out of his hair in the bath, but I was worried about him cutting himself on an edge.  Gave it to my husband instead and he likes it fine.</li>
    <li> Great product! Please take the time to read about the place in US where the item was made! Thank you Sunshine Industries! To all the negative feed-backers - please read the instructions for use, before leaving a negative feedback.</li>
    <li> DEC 2014 UPDATE...  This mirror has been hanging around in my shower for over two years now, and I can honestly say that it works as well now as the day I bought it. Solid product. Buy one!    ORIGINAL REVIEW FROM NOV 2012...  I bought this mirror because I&#x27;ve always found it easier to shave while still in the shower rather than waiting till I&#x27;m out and doing it over the sink. I have gone through several mirrors over the past 20 years and have never found one as simple and effective as this one. It&#x27;s lightweight, truly fog-free, and since it&#x27;s not made of glass it won&#x27;t break like my past ones. Thanks for making an excellent product!    I am also very impressed with this company&#x27;s integrity in standing by its products. If you look at the \\&quot;comments\\&quot; section of any negative reviews, you will notice that a company representative has PERSONALLY responded to each customer complaint and offered full refunds AND replacement products to ensure full satisfaction. This is a rare find in companies today (unfortunately), and I applaud the management.</li>
    <li> This is the only shaving mirror that has ever worked for me. Ever! Having a mirror that comes off the wall to heat up under the shower stream is genius. Wish I&#x27;d thought of it!</li>
    <li> Its Simple and it works - Nothing fancy and a good price - Just what I asked for - four stars</li>
    <li> It does fog up, but washes away easily.... my only complaint is that you have to wash it every 5-10 minutes in the shower. installation was a breeze</li>
    <li> This mirror is good its still in my shower a year later, i have nothing negative to add, its a mirror it fogs up a little but its good, it comes with a little hook that you peel the back and stick to your desired location, and the mirror hangs from it, i actually use it to shave and i actually hold it in my hand.</li>
    <li> This is made of plastic so it is light weight.  Works well after both sides are warmed with shower water.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this mirror in 2011 for my husband and within just a few months the backing began chipping off. When I left feedback regarding this problem, a representative from the company contacted me and even sent another mirror due to the chipping problem. The gentleman kept in contact with me to see if the new one was working for us. Unfortunately it did begin chipping again, but we found through communicating with him that it was because of the salt in our water from our water softener. The manufacturer is working on resolving this problem. In the meantime, we will continue to use this mirror and purchase again if we have to because it is such a great lightweight design that is truly fog-free if you follow instructions. So great for travel as well. We want to support such a fine customer-oriented company that stands behind its products. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Great price . Smaller than I expected, but I&#x27;m sure will do the job. I Have not used just yet.</li>
    <li> performs just as advertised, like the hole to hang it anywhere you want to. Just keep it warm and it works like magic</li>
    <li> Believe it or not, this is the first fog-free shower shave mirror I&#x27;ve used. Well, that&#x27;s not totally true. It&#x27;s not that this never fogs - it&#x27;s just incredibly easy to prevent the fog from showing up for a long time, and to eliminate it if it does show up. Just run the mirror under the shower water for a few seconds, and you&#x27;re good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also a great size. I know they make a larger version if you so desire, but I find that I end up getting so close to the mirror to see what I&#x27;m shaving that a bigger mirror surface would be wasted. Plus, this mirror is small enough to toss in my toiletries bag when I have to travel. Perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, this is also the mirror with the most easily prevented water spots. The instructions that came with the mirror suggest using toothpaste to remove water spots. I disagree. That might work, but I&#x27;ve never had to try. Instead, I suggest preventing the water spots from showing up in the first place. It&#x27;s really easy to do. Just dry the mirrored surface off with your towel after you shower, then hang it back up backwards (mirrored side facing the wall). Next time you need to shave, you&#x27;ll have to take the mirror off the hook to run it under the water anyway, so just flip it back around at that point. In the meantime, it doesn&#x27;t collect water spots!</li>
    <li> First one I&#x27;ve purchased that actually does what it says it will do.  You do have to run it under hot water when you begin your shower for it to work properly.  After I did that, it worked as promised.  Great product, excellent value.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this mirror for the past five months and so far i have been really happy with it. All you have to do is run it under the shower for a few seconds to prevent fogging. A lot of times it fogs up halfway through my shave, but i just run it under the shower again an it clears up. Basically, this is a simple and low cost solution to shaving in the shower.</li>
    <li> This shower mirror does what it is supposed to: provide a good reflected image while staying fog free. I liked it enough, I bought a second one to take along when I travel.</li>
    <li> I was actually kind of surprised at how well this worked. It didn&#x27;t fog up at all. If you want something for the shower, this is a good buy.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror as a Christmas present for my son, and he has told me that it works great.  I had bought him one from Amazom.com 15 years ago, so it was time for a new one.  He says that he doesn&#x27;t have to keep wiping it off - it really repels the fog.  And it sticks to his shower wall...that is a biggy.  All in all, this is the mirror to buy if you want a truly fog-free miror so that you can shave in the shower.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I am traveling for the next year and needed a smaller shower mirror compared to the one I have back home. I ended up going with this product and to my disappointment it still fogs despite following all the included instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However it is a nice mirror if you don&#x27;t mind passing your hand over it every once in a while to remove the fog. I recommend paying a little bit extra and getting a truly fog free mirror.</li>
    <li> Handy enough to use, but takes a few seconds to preheat. Problem is that if the mirror rests against a tile wall it soon gets cold again and fogs up.  I would suggest a material coating which resists water instead of relying on temperature differential, because even drops of water or shaving cream seem to stick to it, whether hot or cold.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again unless that change were made AND my shower stall wasn&#x27;t lined with tile or marble.</li>
    <li> I needed a fog free mirror to use while showering so I bought this based on the reviews. The mirror is very simple, it comes with a plastic hook to hang in the shower. There is no treatment of the mirror that makes it fog free so you have to put it under hot water and then use it and repeat as necessary. You can do that with any mirror. So, does it works...yes for a minute.</li>
    <li> Probably great for traveling,  but much too small for daily use.</li>
    <li> gets really foggy easily, not useful when its foggy. didnt want to attach it with the hook it came with, i thought it might ruin my apartment shower.</li>
    <li> Although I reviewed the measurements I was slightly disappointed in the size when it arrived.  It will still work for in our trailer which is why we bought it. Like the other product we got of this so am sure we will enjoy this.</li>
    <li> Does what it says.  Stays fog free for quite a while before you have to warm it up again.  Works well.</li>
    <li> Works as described - I have to run a little glass cleaner on it every once in a while to make sure the reflection is good (we have hard water), but otherwise its a great product.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this! Mirror really works and is fog free.  He likes this so much, I am ordering more.</li>
    <li> Not really fog-free in my shower (the wall is too cold) but it&#x27;s good enough. One, sometimes two, additional rinses in hot water is enough to keep it going. I haven&#x27;t tried a chemical treatment to see if that would help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having it mount on a hook and the light weight are big pluses. No more suction cup mounted mirror popping off the wall, clattering on the tub, bruising my feet.</li>
    <li> Pretty good.  The water beads are unavoidable, but it is fogless.  You have to run the mirror under the hot water for about 20 seconds to get the mirror to be fogless. I wish it was a suction cup instead of a sticker for the hook that holds the mirror.  You can&#x27;t travel with it and you can&#x27;t reposition it in your shower once you initially install it.  That is the reason for 1-star off perfect.</li>
    <li> I should have double-checked the dimensions.  It is pretty flimsy and too small.  The plastic hook that is provided for the razor doesn&#x27;t even work.  Live and learn.</li>
    <li> It works as advertised. I have had it for over a month and i&#x27;m happy with the product and would recommend it.</li>
</ol>
