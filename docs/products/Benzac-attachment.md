### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best of all, the 2% Sallicylic Acid did wonders for a blemish caused by an ingrown hair follicle.  </li>
      <li>My son therefore uses it in combination which is probably the best method for him.  </li>
      <li>The best way to avoid &amp;#34;blemishes&amp;#34; is by best care of your skin, but if you should have the pimple pop up, then this treatment will work great with some alcohol pads in your pocket.</li>
      <li>This is made by the makers of Cetaphil, another really good product!</li>
      <li>This stuff works great on my hormone induced acne.  </li>
      <li>With a name like Benzac, I was (happily) surprized to find this is not benzoyl peroxide based.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
      <li>This stuff is great at drying.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!!</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t as successful with the deeper acne.</li>
      <li>It works best at night time after washing your face, since it doesn&#x27;t react so well when trying to apply foundation on the top</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a way to stop a breakout this is a good option.</li>
      <li>The lotion is also good as a dual moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>This probably is a good addition to your armamentarium for the war against acne.</li>
      <li>(so, it also feels like a fair investment for consumers).    </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>As a spot treatment, this is really nice.</li>
      <li>all kind of liquids or gels).</li>
      <li>It is easy to use, seems really effective, and has a pleasant smell (well, comparatively).</li>
      <li>Just be forewarned that it is very strong</li>
      <li>It is best used in conjunction of the Benzac Skin Balancing Foaming Cleanser and Benzac Blemish Clearing Hydrator for a complete treatment plan.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Honestly, I&#x27;m not how sure I could like this product more.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s clearly a great alternative to ProActive like treatments at a more reasonable cost.</li>
      <li>I love how the Hydrator makes my face feel.  </li>
      <li>Once my free sample is gone, I&#x27;m going to immediately buy another tube as well as investigate the Skin Balancing Foaming Cleanser and Blemish Clearing Hydrator!</li>
      <li>That stuff works like magic.  </li>
      <li>Sure.</li>
      <li>It does have benzoil peroxide, but I find that my skin responds better to sulfur based spot treatments.  </li>
      <li>This spot treatment is not my favorite...</li>
      <li>It is more of a gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Way better than some of the over the counter meds you get for skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s why I love Benzac.</li>
      <li>and it did an even better job in 2 days.  </li>
      <li>However, it also means that the product is packaged containing more air space, therefore more air, which, I suspect may affecs</li>
      <li>It smells good and our teen says it seems to work fairly well.  </li>
      <li>The scent is actually very nice, like almost a faint and pleasant perfume kind of nice.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it for 2 days and the acne faded very quickly.  </li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t so strong it burns</li>
      <li>Both are usually fairly resistant to trying new things.</li>
      <li>The opening to the tube is HUGE.</li>
      <li>I have used this for spot treatments, and so far so good.</li>
      <li>So I would imagine those with ongoing acne issues that the complete Benxac regimen is a good choice.  </li>
      <li>I was really impressed with how quickly this product dried up my pimples.  </li>
      <li>To use clean the skin thoroughly then apply to the site.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very liquid formula, so it needs a more petite opening.  </li>
      <li>The full ingredients are Alcohol, Water, Witch Hazel, Sunflower Seed Oil, Citric Acid, Sandalwood, Fistulosum Bulb Extract, Backhousia Citriodora Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, EthylParaben, Butylparaben, MethylParaben, Cardiospermum Flower, Potassium Sorbate and Benzoate, Tocopherol and Echium Seed Oil.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very liquid formula, so it needs a more petite opening.  </li>
      <li>I did NOT use the whole system, might have more stars if I did.&lt;br</li>
      <li>did give the product the full four star rating of the formula, without deducting points for the packaging, however, do note that the package is one of the reason I don&#x27;t expect to repurchase.</li>
      <li>(Just go easy with the kit at first to avoid over-drying your skin .. which will cause redness, flaking, and peeling).    </li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m pretty sure that is part of it) or they just aren&#x27;t effective enough at getting to the root of the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>All good, worth the extra money.</li>
      <li>However,  quickly noted that that was by design.  </li>
      <li>This is a mild product for spots and works like you would expect a mild product to work.  </li>
      <li>Now, if you are suffering from more substantial outbreaks, I highly recommend invest in this line of products.</li>
      <li>This spot-treatment is outstanding for those little emergency moments (in fact, it is considerably better than most).</li>
      <li>My son (17) has had some pretty persistent acne, primarily on his chin.  </li>
      <li>I tried this Intensive Spot Treatment, which contains 2 % Salicylic Acid and Sandalwood Oil, which gives it a pleasant smell versus the alcohol based scents of other creams and astringents I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>favorite spot treatment by far is the Mario Badescu Drying Lotion.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Because of the above reasons, I really liked the Benzac Intensive Spot Treatment.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Both were glad this goes on clear.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Both reported some burning sensation when they first applied it, but it quickly went away.</li>
      <li>the liquid inside flows out pretty quickly.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s clear and absorbs very quickly and dries quickly.  </li>
      <li>I was glad to see it didn&#x27;t dry the spot out, as sometimes happens with strong spot treatments.</li>
      <li>It goes on clear, dries VERY VERY fast, has a more neutral odor, and doesn&#x27;t appear to cause buildup.  </li>
      <li>Not having new stuff makes a huge difference though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good product, but there&#x27;s really nothing about it that truly distinguished it from other products.  </li>
      <li>Salycillic acid is, based on both my knoowledge and experience, a slightly more gentle product, and it is well suited for those whose issues tend more toward black heads.  </li>
      <li>Couple of days later the breakout was mostly gone.</li>
      <li>This is the standard ingredient and concentration found in most acne treatments.</li>
      <li>This really works for spot treatment!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m also using the Hydrator of this same product line and I like that much more.  </li>
      <li>I use a dab at the first sight of acne and it goes away within 24-36 hours.</li>
      <li>There is a lot of air along with the product in the container and the product consistently squirts out all over my hands when I use it.  </li>
      <li>I first cleaned my face and then applied the spot treatment to the affected area overnight.</li>
      <li>comment was that it is pretty easy to use, but especially the first couple of days, \\&quot;It stung when I put it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a once or twice daily application and is easy to do after thoroughly cleaning the face.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s less likely than benzoyl peroxide to produce peeling, and I can happily report no peeling with its use (and my skin is rather prone to peel).  </li>
      <li>This spot treatment claims to rapidly clear and calm blemished skin.  </li>
      <li>This product works very well.</li>
      <li>very fast.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really see that this is helping me when I have a breakout.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Something that really stood out to me</li>
      <li>This review is not for the whole system, just the Intensive Spot Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The product doesn&#x27;t seem to cause much redness or irritation on my skin</li>
      <li>(you can use it with foundation if you put it on very sparingly).  </li>
      <li>And I am finding that I really don&#x27;t like the container this is in.  </li>
      <li>This is fantastic for that occasional blemish.</li>
      <li>This product is a leap forward and relies on a very rare traditional medicine that has been used since biblical times.</li>
      <li>The Benzac is similar to spot treatments from other brands and isn&#x27;t as good as the Mario Badescu.</li>
      <li>In only 3-4 days, the blemish had shrunk to about 1/4 of the original surface diameter and the depth had shrunk by 50%.  </li>
      <li>This spot treatment works pretty well to clear up persistent acne.  </li>
      <li>But, if you are suffering from a larger issue, do consider the full system and do consult your physician.</li>
      <li>and it really does treat acne far better than any other over the counter (OTC) product e.g. containing benzoyl peroxide etc.  </li>
      <li>so I was really pleased to have it gone in half the time.  </li>
      <li>I do think using this spot treatment is a good choice for people who don&#x27;t need to use a harsh cleanser on their entire face.</li>
      <li>Which I will explain as I go onto the main issue.</li>
      <li>My first issue is more cosmetic, but is a function to a small degree.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been after this product for months as it works and had to import.  I even contacted the company to fully understand how it works.  It turns out the secret is not the salicylic acid, but really the sandalwood oil.  They have completed trials on the oil and it really does treat acne far better than any other over the counter (OTC) product e.g. containing benzoyl peroxide etc.  This product is a leap forward and relies on a very rare traditional medicine that has been used since biblical times.</li>
    <li> This review is not for the whole system, just the Intensive Spot Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With teenagers in the house you can bet acne is a thing. Unlike other acne remedies we&#x27;ve tried, this cream has almost no odor and goes on without leaving tell-tale residue, which is crucial for facial acne. It dries fast and so far seems to be working well, drying out the area without drying the skin too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will update.</li>
    <li> I am not sure this can be called an &amp;#34;intensive&amp;#34; treatment.  It seems to be gentler than Benzoyl Peroxide...which is a benefit if you want to avoid the peeling and dry skin.  This goes on without oiliness and doesn&#x27;t end up making the skin dry.  However, it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as the Benzoyl peroxide.  My son therefore uses it in combination which is probably the best method for him.  This is one of those things you have to experiment with to see what works for you.  This probably is a good addition to your armamentarium for the war against acne.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a way to stop a breakout this is a good option. The spot treatment is a gel with salicylic acid, witch hazel and sandalwood oil. This tends to dry out acne or spots fairly quickly. As soon as the alcohol and water have evaporated it leaves a slight film on the skin to protect the area being treated. I noticed my skin does peel a bit when using this product. I&#x27;d use this for a day or two and then switch to a healing salve like [[ASIN:B00GM77XPA Renaud Naturals In the Pink Herbal Balm 2 Oz]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> I have used this for spot treatments, and so far so good. If seems to work faster on my face than in others areas.</li>
    <li> As someone who has suffered from acne the last few years since my pregnancy and hormonal changes, I have tried many acne creams to minimize the monthly breakouts I get before and during my menstrual cycle. I tried this Intensive Spot Treatment, which contains 2 % Salicylic Acid and Sandalwood Oil, which gives it a pleasant smell versus the alcohol based scents of other creams and astringents I&#x27;ve tried. Sandalwood oil is actually an herbal antiseptic that kills bacteria which can cause acne. I like that this is a clear gel so it goes on clear and dries clear and you can also wear it under make up without a caking affect under the make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before applying the Intensive Spot Treatment, you&#x27;ll need to wash your face thoroughly and it spreads on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t burn or sting my skin like other creams and astringents do, so it&#x27;s much gentler on the skin and doesn&#x27;t cause irritation and redness. One word of caution is that depending on your skin type, it may cause drying and flaking of the skin, so you&#x27;ll want to apply it only to the area of breakout, not your whole face in case it dries your skin type out. For me, who has oily skin, it did not cause drying or flaking though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as effectiveness, I found that this cleared my skin of acne within 2-3 days, which is the norm with products like this, so it didn&#x27;t work overnight miracles. I would definitely use this again because I like the gentleness of the Sandalwood oil over other acne products and it is effective.</li>
    <li> The treatment was for my two teens. Both are usually fairly resistant to trying new things. But I got them to try this as an acne cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both were glad this goes on clear. It can be used during the day, and no one can tell it&#x27;s there. It is more of a gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both reported some burning sensation when they first applied it, but it quickly went away. So there wasn&#x27;t skin discomfort- even with my daughter who has very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other bumps not treated with the treatment, we didn&#x27;t see immediate results, but I do think that the treatment helped over time.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great on my hormone induced acne.  Just be forewarned that it is very strong so I would only dab 1-2 x/day Maximum and maybe even skip a day between treatments.  I could see by my dry skin (on acne) that it continued working a day later. It contains Salicyclic acid so again, just use sparingly.  Finally, it is a &amp;#34;spot&amp;#34; treatment - if you have lots of acne, this would become way too expensive and it would also over-dry your skin.  But for occasional &amp;#34;spot&amp;#34; treatment, it works as advertised! I use a dab at the first sight of acne and it goes away within 24-36 hours.</li>
    <li> This really works for spot treatment!  I was really impressed with how quickly this product dried up my pimples.  I have break-outs every so often and sometimes they are huge and painful.  I cannot vouch as to whether or not this treatment can prevent breakouts as it claims.  I tried using this Benzac instead of my regular cream and it did an even better job in 2 days.  It is a clear gel but a little bit too liquid in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something that really stood out to me was that my skin didn&#x27;t peel around the zit after a day or two.  With my regular Clearasil cream, my skin always peels which only seems to elongate my embarrassment.  It could be because this product is made with 2% Salicylic acid as opposed to the 10% Benzoyl peroxide in Clearasil, but I am not a chemist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product and its effectiveness but I am not thrilled with the consistency of the gel because it comes out quickly and sometime drips, wasting quite a bit of the product.  The tube it comes in is also only about half full and it is only .5 oz.  This is made by the makers of Cetaphil, another really good product!</li>
    <li> This one works ok, but it stinks.</li>
    <li> They call it &amp;#34;Benzac,&amp;#34; but the ingredients are the same as what you find in other creams: 2% Salicylic Acid. This is the standard ingredient and concentration found in most acne treatments. (The other common infredient is Benzoyl Peroxide.)&lt;br /&gt;This cream also claims to contain some sort of &amp;#34;soothing oil,&amp;#34; but when i tried it, i found it actually stung a bit until I rubbed it in for a minute or two.&lt;br /&gt;  There is nothing new under the sun here, so to speak.&lt;br /&gt;  Will it work? Sure. Just as all other creams or wipes or liquids that have Salicylic Acid in them will work.</li>
    <li> As a spot treatment, this is really nice. Way better than some of the over the counter meds you get for skin. The best way to avoid &amp;#34;blemishes&amp;#34; is by best care of your skin, but if you should have the pimple pop up, then this treatment will work great with some alcohol pads in your pocket. Of course the key to blemish treatment (when it arrives) is to dry it out and keep it clean. This stuff is great at drying. It is easy to use, seems really effective, and has a pleasant smell (well, comparatively). All good, worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! I am a 37 year old who frequently still deals with acne outbreaks. It&#x27;s not like was when I was a teen, but there is nothing more embarrassing than being a grown adult, dressed for work, with a  massive zit on your cheek. Oh wait, yes there is... when you can clearly see the acne medication slathered on it.  That&#x27;s why I love Benzac. It&#x27;s clear. But that&#x27;s not the only reason. The biggest reason: it works.  I have used it several times for big breakouts in the morning and my face was calmed down by evening. My daughter who is 12 and has sensitive but acne prone skin has also been using it. Before this, we had been using Proactiv but still suffering breakouts. I think it may be time to change to this line! Love it!</li>
    <li> This is in reference to the intensive spot treatment only. The formula contains 2 percent Salicylic Acid and East Indian Sandalwood as one of it&#x27;s main ingredients and this does seem to have a smoothing cooling calming effect on the skin. Also has anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties to it. This isn&#x27;t so strong it burns and it may work to clear blemished skin and may work for inflamed skin depending on what is causing the inflammation. Will work to penetrate the pores, clear blemishes and help prevent new ones. To use clean the skin thoroughly then apply to the site. The formula is non comedogenic, free of artificial fragrances, dyes and has no scent to it. The full ingredients are Alcohol, Water, Witch Hazel, Sunflower Seed Oil, Citric Acid, Sandalwood, Fistulosum Bulb Extract, Backhousia Citriodora Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, EthylParaben, Butylparaben, MethylParaben, Cardiospermum Flower, Potassium Sorbate and Benzoate, Tocopherol and Echium Seed Oil. If you have any problems with dryness you can just use less though I find this product has a decent amount of moisture. This should work with small blemishes or as a spot treatment.</li>
    <li> This is a review for the Spot Treatment only. I gave this to my acne covered teen. It is a thin gel and smells like sandalwood. Teen has eczema, but this product did not sting or irritate his skin. While it did not miraculously clear up the blemishes overnight - it did help keep his face dry and clean for faster healing.</li>
    <li> This spot treatment works pretty well to clear up persistent acne.  It does sting just slightly and it leaves a bit of an almost rubbery film if you put it on too heavily.  The scent is actually very nice, like almost a faint and pleasant perfume kind of nice.  It works best at night time after washing your face, since it doesn&#x27;t react so well when trying to apply foundation on the top (you can use it with foundation if you put it on very sparingly).  The tube doesn&#x27;t hold a lot, and the liquid inside flows out pretty quickly.  If you&#x27;re not careful you can lose a larger portion of it the first time trying to get some out.  If you&#x27;re factoring the harshness vs. effectiveness quality of this product, I&#x27;d give it an 9 out of 10.  I don&#x27;t feel like this is a product for people with severe acne.  But for minor acne, it does the trick</li>
    <li> This is a mild product for spots and works like you would expect a mild product to work.  It smells good and our teen says it seems to work fairly well.  These things are difficult to judge without a very long span of time so I can just say it seems to be working well.</li>
    <li> This product works very well. I have breakouts occasionally and this spot treatment seems to help reduce the intensity and duration of a breakout. It is best used in conjunction of the Benzac Skin Balancing Foaming Cleanser and Benzac Blemish Clearing Hydrator for a complete treatment plan. I first cleaned my face and then applied the spot treatment to the affected area overnight. By the next day, the breakout had reduced in size and dried up significantly. Couple of days later the breakout was mostly gone. The product doesn&#x27;t seem to cause much redness or irritation on my skin but it does overdry the skin. It&#x27;s a once or twice daily application and is easy to do after thoroughly cleaning the face. I don&#x27;t know if it helps neutralize new breakouts before they emerge but it does cut down the duration of a breakout to half. I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
    <li> This works as well as the name brand skin blemish system because it is the same active ingredient. 2 % Salicylic Acid</li>
    <li> NOTE: This review is ONLY for the Benzac Intensive Spot Treatment, .5 Ounce, product.  I was not given a sample of the other two products in the Benzac Complete Acne Solution Regimen Kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I frequently use some type of topical acne cream since puberty to deal with my somewhat oily skin.  The typical product that I&#x27;ve used is the white Benzoyl Peroxide of varying strength such as [[ASIN:B000052YJX Neutrogena On-The-Spot]].  The problem with these, beyond that most of them are tinted white, is that they typically leave a small amount of buildup that continues to grow over the spot which actually accentuates the blemish.  They also take awhile to dry on, smell weird, and bleach my skin if I use them too much on sunny days.  Even with all that, the normal over-the-counter products don&#x27;t work very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the above reasons, I really liked the Benzac Intensive Spot Treatment.  It goes on clear, dries VERY VERY fast, has a more neutral odor, and doesn&#x27;t appear to cause buildup.  Best of all, the 2% Sallicylic Acid did wonders for a blemish caused by an ingrown hair follicle.  In only 3-4 days, the blemish had shrunk to about 1/4 of the original surface diameter and the depth had shrunk by 50%.  I&#x27;ve also used it on traditional blemishes on my face and in my nose and ear and it worked equally well in all applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I&#x27;m not how sure I could like this product more.  Although the tube opening is largish for the liquid product, but not any larger than other products I&#x27;ve used, dispensing a little more than I probably needed wasn&#x27;t really an issue to me.  Once my free sample is gone, I&#x27;m going to immediately buy another tube as well as investigate the Skin Balancing Foaming Cleanser and Blemish Clearing Hydrator!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s clear and absorbs very quickly and dries quickly.  Can be applied under the make up.  I&#x27;ve used it for 2 days and the acne faded very quickly.  The only complaint I have is the tube is full of air when you first open it and actual ointment inside is less than half of the tube actually shows. I would recommend this for spot treatment for occasional break outs.</li>
    <li> This spot treatment claims to rapidly clear and calm blemished skin.  I do prefer spot treatments because I tend toward sporadic, isolated acne and don&#x27;t want to dry out my entire face trying to pinpoint three pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This treatment comes in a small tube with a large spout - usually one of the drops that comes out is enough for all of my problem areas.  You put it on after toner but before moisturizer.  It tingles slightly going on, which I don&#x27;t like.  It doesn&#x27;t feel calming at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product, I don&#x27;t feel like my acne healed more rapidly than usual.  I do think it looked less red while it healed, which was a benefit.  I do think using this spot treatment is a good choice for people who don&#x27;t need to use a harsh cleanser on their entire face.</li>
    <li> Soothing oils allow this intensive spot treatment to to give relief for bad acne. And it allows for quicker healing. Although it does what it says, I don&#x27;t really see much difference between these and a lot of other name brands. I give this four stars and a thumbs up.</li>
    <li> My son (17) has had some pretty persistent acne, primarily on his chin.  I&#x27;ve given him various products to use, but either he isn&#x27;t consistent about using them (I&#x27;m pretty sure that is part of it) or they just aren&#x27;t effective enough at getting to the root of the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Benzac Intensive Spot Treatment has made a visible difference in just one week.  He knows I have to review this, so I know he is using it once a day.  His skin isn&#x27;t clear yet, but it is much clearer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His comment was that it is pretty easy to use, but especially the first couple of days, \\&quot;It stung when I put it on.\\&quot;  He hasn&#x27;t had problems with getting too much product from the tube, but his younger brother (who has the occasional pimple or two) feels like he always gets too much product when he tried using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my eldest son, what I&#x27;m noticing is that he doesn&#x27;t have new breakouts.  The old stuff is slowly (s-l-o-w-l-y) healing.  Not having new stuff makes a huge difference though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> This is an average to above average salycillic acid acne treatment.  It&#x27;s a good product, but there&#x27;s really nothing about it that truly distinguished it from other products.  In fact, I think I may slightly prefer Clearasil&#x27;s rapid acting salycillic product.  Overal, it&#x27;sa good product, horribly packaged (more about that below).  With a name like Benzac, I was (happily) surprized to find this is not benzoyl peroxide based.  Salycillic acid is, based on both my knoowledge and experience, a slightly more gentle product, and it is well suited for those whose issues tend more toward black heads.  It&#x27;s less likely than benzoyl peroxide to produce peeling, and I can happily report no peeling with its use (and my skin is rather prone to peel).  I also have rather sensitive skin and this was non-irritating.  Lots of things to like, and based on product alone, I would consider repurchasing.  However, since there are other similiar (and more readily available to me) products that I like at least as well, and I hate this packaging, it is unlikely that I will.&lt;br /&gt;As product performance is, overall, reasonable but not miraculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is not reasonable.  It&#x27;s annoying.  It desperately needs to be redesigned.  My first issue is more cosmetic, but is a function to a small degree.  The issue is a not-full tube.  The tube initialy feels half empty, which was odd.  However,  quickly noted that that was by design.  The tube is approximately the same size as a 1 oz tube of a competing product, but contains .5 oz.  So there&#x27;s a perception of value that isn&#x27;t there.  However, it also means that the product is packaged containing more air space, therefore more air, which, I suspect may affecs it&#x27;s efficacy. It definately affects its use.  Which I will explain as I go onto the main issue. The opening to the tube is HUGE. Up to 3x larger than those of competing products.  No matter how careful I was, I was consistently squeezin out twice the product needed (this problem is compounded by the half empty tube, since you are squeezing product from the bottom).  It&#x27;s a very liquid formula, so it needs a more petite opening.  It&#x27;s designed for waste and mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did give the product the full four star rating of the formula, without deducting points for the packaging, however, do note that the package is one of the reason I don&#x27;t expect to repurchase.em is compounded by the half empty tube, since you are squeezing product from the bottom).

    <li> This product worked extremely well to reduce the size and the duration of a recent small outbreak.  I don&#x27;t have a serious issue with acne but do occasionally have a breakout.  I followed the directions and by the second day, the pimples were half the size of the previous day and were shortly gone.  It generally takes at least a week for an outbreak to go away so I was really pleased to have it gone in half the time.  I will certainly use this again in the future and will to get it on at the first sign of a new pimple.</li>
    <li> This spot treatment is average.  I didn&#x27;t really notice much of a difference, maybe it slightly sped up the spot reduction process.  It does have benzoil peroxide, but I find that my skin responds better to sulfur based spot treatments.  I prefer to use 2.5% benzoil peroxide all over my skin as a preventive measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite spot treatment by far is the Mario Badescu Drying Lotion.  That stuff works like magic.  The Benzac is similar to spot treatments from other brands and isn&#x27;t as good as the Mario Badescu.</li>
    <li> I have used this with a couple of outbreaks, and I found it particularly useful for smaller, surface blemishes. It wasn&#x27;t as successful with the deeper acne. I was glad to see it didn&#x27;t dry the spot out, as sometimes happens with strong spot treatments. This product uses salicylic acid instead of benzoyl peroxide, which tends to really dry my face out. It seemed to get rid of the acne within a day or two, which is faster than without any treatment. I would use this product again.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic for that occasional blemish. It works fast, is less drying than some products, and the tube should last you a little while (so, it also feels like a fair investment for consumers).    Now, if you are suffering from more substantial outbreaks, I highly recommend invest in this line of products. The cleanser and the hydrator can really accelerate the healing process and may prevent further break-outs from occurring. (Just go easy with the kit at first to avoid over-drying your skin .. which will cause redness, flaking, and peeling).    This spot-treatment is outstanding for those little emergency moments (in fact, it is considerably better than most). But, if you are suffering from a larger issue, do consider the full system and do consult your physician.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really see that this is helping me when I have a breakout.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to make a big difference whether I use this or not.  The blemishes do not seem to go away any faster when using this.  And I am finding that I really don&#x27;t like the container this is in.  There is a lot of air along with the product in the container and the product consistently squirts out all over my hands when I use it.  There is no way to store the item upright, so after using it, it gets laid down again and the product pools to the side of the container.  I&#x27;ve tried to flick the product down to the opening of the container before using it and that has helped a little, but it hasn&#x27;t completely solved the problem of the product over squirting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also using the Hydrator of this same product line and I like that much more.  I love how the Hydrator makes my face feel.  This spot treatment is not my favorite...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my forties so acne is not much of an issue, but I do get an occasional pimple with stress, sweat or certain foods etc.  In the past month, I had two.  One near beard growth and another on my back.  I used the Benaz cleanser on the areas and then applied the spot treatment.  Both were gone by the next day.  I only needed one application.  So I would imagine those with ongoing acne issues that the complete Benxac regimen is a good choice.  There was no discomfort or drying feeling and the treatment is not visible.  Not much was needed to clear my problem areas  The lotion is also good as a dual moisturizer.  It&#x27;s clearly a great alternative to ProActive like treatments at a more reasonable cost.</li>
    <li> I did NOT use the whole system, might have more stars if I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have occasional acne (not just on my face) &amp; I am an adult. I used benzoil peroxide when I was a kid and often it bleached my clothes. I switched to the sulfur (usually the tinted cream from clearasil) and used that when I could get it (not always in stock). I also tried other salicylic acid preparations (they aren&#x27;t really creams...they&#x27;re all kind of liquids or gels). I didn&#x27;t think they worked as well as the sulfur. The sulfur takes a long time to work though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this (the intensive spot treatment only) to work well the couple times I have used it in the last month. The actual acne spot was gone in a day...but the temporary pink irritated area remained for longer than it usually does with the sulfur. This might not be the case with the three step treatment. I may give it a try and report back.</li>
