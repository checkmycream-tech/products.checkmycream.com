      <li>I love theses brushes.</li>
      <li>These are a good set to add to a collection, or a great set for starting out a brush collection.  </li>
      <li>I have been watching Youtube videos and learning more and more about applying eyeshadow correctly.</li>
      <li>I have really enjoyed them.</li>
      <li>But there ok.</li>
      <li>Love these.</li>
      <li>These brushes are beautiful, very soft, and don&#x27;t shed at all.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure that blending is like, a must for a good smokey eye, so</li>
      <li>The case is pretty nice too.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s fine..</li>
      <li>I wish there was a fine liner brush included.</li>
      <li>Fantastic quality brush set.</li>
      <li>The angle brush is my favorite for eyeliner because the bristles are the right about of stiff/</li>
      <li>I guess it&#x27;s my fault for just being so excited and not thoroughly reading the description.</li>
      <li>She loved them so much she had me order 5 more to give as gifts in the future.</li>
      <li>These are my new favorite eye brushes.</li>
      <li>I had already bought bigger brush set from Costal Scent wich I love!</li>
      <li>Still a great little set.</li>
      <li>personally never use the pouches that brushes come in, but this one seemed nice.</li>
      <li>I chose these because they are made of natural hair which hold pigments better.</li>
      <li>I previously used only Mary Kay products-and especially the brush set-these eye brushes are amazing and every variation needed to produce gorgeous eyes is there!!</li>
      <li>They applied makeup nicely, were easy to clean and dried fast.</li>
      <li>They work wonderfully for applying my favorite eyeshadow with minimal fallout (way less than my old set).</li>
      <li>I could never perfect a perfect cat eye until now.</li>
      <li>Exactly what was pictured.</li>
      <li>They pick up the pigment of the eyeshadows exactly and blend well.</li>
      <li>On the left side it actually has simple quick instructions on how and what to use each brush for they liked that :)</li>
      <li>so much I am buying 2 more sets, another for me to have extra and one for my sister.</li>
      <li>Super soft, affordable, quality brush set.  </li>
      <li>Instructions arent very clear or useful.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;-why are the eyeshadow brushes so large?</li>
      <li>I really enjoy coastal scents products, very good prices for a good quality, I&#x27;ve bought things of the same price and had them shed and break down like crazy</li>
      <li>I really like this set of brushes.</li>
      <li>Very affordable without compromising on quality.</li>
      <li>Really overall pleased with the Coastal Scents brand products I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
      <li>I wanted a small brush set that would fit in my purse, or that was easy to travel with.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have many makeup brushes, and don&#x27;t really know how to compare them to other sets, but for what I need (eyeshadow brushes)</li>
      <li>The brushes are so soft and better quality than I expected.</li>
      <li>I bought both this one and Coastal Scents Classic 5 Piece Brush Set.</li>
      <li>The price is very reasonable, especially for the high quality of the set.</li>
      <li>They have not shed at all, and they are very soft on my skin.</li>
      <li>and they are very very soft.</li>
      <li>No shedding, nice balance, very fluffy and soft, and all the brushes actually do the job they are intended to do!</li>
      <li>the brushes are just too large for it to go where it&#x27;s intended only.</li>
      <li>Brushes are soft.</li>
      <li>far the hairs are still on</li>
      <li>That said, I wish I had gotten a larger set with a few more medium/small size brushes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m new to makeup and wanted to finally try and learn how to do a smokey eye .</li>
      <li>So I say that&#x27;s a major</li>
      <li>and the other is just large.</li>

    <li> I actually really enjoy these brushes, I feel like they are good quality and they are very very soft. The little case they come in is convenient for travel and I take them with me when I stay away from home. I really enjoy coastal scents products, very good prices for a good quality, I&#x27;ve bought things of the same price and had them shed and break down like crazy but I haven&#x27;t had any issues with coastal scents.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing! They pick up the pigment of the eyeshadows exactly and blend well. Very good for travel kit!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my cousin. She loved them so much she had me order 5 more to give as gifts in the future. So I say that&#x27;s a major plus. And she&#x27;s done tried SOO many different brushes from low end to HIGHLY expensive ones. But these were a winner(:</li>
    <li> Fantastic quality brush set. Hold their shape after cleaning.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my teenage niece as a gift with a shadow set. Very pleased with product.</li>
    <li> My wife said perfect.</li>
    <li> Instructions arent very clear or useful.  Brushes are soft. Case is plastic with magnetic closure.</li>
    <li> Love the brushes perfect size</li>
    <li> Everything you need for a smokey eye. The brushes are so soft and better quality than I expected.</li>
    <li> Excellent set of eye brushes!! I have really enjoyed them. I previously used only Mary Kay products-and especially the brush set-these eye brushes are amazing and every variation needed to produce gorgeous eyes is there!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are beautiful, very soft, and don&#x27;t shed at all. I&#x27;m amazed that they&#x27;re so inexpensive!</li>
    <li> Perfect brushes, good price</li>
    <li> Provides all the brushes you need to get some great shades on and blending them. nice and keep their shape.</li>
    <li> I really like this set of brushes. I don&#x27;t have many makeup brushes, and don&#x27;t really know how to compare them to other sets, but for what I need (eyeshadow brushes) these are perfect and were a great price! Really overall pleased with the Coastal Scents brand products I&#x27;ve tried so far. Very affordable without compromising on quality.</li>
    <li> in order to have a perfect smokey eye you have to have a smudge brush. the image and description led me to believe there was one and it was lacking. I can not use this kit, but my sister does and she likes it.</li>
    <li> Love them very nice cheap set of brushes</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift along with the coastal scents 252 eye shadow palette. The brushes seem very nice.</li>
    <li> Everything you need to get started. They applied makeup nicely, were easy to clean and dried fast. That said, I wish I had gotten a larger set with a few more medium/small size brushes.</li>
    <li> They are perfect for traveling, with that lovely protective wallet.&lt;br /&gt;So far the hairs are still on&lt;br /&gt;This is just what I was looking for, and good value for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to makeup and wanted to finally try and learn how to do a smokey eye . The quality of the brushes is fine,no complaints there. However, I have 3 issues with this product&lt;br /&gt;-no blending brush. I&#x27;m pretty sure that blending is like, a must for a good smokey eye, so what the heck kind of &amp;#34;Smokey eye&amp;#34; brush set doesn&#x27;t come with a blending brush. I guess it&#x27;s my fault for just being so excited and not thoroughly reading the description. They did include the dome smudger brush, which I&#x27;m assuming should be used for the blending? Eh, depends on youur preference I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-why are the eyeshadow brushes so large? One in medium and the other is just large. This makes it difficult to correctly appy the eyeshadow bc the brushes are just too large for it to go where it&#x27;s intended only. Result: messy look/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Where&#x27;s the crease brush? The seller included some eyelash/comb brush thingy and it was really confusing. I paid for a crease brush. I have no crease brush. That&#x27;s a problem. How am I suppose to do a smokey eye with this &amp;#34;Smokey Eye Brush Set&amp;#34; without a brush for my crease. It&#x27;s really frustrating .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that&#x27;s my review, I hope it helps someone. Please take these things into consideration before buying.</li>
    <li> Exactly what was pictured.</li>
    <li> Perfect eye shadow brushes ! Grate for traveling overall BUY IT ! ❤️❤️❤️❤️</li>
    <li> Thanks&lt;br /&gt;They should also be</li>
    <li> Very, very nice set. I will be using these for a long time.</li>
    <li> These are nice brushes. I wish there was a fine liner brush included. I chose these because they are made of natural hair which hold pigments better. The case is pretty nice too.</li>
    <li> I love theses brushes. I have been watching Youtube videos and learning more and more about applying eyeshadow correctly. I wanted a small brush set that would fit in my purse, or that was easy to travel with. This fit the bill perfectly. Also one of the the reviewers said this doenst have a blending brush, but Yes, yes it does! I like it so much I am buying 2 more sets, another for me to have extra and one for my sister. Love it!</li>
    <li> Bought these for my daughters for stocking stuffers, they both loved it! On the left side it actually has simple quick instructions on how and what to use each brush for they liked that :)</li>
    <li> Excellent quality for both the brushes and the case.</li>
    <li> Some of the brushes shed. But there ok.</li>
    <li> great gift for my sister. She really liked it. No clue on quality.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted!! I got a beautiful smokey eye with these brushes!!</li>
    <li> Love these! These are my new favorite eye brushes. They have not shed at all, and they are very soft on my skin. They work wonderfully for applying my favorite eyeshadow with minimal fallout (way less than my old set). The angle brush is my favorite for eyeliner because the bristles are the right about of stiff/soft.&lt;br /&gt;It is hard to tell from the picture but these brushes are short, like 5-6&amp;#34; long maybe. This doesn&#x27;t bother me in the slightest but other people may not like it.&lt;br /&gt;I personally never use the pouches that brushes come in, but this one seemed nice.</li>
    <li> I looove these brushes, especially the eyeliner brush. I could never perfect a perfect cat eye until now. Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Love these. Unfortunately one of the brushes sheds like crazy. I washes it multiple times hoping it would stop but no luck. Still a great little set.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the best but it&#x27;s fine..I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I needed nice presents for some of my friends, all my girlfriends use makeup and this brush set is the perfect size to have in your purse I had already bought bigger brush set from Costal Scent wich I love! So this was never a question, knew I would get some quality and the price is just hilariously low! I bought both this one and Coastal Scents Classic 5 Piece Brush Set. Grate for presents!</li>
    <li> Super soft, affordable, quality brush set.  Got these for my daughters at Christmas and they love them! I tried them a couple of times and bought a set for myself.  No shedding, nice balance, very fluffy and soft, and all the brushes actually do the job they are intended to do! These are a good set to add to a collection, or a great set for starting out a brush collection.  The price is very reasonable, especially for the high quality of the set.</li>
