      <li>my skin is super sensitive and ultra dry...</li>
      <li>It foams up really well, but doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my face too much.  </li>

      <li>For sensitive skin?</li>
      <li>My skin is soft and dewy.</li>
      <li>/&gt;But, to really get the redness out, you need Triderma&#x27;s Facial Redness Lotion.  </li>

      <li>but my 11 year old son who is starting to break out has also benefited.</li>
      <li>I developed rosacea a few years ago and nothing really worked on it.</li>

<li> I get small flare ups, but it is very under control with triderma</li>
<li> I also recommend it for use as a shaving cream -- the foam is enough to reduce razor drag, and it definitely reduces irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> I have been using it for a little over a year</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t get to use it long enough to know how the results would be because it was breaking out my face too bad.</li>

<li> for me at least.</li>
<li> and i haven&#x27;t broken out at all...</li>
<li> Put a thin layer of that on after washing your face before bed, and guess what?  </li>
<li> but I was wrong.</li>
<li> I hate greasy formulas or those that feel thin and don&#x27;t moisturize sufficiently.</li>

    <li> I use this when I face gets irritated from too much sun or being out in the cold wind too long in winter.  It foams up really well, but doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my face too much.  And when i have redness it lessens it a bit.  I also recommend it for use as a shaving cream -- the foam is enough to reduce razor drag, and it definitely reduces irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, to really get the redness out, you need Triderma&#x27;s Facial Redness Lotion.  Put a thin layer of that on after washing your face before bed, and guess what?  No redness the next day... for me at least.</li>
    <li> Works ok. Doesn&#x27;t get rid of the red, but it doesn&#x27;t cause it either.</li>
    <li> Ive suffered from a red complexion most my life, I bought this stuff after using the tri derma facial redness repair. Neither products worked for me. The cleanser has made me break out and the repair cream leaves my face greasy and red. I have started using neutrogena ultra soothing lotion which has a SPF  and I have noticed the red in my face tone down quite a bit.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get to use it long enough to know how the results would be because it was breaking out my face too bad.</li>
    <li> my skin is super sensitive and ultra dry...i break out (acne) from everything and everything dry&#x27;s my skin out...but i really like this face wash...i&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and i haven&#x27;t broken out at all...it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my face out either...although it&#x27;s hard to tell because i start off very dry before washing, but it doesn&#x27;t make it worse...also, you only need a small amount and it lasts a long time, so all in all i really like this wash and it has become my go to!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly for the redness in my skin. I am interracial (Caucasian and Black) and it hard for me to find products that work for my very sensitive skin. This works great.</li>
    <li> I have suffered from rosacea for over 15 years and this product seems to really be helping as much as the RX stuff.  Definitely recommended.  There&#x27;s no cure, but this is definitely helping</li>
    <li> I have rosacea and this works great for me.  I no longer take antibiotics and my skin is better than it has been in years!</li>
    <li> If you have rosacea, this is an absolute must! I have been using it for a little over a year and it changed my complexion instantly. I get small flare ups, but it is very under control with triderma and I use the cleanser as well, they are fantastic!</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I had a chemical burn to my face and when it started to heal, my face was red and peeling. This worked wonders. Very delicate to skin and cleans good.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product through a sample that came in my box of Tri Derma Facial Redness Repair.  The two products together seem to have minimized my rosacea better than anything I have used to date.  After spending hundreds of dollars on oral perscriptions, two dermatologists and lots of frustration...maybe I have finally hit on a combination that works!  I&#x27;m ordering both from Amazon today.</li>
    <li> I developed rosacea a few years ago and nothing really worked on it. I just tried to cover it with makeup. After trying some of the more expensive, brand-name treatments like Eucerin, I picked up TriDerma&#x27;s redness repair lotion on a whim one day in the drugstore. It works so well for me. I apply it in the morning and evening after washing my face and it has done such a wonderful job with the redness that it is possible for me to go out without makeup and still feel confident. I hate greasy formulas or those that feel thin and don&#x27;t moisturize sufficiently. This definitely moisturizes my skin without it feeling greasy. My skin is soft and dewy. I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with my facial cleanser so I purchased TriDerma&#x27;s facial redness cleanser and it works great in tandem with this and my skin has improved even more! I should also add that I have very sensitive skin and this has never irritated my skin and really keeps flare-ups to a minimum!!</li>
    <li> use this in conjunction wth the facial redness repair and it awesome.  you only need a little bit and it will moisuturize your whole face for the whole day.</li>
    <li> If you have tried everything but this, you must try this. Not only is this cleanser great for my sensitive Rosacea skin but my 11 year old son who is starting to break out has also benefited. Use with Facial Redness Repair, not just for redness but for improving skin and helping irritation to heal.  A little goes a long way so it lasts!</li>
    <li> I was AMAZED that this had added fragrance! For sensitive skin? It also is very drying. Not a fan. I returned this.</li>
    <li> My face frequently feels hot and looks flushed (Menopause? - life in hot florida? - stress?).  Feels and looks much better with a wash with this product.  Gentle and foamy without an overpowering scent, nondrying, non-greasy, seems to keep any blemishes away.  Don&#x27;t use it all the time but now that I&#x27;ve run out I&#x27;m missing it after only a few days.  However, Amazon seller&#x27;s prices are too much.  Check locally.</li>
    <li> I love triderma facial redness repair.  It is the only product I have found that eliminates my ruddy cheeks and nose.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin... so I just assumed this wouldn&#x27;t work (like most cleansers!) but I was wrong. I love this face wash and will continue to order it.</li>
    <li> Seemed to help.hard to find a product for sensitive face.I use it every otherday</li>
    <li> Great product. I have been using it for about a month and it is a great cleanser that cleans off all my makeup and feels very soothing. Does not sting my eyes as I totally lather up including removing eye shadow and mascara My face feels very clean after I wash with this cleanser.  I apply Prosacea Gel after I wash. As soon as gel is dry, I pat on a firming lotion over face. I can say that my redness is greatly reduced, have not had any break out for a long time (acne or the rosacea pustules). I am actually wearing my foundation less heavily...my face is that much better!</li>
