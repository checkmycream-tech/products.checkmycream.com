<li> Good dog treats that kill bad breath.</li>
<li> Try cutting them in half length wise - otherwise my little daisy swallows them whole</li>
<li> Giving out one a day doesn&#x27;t last too long.  </li>
<li> many dental products are just too tough for their little teeth.  </li>
<li> I really didn&#x27;t mean to buy the sticks.  </li>
<li> who has a very delicate digestive system, absolutely loves them with no adverse effects.</li>
<li> He is very picky and has a small mouth but looks forward to this cleaning every day and cleans every bit up!!</li>
<li> This is much easier than trying to brush his teeth which we both disliked doing!!!</li>
<li> It is very difficult to clean a small Yorkie&#x27;s back teeth and my two 5 lb.</li>
<li> We cut them in half for her.  </li>
<li> so I cut the treats in half for her, she likes them too.</li>

    <li> Best dental treats I have found for my dachshunds.  They hate having teeth brushed and many dental products are just too tough for their little teeth.  These brushless toothpaste treats are awesome.  Right size and I have even cut them into pieces for a breath freshener/dental mini treat.  Smell great, not too hard, takes awhile to eat.  I recommend these to everyone I see including my veterinarian.  Make you pet happy and their breath and teeth much sweeter and healthier, try these!</li>
    <li> Good dog treats that kill bad breath. For real!</li>
    <li> Best dog treat.  My dog loves these and his teeth are beautiful.</li>
    <li> My girls love these and I like the natural ingredients! I do freeze them as the bag suggests.</li>
    <li> It seems to work as advertised. My dog a 13 lb shih tzu  who has a very delicate digestive system, absolutely loves them with no adverse effects. She thinks they are her daily treat.</li>
    <li> I have tried every type of &amp;#34;greenie&amp;#34; for my Boston Terrier and he just never liked them.  Would start to eat the treat and then just leave it behind.  Not with these Ark Naturals though.  He devours them!!!!  I may need to freeze them to help him slow down the eating process.  Thanks so much for making a product that works well and tastes great for him.</li>
    <li> our pooches love them</li>
    <li> I have a Boston terrier and she loves most things so I wasn’t surprised when she grabbed this, ran to her bed and started eating; I was surprised how fast she came back wanting more. Really good product, next time I’ll pay attention to the size of the bone.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased to find this tooth cleaning product. It is very difficult to clean a small Yorkie&#x27;s back teeth and my two 5 lb. dogs beg for these after their meals. They even got their first. &amp;#34;Good&amp;#34; review at the last Vet visit for clean back teeth&lt;br /&gt;As well as front teeth. Ingenious invention in my opinion, I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These might be good for other dogs, but my Maltese​ throws up a gooey, green mess after eating them.</li>
    <li> I actually cut these into 4ths as my 4 lb yorkie poo can&#x27;t chew them otherwise.  He knows where they are kept and goes nuts scratching at the cupboard trying to get them.  A great purchase</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t mean to buy the sticks.  Giving out one a day doesn&#x27;t last too long.  My dogs seems to like them.  I think they work fine.</li>
    <li> My dogs love these chewy sticks and I continue to hope that it works to keep their teeth and gums healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NY etailers has the best price so far.</li>
    <li> My 6 lb yorkie loves these Ark Naturals to clean his teeth and breath. He is very picky and has a small mouth but looks forward to this cleaning every day and cleans every bit up!! This is much easier than trying to brush his teeth which we both disliked doing!!!</li>
    <li> My beagle loves them.</li>
    <li> She goes crazy for them. She gets one when we leave the house, and instead of whining like she used to, she grabs it and runs to her bed and ignores us. It&#x27;s like she wants us to leave now. I&#x27;m not kidding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her teeth actually do look better. She is 25 lbs and has a sensitive stomach - greenies caused terrible stomach distress - so I&#x27;m glad I found something we can both like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They smell good, like apples and spice. I know they&#x27;re expensive but they&#x27;ve been worth it.</li>
    <li> Is really helping to improve my dog&#x27;s bad breath. It&#x27;s not completely gone yet but is better. I&#x27;ve been using them for about one month. I have a miniature dachshund so I cut the treats in half for her, she likes them too.</li>
    <li> I buy tons of this!! My dogs love it and it&#x27;s great deal here on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, my dog was not impressed with these.</li>
    <li> Love them love them love them although they do tend to constipate the smaller dogs in my household.  Try cutting them in half length wise - otherwise my little daisy swallows them whole so they don&#x27;t work as well on her :(</li>
    <li> Been giving these to our 8 lb toy poodle almost daily for 2 years.  We cut them in half for her.  We brush her teeth many days still and give her this after we brush, but with a new human baby in the house, many days this is all she gets! They keep her teeth looking great and breath smelling great!!  We also put OraVet Plaque Prevention Gel on her gums once a week.  2 years ago we got her teeth cleaned for the first time and she had to get 14 teeth pulled - I felt HORRIBLE and so we have been consistent ever since... So great to know her teeth are still being taken care of well even though we are manually brushing as religiously right now. Her teeth are still doing awesome and have not been professionally cleaned since. Highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> My dog loves this.  It seems to have helped her breath also.</li>
    <li> My dog does not like having her teeth brushed.&lt;br /&gt;However, with the Ark Breathless Brushless Toothpaste pieces,&lt;br /&gt;they do all the work for me, and my dog loves them. And her teeth look fine.&lt;br /&gt;She really looks forward to getting her special treat!&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> My dog loves these and his teeth look very healthy</li>
    <li> Good product, seems to clean dogs teeth.  Dogs love it.</li>
