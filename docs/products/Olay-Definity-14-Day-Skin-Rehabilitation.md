### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>that&#x27;s good!!!</li>
      <li>Wonderful.</li>
      <li>The packaging is excellent - airtight and opaque, which preserves the integrity of the anti-oxidant ingredients.  </li>
      <li>and I especially enjoyed the mask.  </li>
      <li>My face felt magnificently supple and luminous.  </li>
      <li>and this was the best price I could find for the kit ($21.87).</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s wonderful on my skin.</li>
      <li>It is an impressive regime.</li>
      <li>The best part about it is, I wasn&#x27;t wearing any make up</li>
      <li>The scent was very very pleasant.  </li>
      <li>It is a very good brand</li>
      <li>I think I was just avoiding it because it seems like an incredible PITA</li>
      <li>It did a great job conditioning</li>
      <li>great.</li>
      <li>Oh, almost forgot my allergies are really happy.  </li>
      <li>LOL.  </li>
      <li>This is a great system.</li>
      <li>are both happy.  </li>
      <li>The product is just great.</li>
      <li>After that I had great difficulty finding another product I like.  </li>
      <li>LOL.  </li>
      <li>the bright side, it is inoffensive in it&#x27;s scent.</li>
      <li>Still, if you want to take a couple weeks to pamper yourself, inexpensively, and don&#x27;t mind throwing out 95% of what you paid for, this would be a good choice.</li>
      <li>My skin looked good, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I loved this product.  </li>
      <li>I use BHA products because they are good exfoliators and also help keep blackheads under control.  </li>
      <li>But I would imagine using any good skin product for 14 days would result in softer skin.</li>
      <li>I damaged and in a good package.</li>
      <li>The mask is good.</li>
      <li>Anyway it&#x27;s one of those products I&#x27;ll remember to use for when I need to make a good impression.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s that good.  </li>
      <li>but I do believe that good skin care can start at any age.</li>
      <li>Good product, fast delivery, great price!</li>
      <li>That was a wonderful end to a pretty painless treatment.    </li>
      <li>That was a wonderful end to a pretty painless treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am certainly glad I did not have to pay for it!</li>
      <li>This 14-day product is amazing.</li>
      <li>Just a nice, easy-to-use, two week renewal regimen.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles on my own face --</li>
      <li>Did every days treatment have to come in it&#x27;s own dispenser?</li>
      <li>Not 21, but nice for a woman of my age.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, the truth is that at the end of it all, I saw no transformation of any kind brought about by the chemicals in this formula.</li>
      <li>that really, the one tube was a perfect amount.</li>
      <li>I have been happy using that for about a month before I got this special Skin Rehab kit.    </li>
      <li>So, I think I have become a new fan of this wonderful product.  </li>
      <li>mask was okay, but I honestly prefer clay/mud masks out of a tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I used it before and it was more effective.  </li>
      <li>as it clearly did for me LOL!</li>
      <li>There may be better products out there, but I really liked this one.&lt;br</li>
      <li>exactly as the instructions say and it works great.  </li>
      <li>I think its VERY VERY important to STAY OUT out</li>
      <li>but it was very light and non-greasy</li>
      <li>The cream is more oil based, which does not work well with anyone who has problems with oily skin.  </li>
      <li>I love the mask, I do wish I could buy it separately.  </li>
      <li>I used Olay&#x27;s Regenerist line for quite a while - most of the winter months of 2007-08 and the spring thereafter.  </li>
      <li>Phase two was OK.</li>
      <li>This product was ok.</li>
      <li>My skin glowed a bit more and it was a lot more moisturized than before.</li>
      <li>My skin looked and felt wonderful after 2 weeks of using this...and only has to be used every 3 months.  </li>
      <li>A perfect facial.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Phase 1: This was probably my favorite phase.</li>
      <li>Love the product the price&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
      <li>Over all, my skin seems more luminous, evenly toned, and smoother.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I was fairly satisfied with it</li>
      <li>I am also considering purchasing some more products from this line.  </li>

      <li>The recommended time is to leave the mask for 15 mins or more.  </li>
      <li>The recommended time is to leave the mask for 15 mins or more.  </li>
      <li>the morning before the facial mask, I used Olay Regenerist Microdermabrasion kit and found really excellent results from that.</li>
      <li>It actually became a wonderful anticipated moment every night being able to sniff the lingering scent while watching television.  </li>
      <li>\\&quot;OK, but</li>
      <li>MY skin was refreshed and plumped up and more youthful.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite skin care product, from the Olay line, and those looking for any over the counter \\&quot;miracles\\&quot; better keep on with the hunt.</li>
      <li>Because it&#x27;s so hit or miss, I&#x27;d first buy it from a place with a \\&quot;satifacition guaranteed\\&quot; policy well spelled out, or on a really good sale.  </li>
      <li>Furthermore, my skin was becoming more moisturized than ever before.&lt;br</li>
      <li>First, I have to say I&#x27;ve been blessed with good skin.  </li>
      <li>Even though, my face continued to feel great and look remarkably clear even though it was that time of the month.    </li>
      <li>Even though, my face continued to feel great and look remarkably clear even though it was that time of the month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Having worn SPF every day since I was around 13 years old, I still take great care of my skin, stay hydrated, use quality products -</li>
      <li>My daily moisturizer was not moisturzing my skin as good as I would have liked it.</li>
      <li>+ dollars for more full fledged kits.  </li>
      <li>Glad I didnt pay the full price for this.</li>
      <li>The regimen is a 14 day skin rehabilitation that should detoxify and eliminate fine lines and skin</li>
      <li>After all we didn&#x27;t get those fine lines and wrinkles in 14 days so how can you cure them in that amount of time.  </li>
      <li>I was just hoping for a reduction in fine lines and some pregnancy discoloration.  </li>
      <li>The scent again was very pleasant but different from the first.  </li>
      <li>After going through the 14 day program I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference.</li>
      <li>That is actually a great thing opposed to not having enough.  </li>
      <li>The three different products that are in this set all have a great smell</li>
      <li>Let me start out by saying that I have been blessed with great skin, am pushing 40 and have started to see a wrinkle here and there and several \\&quot;age or</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth my face was</li>
      <li>So, I bought this 14 day kit because it fit the bill.</li>
      <li>My skin was in pretty good shape (thanks to Olay Pro-X!)</li>
      <li>So far so good though.</li>
      <li>I did not find it to be small and the more I gently tugged, I was able to form my face perfectly.  </li>
      <li>It was very fun and felt like a spa night at home.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I am 45 years old and have very few lines, but this is because I have used moisturizers and masks on my face since I was 16 years old.  I started out using Avon, then had to move to Clinique, but when I hit 30 Clinique was not working for me any longer and made my face too dry.  I then moved to Biotherm, but they moved out of the U.S.  After that I had great difficulty finding another product I like.  You see I am a little fanatical about wrinkles.  I do not want wrinkles in any shape or form.  I do not willingly let people cut on me, so there is a 99.5% chance I will never have a face-lift.  I have spent a lot of money trying everything in Macy&#x27;s and have never been happy.  Now I have a variation of Oil of Olay and my pocketbook and my skin are both happy.  Oh, almost forgot my allergies are really happy.  I have used this particular product exactly as the instructions say and it works great.  I have revitalized and refreshed skin at the end of the 14 days.  I love the mask, I do wish I could buy it separately.  I really like to use a facial mask once or twice a week, but have found none in the Oil of Olay line.  I use the Total Effects line with the exception of the eye cream.  I use the Pro X eye cream.  I use the Definity 14 day treatment twice a year.  The Total Effects has a non-perfume version of their daily moisturizer with SPF 15 which works wonders.  I used to spend close to $300 each time I had to replace all of my products, with Oil of Olay, I now spend about $100 every time I need to replace them all.  Oh, did I mention that I&#x27;m 45 years old and most people think I am in my mid 30&#x27;s.  Thank you Oil of Olay for making a product that works for me and that I can actually afford.  I do wish the Pro X line did not cost so much though, because one day I will be forced to move up the ladder like everyone else.</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for me.  It was easy to pack daily packs for travelling, but I saw no difference at the end of the 14 day period.</li>
    <li> I am someone who is still young but I do believe that good skin care can start at any age. Before using this product, my skin was extremely dry and sun-damaged. My daily moisturizer was not moisturzing my skin as good as I would have liked it. So here is what I thought about each Phase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phase 1: This was probably my favorite phase. From the moment I put it on, I could feel it working. Since my skin was so dry, I got that good kind of pain that can only come from dry skin being refreshed. I thought one tube might be a lot for my face but it was very light and non-greasy that really, the one tube was a perfect amount. Furthermore, my skin was becoming more moisturized than ever before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phase 2: Phase two was OK. It had a very silky feeling to it. The only downside is that you have to spread the lotion extremely fast or else it tends to be left on your fingers much of the residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phase 3: I will admit that I did not get to enjoy Phase 3 as much as I wanted. I was busy with a few things so I was only able to leave it on for so long. however, this is a very nice moisturizing mask that if possible, is great to lie down on the bed and just leave the mask on for a long time. It did a great job conditioning my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I did see that some of my sun-damage was gone. My skin glowed a bit more and it was a lot more moisturized than before. This is a great system.</li>
    <li> I have used the first 5 treatments as specified. I have had more breakouts than when I was in high school. I wanted to wait to write this until I finished the product, but I will probably not finish it. I have not noticed any difference so far except the breakouts. I have oily skin, in my early 40s,large pores and minimal wrinkles/sun damage, fair skin tone. Maybe this just isnt for my skin type? I felt it was worth warning someone else with similar skin type. Glad I didnt pay the full price for this. I found it on clearance at a mass retailer that I will not name.:0)</li>
    <li> This product seems hit or miss.  For whatever reason, this product gave me great, visible results upon first use, and I&#x27;m not easily impressed with skin care products. Having worn SPF every day since I was around 13 years old, I still take great care of my skin, stay hydrated, use quality products - yet it appears my skin was lacking what&#x27;s in the Definity line.  Glucosamine?  Anyway it&#x27;s one of those products I&#x27;ll remember to use for when I need to make a good impression.  It&#x27;s that good.  Because it&#x27;s so hit or miss, I&#x27;d first buy it from a place with a \\&quot;satifacition guaranteed\\&quot; policy well spelled out, or on a really good sale.  You can also call Olay and get $7 off coupons.  And no, I don&#x27;t work for Olay!</li>
    <li> I have become a lot more interested in my skin, now that I&#x27;ve hit 30. I&#x27;m trying to reverse some of the skin damage I&#x27;ve done with sun and such.  Also, I like to pamper myself sometimes...  So, I bought this 14 day kit because it fit the bill. I simply adore the feel and scent of the lotions for the first 7 days. I also think it did brighten my complexion a little. The second week was alright, though I didn&#x27;t see a huge difference and let me just say: the cloth mask with the serum on it for the last nigh: FREAKY. I couldn&#x27;t look at myself in the mirror without laughing (Friday the 13th, anyone?). BUT: my face was extremely smooth the next morning, and I actually squeezed out the cloth before throwing it away and smeared the \\&quot;left-over\\&quot; serum on my neck,etc.   So, though this 14 day kit might not make you look like you had a face-lift and laser treatment on your sun spots, it made me feel refreshed and like I was intensively doing something for my skin.  I would buy this again (but probably not every 3 months, or as recommended), but really it was more of an inexpensive spa treat for me than a hard-core tool to improve skin tone and look.  I must admit, the morning before the facial mask, I used Olay Regenerist Microdermabrasion kit and found really excellent results from that. So, that&#x27;s probably the route I&#x27;m going to take from now on.</li>
    <li> Update 3/28- I have used Olay&#x27;s Definity UV foam during the day, lotion in the evening and the cleanser since last July. I liked them all and thought they are effective at lightening my sun spots due to a California trip, and they keep my skin supple and reduce any sun damage.    The first five days I used this kit, I did not feel significant improvements, may be just a little. By day 7, people started to complement how young I look. And indeed I can see a noticable difference in the color and feel of my face. So now I am giving it five stars.</li>
    <li> I wish they would encourage people to use this product in conjunction with an at-home microdermabrasion kit.  I am an avid user of microdermabrasion and was suffering withdrawals while using this Olay lotion system.  The first 7 days of vials did lighten my skin and clear up some discolorations, so there must be some skin bleaching going on.  Also, my skin was VERY dry for the first 7 days because it is a cream to cause exfoliation and this was very difficult for me not to grab the microdermabrasion tool and scrub off that dead skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second 7 day set of vials were much better and did not dry my skin out like the first 7 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask was okay, but I honestly prefer clay/mud masks out of a tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this set 4 stars because it did do a phenomenal job at evening out my skin color and clearing up the discoloration from old blemishes, but in terms of fine lines and wrinkles, I would recommend people try an at-home microdermabrasion kit, like those of Neutrogena.  Combine the Olay Definity kit with the microdermabrasion of Neutrogena and BINGO!  A perfect facial.  I will use this again in tandem with my Neutrogena kit next time.  This product is definitely worth a try to even out skin tone!</li>
    <li> So, I think I have become a new fan of this wonderful product.  Upon reading the instructions on the box it states that this product should be used once every 3 months for the full 14 day period.  The regimen is a 14 day skin rehabilitation that should detoxify and eliminate fine lines and skin discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little backround... I go and have Microdermabrasion done every few months and use the Dermologica brand of cleansers, moisturizer and scrub.  At night I use a Guinot brand of moisturizer.  I have problematic skin that has since subsided since the microdermabrasion.  In the summer, I have the dreaded T-Zone situation and in the winter my face dries out terribly and flakes.  I suffer from clogged pores as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a nice hard plastic container holding all the vials for the necessary treatment.  I am trying to find another way to reuse the plastic container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nights 1-7 is the \\&quot;detox\\&quot; phase of the treatment that is supposed to ignite the skins exfoliation.  The vial had a lot of cream... too much for my face, so I continued down to my neck.  The scent was very very pleasant.  It actually became a wonderful anticipated moment every night being able to sniff the lingering scent while watching television.  My face felt magnificently supple and luminous.  The dry winter skin was no longer visible; my husband even commented on how soft and supple my face appeared and felt in bed.  It was sticky and my skin drank it up.  I began to see some discoloration begin to even out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nights 8-13 is the \\&quot;deep recovery\\&quot; phase of the treatment that is supposed to hydrate and help the skin recover from past stresses.  The vials are again the same size and a lot of cream.  That is actually a great thing opposed to not having enough.  The scent again was very pleasant but different from the first.  My face felt just a bit greasier with this phase after application.  I found my face slightly sticking to my pillow (not cute when you have dogs and cat that lay on your bed).  Even though, my face continued to feel great and look remarkably clear even though it was that time of the month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final phase is the \\&quot;reviving\\&quot; mask that is supposed to give the skin a boost of rehabilitating moisture.  I am a claustrophobic person and I did not find this mask restricting in the least bit!  It was very fun and felt like a spa night at home.  The mask is in a foil lined pouch already saturated with 5x the conditioners of a typical lotion.  You do not need to add water to the mask.  Remove the mask, unfold and apply to face.  You must slow grasp and stretch the edges to make it fit properly.  I did not find it to be small and the more I gently tugged, I was able to form my face perfectly.  You end up looking a bit like Jason from the horror movie LOL.  The recommended time is to leave the mask for 15 mins or more.  I opted to go for 45 minutes while watching some recorded shows.  That was a wonderful end to a pretty painless treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend, as I will be purchasing as Summer rolls around.  At first I was going to come on here saying it didn&#x27;t do much, but now that I am no longer using, my face doesn&#x27;t feel supple and bright anymore.  I am also considering purchasing some more products from this line.  As far as the wrinkles, I am 28 and besides some fine forehead lines, they were less pronounced during the treatment.d).

    <li> This 14 day treatment comes in three parts, but it&#x27;s all in one little tray for you. There are 7 tubes in the first row of the tray, just twist the caps off and put on before bed, they give you more than enough to cover your face. After you apply to your face will need to allow for a few moments of drying before laying your head on the pillow. The next day I could immediately feel that my face was super soft and hydrated. It was a very noticeable difference in texture. I couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth my face was and I kept feeling it.&lt;br /&gt;The second row is the same type of tube but a different consistency inside. After you complete all the tubes there is a final step, it is a mask, but you don&#x27;t have to mix anything, or rinse anything off, you just take it out of the pouch, put it right on your face and then throw it away. It&#x27;s been about two weeks since I&#x27;ve used the product but my skin still feels dewy soft and smooth. That tells me that it is not just temporary relief but that it&#x27;s actually doing something down deep, that lasts. It is an impressive regime.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still working on the 14 day program and I have to say that I am actually noticing a change in the appearance of my skin. I don&#x27;t know that it will last, but I&#x27;m noticing that the fine little lines are not there (or are at least not as noticeable.    I&#x27;m curious what this product will cost retail and if it will produce long term results. So far so good though.</li>
    <li> I used Olay&#x27;s Regenerist line for quite a while - most of the winter months of 2007-08 and the spring thereafter.  Then I went off it for a while, during which time I experimented with other ($$$) brands.  But then I was poking around the Olay website and took their new \\&quot;find your skincare regimen\\&quot; questionnaire and took it, and certain products in the Definity line were recommended instead.    The regular jar night cream from Definity is a thick cream, a weird color (almost a dirty beige) in a 1.7-ounce jar.  I have been happy using that for about a month before I got this special Skin Rehab kit.    The first seven tubes of the Skin Rehab stuff look just like the regular jar stuff I was using before.  The tubes are convenient, but this causes excess packaging issues which may offend some people.  The second batch of tubes is a purer cream color.  Neither of these felt any different from a rich nighttime moisturizer.    My skin does suffer from discoloration in places and I didn&#x27;t notice this product changing that.  The moisturizing mask is a neat thing to try and feels very nice on the face, but again, I can get the same overall nice results cleansing with the Regenerist microdermabrasion kit followed by the Definity (or even the Regenerist) night moisturizer.  So, this kit seems like a bit of a waste, and I probably won&#x27;t get it again.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve been interested in trying one of the new skin-care kits available, Olay&#x27;s Skin Rehab is a good place to start. You get three different products to use, in order, over a two-week period. At the end your face, if it&#x27;s like mine, will feel refreshed and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First is a week-long detoxifying routine, followed by six days of \\&quot;deep recovery.\\&quot; You use pre-measured lotions in little plastic containers. Finally, you moisturize with a cloth mask that you leave on your face for at least 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it&#x27;s all over, I felt like I did something special for myself, very girly. There may be better products out there, but I really liked this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only missed five stars because of the terrible waste of plastic in the packaging. I felt guilty even as my face felt happy.</li>
    <li> Okay,I admit I&#x27;ve been neglecting my skin the last couple of years even though I&#x27;m into my early 50&#x27;s and should know better. I decided to take some action and purchased this product.  I am amazed at the difference in my skin--there was a particular acne-like bump on my right cheek that had been there for at least a couple of YEARS and I thought it had something to do with aging and that it would be there forever, but, alas, this treatment caused whatever it was to come to the surface and it&#x27;s now almost entirely GONE.  Overall, this treatment also cleared up other imperfections and brightened my skin. I can hardly wait to go through this treatment again but, shucks, instructions say you can only do it every three months :)</li>
    <li> Let me start out by saying that I have been blessed with great skin, am pushing 40 and have started to see a wrinkle here and there and several \\&quot;age or sun spots\\&quot;.  I chose this product mainly to hopefully lighten some of the spots but alas, this product did not deliver on it&#x27;s promise to fade age spots.  It did, however, in the first 7 days of treatment, make my skin a tad brighter and certainly smoother.  The three different products that are in this set all have a great smell and I especially enjoyed the mask.  If Olay packaged just the mask itself, I would buy it as I think the masks would be great in the summer if you got a little too much sun on your face or in the cold of winter for dry, chapped skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this Olay was just \\&quot;OK\\&quot; for me...</li>
    <li> I received this product through Amazon Vine and was pleasantly surprised to see Olay there. It is a very good brand and I have used the regenerist serum before and thought it worked well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked this up and used it and it did make my face feel refreshed and worked pretty well. It comes with 7 capsules of first treatment to use then 7 to use after the first week. Also a hydrating mask that was nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that it was a pain to remember to put it on every night for those 2 weeks. Maybe it&#x27;s just me but I&#x27;d prefer something in a bigger bottle that you can just use when you want but it said to use this for a couple weeks straight daily to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was fairly satisfied with it but I much prefer regenerist serum to this. 3.5 stars.</li>
    <li> This 14-day product is amazing. It is well worth the time spent applying the product, which is minimal, as you will see your facial skin come alive. Your face will jump back through an \\&quot;Oil of Olay portal\\&quot; in time...I guess is what happens. And it does happen. Fourteen days to turn back time and see that you whom you remember, but thought that she was gone. So, why four-stars and not five? Oil of Olay, and, the entire facial and body care stuff providers need to remember that men use their products substantially more so now. And so, they need to more aware of the dislikes of men...like, scent, absorption, simplicity, and a version of the products in less feminine bottles. I&#x27;m sorry, but I just cannot get past the pretty, dainty bottles. Love a product line or not, I simply will not fill my bathroom with pretty pink bottles. That simple!</li>
    <li> I get so excited when there is an Olay product I haven&#x27;t tried.  I am sorry to say that I did not see any sustantial difference after this product was completel used.</li>
    <li> I have very significant dark patches in my face due to hormonal changes, so I bought this product hoping it would lighten those.  It certainly did!  Actually, within the first couple of days I could see noticeable improvement.  I still have some discoloration, but the patches have lightened enough that I am very encouraged and generally feeling better about my appearance.  Over all, my skin seems more luminous, evenly toned, and smoother.  I intend to use this kit again in a few months to see if I can achieve further improvement.  I was a bit unhappy about all the packaging involved, and as another reviewer mentioned, wished I could find another practical use for the plastic framework that held all the tubes, but I&#x27;m not sure how they could re-design the packaging to ensure uncrushed tubes while using less plastic.  The amount of product in each tube was enough for me to treat face and decolletage without feeling like I was having to spread it too thin.</li>
    <li> Skin appearance did improve, but did not do a lot to get rid of wrinkles or dark spots. However, I am 67 and did not expect miracles.</li>
    <li> ANOTHER GUEST REVIEW BY \\&quot;MRS. KNOW IT ALL!!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This skin rehabilitation process takes place in three phases.  There are 7 nights of detoxifying the skin, 6 nights of revitalizing, and the last night is a skin mask.  After all, of those nights, I did not see a big enough transformation in my skin to warrant using this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first 7 nights, I did see a difference in my skin--it was less red and felt smoother.  Therefore, I was very pleased with this application and could not wait to move onto the next.  Well, the next 6 nights, I feel like I moved backwards.  The cream is more oil based, which does not work well with anyone who has problems with oily skin.  This process made my skin feel oily and in turn, I think it made me breakout more than I would have under normal skin care.  The last night is the skin mask, which I found to be cooling and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The PROS - There is enough cream in the tubes to share with your partner, or use half each night, saving the next half for the next day.  Then you would have unopened tubes to save for another application a few months later.  So, you can really get two applications out of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CONS - In the end, I did not see enough difference in my face to use this product again.  I also did not like the reaction my face had to the oily type cream.</li>
    <li> I used this product for the prescribed 14 days in a row ~ it was fairly easy to remember to substitute these tubes for the oil-free hydrating gel I normally put on my face after cleaning it, every night.  The product was nice: I have normal skin that is a tad dry, and this product worked out just great for me...I used the tubes on my face each night, and never had any excess: I would just rub it all in &amp; wait for it to soak up &amp; ended up using it all.  Anyone who has oily skin may find that there is too much product in the tubes, but for my slightly dry normal skin, it was just perfect if I let it soak in!      The first tubes were nice: a thick consistency kind of like a lotion, and the second set of tubes reminded me of conditioner for my face: and both smelled very nice!  The mask I really liked, and would like to purchse seperate to use once in awhie: it was cooling &amp; nice, and I laid back &amp; took a little &#x27;nap&#x27; while it was working!    I am 30 years old, and have a few wrinkles on my forehead, smile lines, etc. and I did see a difference in them!  I would buy &amp; use this product again when I have some extra money, and do a few times a year (as recommended): I wasn&#x27;t blown away by the product being &#x27;absolutely amazing&#x27; or anything, but it was a nice little regime and I DID see some improvement on my face, so I would be willing to try it again &amp; see how it goes if I keep using this product a few more times ~ recommended for those who want to help the lines on their face or to do something to get themselves into the habit of putting moisturizer/cream on their face every night!</li>
    <li> Olay Definity 14 Day Skin Rehab consists of 7 ampoules of \\&quot;detoxifying\\&quot; treatment, 6 ampoules and 1 mask of \\&quot;rehabilitating\\&quot; treatment.  The packaging is excellent - airtight and opaque, which preserves the integrity of the anti-oxidant ingredients.  Otherwise, there is very little about this product that is special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first phase contains salicylic acid (BHA) and vitamin E.  The second phase includes niacinamide and acetyl glucosamine.  The mask is pretty much the same as the second phase, but contains a greater amount of humectant ingredients.  I was unable to determine if the salicylic acid product is an effective formulation.  It should be 1-2% and with a pH of 3-4.  I don&#x27;t know the percentage, and don&#x27;t have a pH test kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The products also contain mica and titanium dioxide, which leave a nice glow to the skin, but that is only a cosmetic affect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no adverse effects from this product.  I use BHA products because they are good exfoliators and also help keep blackheads under control.  If you like the concept of this product, you can maintain an everyday protocol of exfoliation plus niacinamide by using [[ASIN:B000RKVAPC Clearasil Acne Fighting Cleansing Wipes 32 wipes]] or [[ASIN:B000OLE7V8 Neutrogena Acne Stress Control, 3-in-1 Hydrating Acne Treatment,  2-Ounce Packages (Pack of 3)]] (keep both of these products away from the eye area), plus [[ASIN:B0000CC64W Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum, Concentrated Amino-Peptide Complex, Fragrance Free - 1.7 fl oz]], or [[ASIN:B000092OX4 Olay Regenerist Regenerating Lotion with UV protection. Packaging May Vary,  -2.5 fl oz]] for daytime.  Please note that both AHA and BHA can cause temporary skin irritation.  You may wish to start using these types of products every other day.</li>
    <li> My skin apparently does not need this much rehabbing!  I tried one tube of this one night, and discovered putting the whole tube on my face was impossible.  So, I put most of one tube on, and it left my face very greasy looking...even the next day, after I washed my face.  My foundation did not go on well either.  It was quite a shocking difference from using the Olay ProX creams, which I have been using for over a month.  I went back to the ProX the next night.  Maybe I&#x27;ll try the Rehab Definity again when the ProX runs out. Maybe if you stick with it as instructed, it does what it claims to do. I do not know, but I know I am never going to try to put an entire tube on my face again, as instructed.  It is too much and too greasy!</li>
    <li> This product was ok but it caused some breakouts on my cheeks where I do not normally have issues. I did not really notice any changes in my skin after the treatment except for the breakouts. I&#x27;ve used other Olay products with better success but this was my first attempt at something like this. Probably won&#x27;t be trying any other brands or types like this again.</li>
    <li> If you have a good bit of time on your hands and a desire to devote much of it to what amounts to a virtually useless exercise, this product might be for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the bright side, it is inoffensive in it&#x27;s scent. On the negative side, it did ultimately become irritating to my skin. I must confess, however, that I do have allergies, and another consumer in search of a beauty miracle might not have this reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the truth is that at the end of it all, I saw no transformation of any kind brought about by the chemicals in this formula.</li>
    <li> My skin was in pretty good shape (thanks to Olay Pro-X!) already, but this looked interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit is nice-looking, comes in 13 little tubes in a stand, with a mask clipped to the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each tube has more than enough moisturizer for your face, neck, and even your hands if you like.  Phase One is very lightweight, non-greasy and pinkish-tan colored.  Mildly perfumed.  Phase Two is thicker and pearly white.  The mask is white felt soaked in a translucent goo.  All phases worked well for moisturizing, though I found the mask a little inconvenient since it takes 15+ minutes.  I&#x27;d rather use that in the daytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it was entertaining and certainly did no harm.  It&#x27;s hard to test sun damage in early spring, and I was using a superior product already, so I didn&#x27;t expect to see anything dramatic, and I didn&#x27;t.  My skin looked good, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint is that the rehab kit is very wasteful in that it produces a lot of plastic trash.  All the tubes and the big rack to hold them.  Still, if you want to take a couple weeks to pamper yourself, inexpensively, and don&#x27;t mind throwing out 95% of what you paid for, this would be a good choice.</li>
    <li> I bought it at Marsh....for 9.99 and I am in day 9 but it seems like I might have a reaction to it. My face looks bumpy and it feels sensitive to the touch. I will tell you that any dark spots I have from resent acne, are fading away ( one week before treatment) acne scars are fading now that i&#x27;m in day 9....that&#x27;s good!!! I will continue to use..I think its VERY VERY important to STAY OUT out SUN- if I use sun block I break out because my skin is sensitive right- my recomen...stay out of it.&lt;br /&gt;avoid heavy sweat and make-up....</li>
    <li> This really re-hydrates and plumps up those fine lines.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at Marshall&#x27;s at a discount price. I don&#x27;t have any skin problems, I was just curious and wanted to try it. To make a long story short, I finished the 14 days and didn&#x27;t notice any significant difference. When I went to work, everybody kept complimenting me and telling me that I was \\&quot;glowing\\&quot;. The best part about it is, I wasn&#x27;t wearing any make up and I am a 37 year old woman. I think this product helped but I have always worked hard at keeping my skin in good shape. Though this is not a miracle in a bottle, I don&#x27;t see the harm in using this treatment every once in a while along with your regular routine. It can help give you that extra boost as it clearly did for me LOL!</li>
    <li> After going through the 14 day program I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference. But I&#x27;m not sure that 14 days is actually long enough, it should probably be for at least 28 days. After all we didn&#x27;t get those fine lines and wrinkles in 14 days so how can you cure them in that amount of time.  On the plus side my skin does seem to be more soft and hydrated so it did it&#x27;s job in at least that aspect, and I really enjoyed the nightly routine and pleasant fragrance. Bottom line I will probably try it again next winter when my skin needs extra care. Otherwise I&#x27;ll just stick to the regenerist.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used too many moisturizer products, so I can&#x27;t compare too much. This seems pretty comparable to the other one I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s nice to have individually packaged doses. Though one wonders whether having so much throw-away packaging (the tubes, stand and such) is in any way environmentally friendly. Probably not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as efficacy, my hands started pretty dry and leathery, bordering on wrinkly (being jut under 30, they shouldn&#x27;t be like that and it had me a bit worried). Don&#x27;t know whether it was due to a new fat-free diet, delayed sun damage from a trip to Hawaii or the hard water in the new house we just moved to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any event, since I&#x27;ve been using the stuff my hands seem to be back to a bit more \\&quot;normal\\&quot; condition, with skin that snaps back in place and doesn&#x27;t look wrinkly / leather when my fingers are straight and the skin is loose (as opposed to when the fist is clenched and the skin is taught and you can&#x27;t tell the skin is dry / leathery).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I&#x27;m not quite sure whether the change in my hands is due solely to the moisturizer, change in diet (I&#x27;ve been somewhat inadvertently getting a bit more fat in the diet, which may have helped with the dry skin problems) or drinking more water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s due at least in part if not largely to the Olay Skin Rehab stuff. It seems like it works better if you apply it little by little and let it soak in, rather than applying it all at once and getting a more greasy feeling. Either way, I&#x27;ve noticed a few times that after applying the little tube in its entirety it DOES leave either a slightly greasy feeling or a slightly sticky feeling on the skin, where the skin doesn&#x27;t quite slide smoothly anymore. You can definitely tell it&#x27;s there when on the hands... But since I used it before bed, I generally didn&#x27;t notice it while I was sleeping and it may have soaked in or rubbed off overnight, so I didn&#x27;t notice it in the morning either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it&#x27;s a mixed bag from me. I don&#x27;t know whether it works better than any other intensive therapy moisturizer on the market. It did leave something of a \\&quot;not normal\\&quot; feeling on my hands after use. Be it greasy or just slightly \\&quot;sticky.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably just go back to using the other bottle of moisturizer once this stuff is gone.r than any other intensive therapy moisturizer on the market. It did leave something of a \\&quot;not normal\\&quot; feeling on my hands after use. Be it greasy or just slightly \\&quot;sticky.\\&quot;    I&#x27;ll probably just go back to using the other bottle of moisturizer once this stuff is gone.</li>
    <li> Other than my skin being softer, I really did not notice any change from using this product.  I am certainly glad I did not have to pay for it!</li>
    <li> The little tubes of lotion in their plastic rack appealed to me aesthetically, like lining up crayons or getting a gold star every day for good work.  Given how expensive the lotions are, it was good to have measured doses, because I probably would have skimped, when they expect you to be more generous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 7-day detoxify routine was followed by a 6-day \\&quot;deep recovery\\&quot; regimen.  They didn&#x27;t seem that different to me, except that the deep recovery lotion was so lovely, a pearlescent white, I might have kept using it just because it LOOKS like it&#x27;s doing something special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final treatment is a cloth mask saturated with special moisturizer.  You plaster it to your entire face and leave it on for 15 minutes \\&quot;or more.\\&quot;  I left it on for nearly half an hour, by which time all the wrinkles in the mask had melted away and it was nicely fitted to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I didn&#x27;t see the noticeable improvement I had expected.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles on my own face -- puffiness and lines are more my problem -- so I suppose there wasn&#x27;t all that much to diminish. Or perhaps my skin is already very healthy, and there&#x27;s only so much one can do to turn back the clock for a middle-aged woman with combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to my daily face care routines, and I won&#x27;t bother with this one again.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve been on the fence for awhile interested in trying this type of skin care set Olay&#x27;s \\&quot;Skin Rehab\\&quot; 1-kit set provides an affordable level of entry to those not quite ready to spend $50+ dollars for more full fledged kits.  For about $15 or so you&#x27;re provided with 3 different skin care products that you&#x27;re to use in progressive stages over the course of 2 weeks.  While I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily say that i&#x27;m the target consumer for such a product (i&#x27;m not that wrinkly....yet!) I will say that within 10 days my skin did feel refreshed and the overall tone was certainly more balanced and &#x27;healthy&#x27; looking in contrast to it&#x27;s appearance when I first started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this set isn&#x27;t necessarily the best one on the market, for the price it really can&#x27;t hurt to try if you&#x27;re curious.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to be the internet&#x27;s official skin care petrie dish. I think I&#x27;ve tried just about everything, and I finally got around to Olay Definity.     I think I was just avoiding it because it seems like an incredible PITA (I hate skin treatments with multiple \\&quot;steps.\\&quot;)    In this case, I was wrong, but it&#x27;s easy to see why. Each of these little tubes is like a moisturizer, which they could easily put in a big tube or jar, but then you&#x27;d miss the idea that this system is doing something more than any number of other skin regiments do.     My skin is pretty normal, pretty rugged (takes a lot to make me break out), with a good texture. The product went on nicely, left my skin smooth.     Maybe you need to have really bad skin, but to be honest, I didn&#x27;t notice anything different with this vs. any number of other products. My aunt, who does have some serious wrinkles, liked it, but she, too, didn&#x27;t get what the deal was with all the tubes (\\&quot;Can&#x27;t they just put it in a jar?\\&quot;)    The final step when you&#x27;re done, the mask, was a nice touch.    If you can get it on sale and you have serious texture or wrinkle issues, this might be a good try for you. It&#x27;s not my favorite skin care product, from the Olay line, and those looking for any over the counter \\&quot;miracles\\&quot; better keep on with the hunt.</li>
    <li> I was able to get this kit for much less than sold online.  I followed the instructions for 14 days.  At the end of the time period, I saw NO difference in the texture, discoloration, or appearance of my skin.  Granted, my 41 y.o. skin is in decent condition already (I stay out of the sun.)  I have never needed botox.  I was just hoping for a reduction in fine lines and some pregnancy discoloration.  Didn&#x27;t happen.  Luckily, I didn&#x27;t pay much for the product so I am not angry about money lost.  I do think that the packaging is wasteful - little tubes everywhere and a big plastic holder that is good for nothing after two weeks.</li>
    <li> This product is great ,  olay  replaced  with new packaging same product, but this cheaper. Thank you for provding this product still</li>
    <li> At first I thought the packaging was a little excessive. Did every days treatment have to come in it&#x27;s own dispenser? Obviously the developers at Olay Definity know more than I do, because the tubes contained 2-3 times as much moisturizer as I would normally use. Both types of tubes were pleasant enough. The mask, however, could use improvement. I felt like I could have soaked a paper towel in moisturizer, cut a few holes in it, and slapped it onto my face. The product was pretty decent. I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for 14 days, but I would say there was some improvement in the condition of my skin, not vast, but some.</li>
    <li> This product was ok. I think that the first 7 days of the treatment was where I saw the most improvement, but it only seemed to be right after I put the cream on. My face was instantly brighter and very soft. It didn&#x27;t seem to last, it was gone when I woke up. The second half the last 7 days really didn&#x27;t seem to do anything at all. The mask is um, strange, but it did feel good once it was on, and my skin did feel very soft after the mask. I still have the discoloration that I had when starting this product, and haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement there, or with wrinkles, I&#x27;m 35 and my wrinkles are minimal but I do have discoloration from two masks of pregnancies. I am sure that depending on your skin type and tone products have different results for different people, but in a nut shell I most likely wouldn&#x27;t do this treatment again.</li>
    <li> At 64, I realize, that without a face lift or a derma peel, there is no miracle cream out there. I just have to moisturize and try to tend to and protect whatever precious vitality is left in my estrogen starved thinning skin. I followed the 14 day prescribed regimen and was not hopeful. Then, after I lifted the mask on the 14th day, I was delighted to see a real difference, that so far has lasted over 2 months. MY skin was refreshed and plumped up and more youthful. Not 21, but nice for a woman of my age. I have purchased another 14 day rehab to apply after 3 months as recommended by Olay. Perhaps you have to be older to enjoy the difference this product produces. I notice a lot of younger women are disappointed, perhaps this treatment shows up better on an older face, because a young face doesn&#x27;t need its benefits?</li>
    <li> First, I have to say I&#x27;ve been blessed with good skin.  So when this came up as an offering in the Vine Program I thought, \\&quot;Why not?\\&quot;  Here are my conclusions:  pluses:  it did not break my skin out; it had an okay scent; the packaging was clever  minuses:  each tube contained more than I could easily spread on my face and neck, so it felt a bit wasteful; it took a while for the contents to be totally absorbed into my skin, so I needed to make sure I allowed enough time before going to bed to apply it; I really didn&#x27;t see any great improvement; since I have never used this type of product before, it seemed pretty pricey to me for 2 weeks worth of treatment.    I&#x27;ll stick with my tried and true moisturizers.</li>
    <li> So I got this and it&#x27;s a very hardcore system. I mean it&#x27;s serious about reducing wrinkles with a lot of instructions day-by-day.     The problem is it doesn&#x27;t work. At least for me- I saw absolutely no difference.    ...and the last day is an actual facial mask that was just smelly and uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> The product is just great. It works. I have very sensitive skin and this does the trick. Love the product the price&lt;br /&gt;Was great. The package came completely closed. I damaged and in a good package. Thank you . Will be ordering&lt;br /&gt;From you again.</li>
    <li> This was the first time I used this specific product.  I didn&#x27;t notice any significant change in my skin after using the Olay Definity 14-day Skin Rehabilitation product.</li>
    <li> I loved this product.  My skin looked and felt wonderful after 2 weeks of using this...and only has to be used every 3 months.  Worth the money...and this was the best price I could find for the kit ($21.87).</li>
    <li> Good product, fast delivery, great price!</li>
    <li> \\&quot;OK, but nothing special\\&quot; was the verdict of my lady product-tester for this Olay Skin Rehab kit. Perhaps she&#x27;s fussy, but her main complaint was that the moisturiser element took forever to soak in, and was wasteful in the quantity provided in each daily tube. She also felt little benefit from the kit by the end of the treatment and didn&#x27;t feel that she&#x27;d want to spend the asking price on this product for herself.  Maybe you need to be beyond your late thirties to benefit?</li>
    <li> I used it before and it was more effective.  Not sure why I didn&#x27;t see much difference this time but I like it.&lt;br /&gt;The second phase lotion is somewhat dry and I didn&#x27;t like it as much.  The mask is good.</li>
    <li> This kit did not work for me. I prefer the Olay Daily Regenerating Serum over this product. The little tubes cause too much waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, Amazon was to send me this product through Vine and I have still not received it.</li>
    <li> I tried this Olay program during the winter and my skin became irritated, so I thought I&#x27;d wait until some time had passed and my the cold winter winds and icy temps were making my skin more sensitive than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No go.  I tried it again and my skin felt itchy and uncomfortable.  But to be entirely fair, I have quite a few allergies and have very sensitive skin.  I can&#x27;t even use baby oil on my face.</li>
    <li> I think this is an old product and it&#x27;s hard to get now, but it&#x27;s wonderful on my skin. Not harsh or irritating. Just a nice, easy-to-use, two week renewal regimen.</li>
    <li> I need to say I am skeptical before I even tried the kit. That being said, after 14 days, my skin is softer but there was no noticable decrease in wrinkles or discoloration in my skin. But I would imagine using any good skin product for 14 days would result in softer skin. Not blown away. Sorry.</li>
    <li> Wonderful. Works exactly what was said it does.&lt;br /&gt;I have decided to use it all year round.&lt;br /&gt;Have recommended it to a friend</li>
