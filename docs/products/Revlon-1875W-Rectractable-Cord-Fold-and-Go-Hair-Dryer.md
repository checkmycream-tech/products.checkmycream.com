      <li>I love the way it dries by hair.  </li>
      <li>bought this hair dryer because I love having a retractable cord.</li>
      <li>I purchased this hair dryer at Target, thinking it was the best one for a low price.    </li>
      <li>I bought the 18575W at Goodwill for&lt;br /&gt;.99 &amp; Love it, better than the Andis.</li>
      <li>I have had this dryer for about 3 years and it is my favorite.</li>
      <li>I paid under $20 at Walmart, so I sure got my moneys worth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have used it for a year with no problems and I still love the dryer.</li>
      <li>I still love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the power of this.</li>
      <li>I purchased this dryer because of the features that it offered (retractable cord, folds for storage, multiple heat and power options) which would be great - if I could turn it on and off!</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t love it, but thought it was pretty good.</li>
      <li>Seemed like a great price for a decent hair dryer.</li>
      <li>First of all, you have to retract the cord out all the way and give it a good yank for it to stay out; otherwise it will start retracting on you.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this hair dryer for years now every single day and it always makes my curly hair look flawless!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is VERY powerful, I love the retracting cord and fold up handle.</li>
      <li>The cord does not roll up easily.</li>
      <li>Buttons do not change positon easily.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also foldable for easy storage in a suitcase.</li>
      <li>the dryer stopped blowing hot or warm air.  </li>
      <li>Chord works fine, switches loosen up.</li>
      <li>The seller is pretty awesome though and got me a replacement within the next 3 days after..</li>
      <li>The dryer part of both work fine.  </li>
      <li>Works just fine.</li>
      <li>It dries my hair fine</li>
      <li>Like I said, it works fine,</li>
      <li>The folding handle and retractable cord work just fine, very nice for storage, and yes the cord doesn&#x27;t really fully retract after the first time you use it</li>
      <li>It works perfectly and I can take it everywhere in little space.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t even give it away for free.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten out of the habit of electric drying both for ecological reasons and for noise/hearing damage.  </li>
      <li>I figured I should buy a cheap hair dryer to use in the meantime.      </li>
      <li>I just ordered another one because it looks great and the fact that it folds and has a retractable cord are a big plus for storage.  </li>
      <li>The controls feel cheap and stick when moving</li>
      <li>Amazon arranged for the free return and pickup of both hair dryers.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s how hair dryers sound.  </li>
      <li>Started to get a rattling sound inside of it with a burnt smell.</li>
      <li>No visible sparks, just the sound...</li>
      <li>Works great, fast shipping, thanks</li>
      <li>Quick and easy.</li>
      <li>easy to store and does a good job with it&#x27;s multiple heat settings.</li>
      <li>, I wasn&#x27;t too pleased with the first one the cord wasn&#x27;t retracting and was part of the reason I went with this one again.</li>
      <li>This created a significant pinching hazard.  </li>
      <li>and I supposed it&#x27;s nice having the kind of \\&quot;fabric\\&quot; (not really</li>
      <li>I had a nice, semi-expensive dryer prior to this, but because of my very fine hair, it was way too powerful, even on the lowest setting.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s nothing really special about it...</li>
      <li>I bought this dryer after I used a similar dryer in a Hampton Inn Hotel and loved it.</li>
      <li>This hair dryer dries my hair pretty fast, great, but IT IS LOUD.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> One of the greatest features is the retractable cord.  No more having to try to wrap cord for travel. Dryer is better than most hotel dryers.  It is a little heavy for a travel dryer.  However, I feel that the trade off for speed of drying is well worth it.</li>
    <li> This i gave as gift &amp; it blew up within one month!!!!</li>
    <li> Trust everyone that says the switch is impossible...it is!!!! i actually have a small tool in my bathroom that I have to use to turn it on!!! It is loud but, honestly, I could deal with that if the switch wasn&#x27;t the most ridiculous design EVER!</li>
    <li> Yes, it does dry hair. There&#x27;s nothing really special about it...it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair any faster than any other dryer I&#x27;ve tried. It has your basic high/low/cool settings and...that&#x27;s about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this hair dryer because I love having a retractable cord. And..it also folds which I figured would be a bonus when I travel. But after about 2 months of use, the cord only retracts about half way (and it doesn&#x27;t really have a powerful retract...you kind of have to push the cord in to get it to go at all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing I really hate about this dryer (other reviews said this too) it the on/off switch. It&#x27;s flat and there&#x27;s nothing to grasp with it, so you have to dig your thumbnail in between the switch and plastic siding and pull up (and it&#x27;s broken my nail once or twice in the process...ouch!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the packaging advertises that it&#x27;s \\&quot;super quiet\\&quot;, but I would say it&#x27;s the same as other dryers I&#x27;ve owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, don&#x27;t buy this one. There&#x27;s nothing remarkable about it, and the basic features are difficult to use.</li>
    <li> I got this dryer about 8 months ago, and it is does not turn on anymore. The buttons were very difficult to work, but the longer I had it, the easier it became to slide them. It does have heat settings which I like, but the retractable cord is not very dependable. After trying out different hairdryers, I realize how much I liked this one despite its fallbacks. I guess I just got really attached to it.</li>
    <li> ...but that is all the positive I can say about this. I bought one of these tonight at a local store to replace my dead Conair - folding handle, retractable cord were what sold me originally. However the cord is not long enough to get to the top of your head (it is half the length of my previous dryer). I couldn&#x27;t find any info on how long it was supposed to be but I couldn&#x27;t seem to get it out any further.     The switch is impossible to work with an arthritic thumb. You shouldn&#x27;t have to use two hands to turn the thing on or off!    NOISE! WOW! Loud and irritating! This thing is going back tomorrow. Obviously not a Happy Camper with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I had a Conair hair dryer for about 10 years before it died on me a few weeks ago. I decided on this Revlon hair dryer for features including the retractable cord and folding handle among others. Seemed like a great price for a decent hair dryer. It dries my hair fine but I cannot stand the on/off switches. They don&#x27;t slide up and down easily and I often have to wedge something underneath the slide to get it to turn on. Drives me nuts. I don&#x27;t recommend this dryer for that reason.</li>
    <li> Im amazed at the negative reviews. I have had this dryer for about 3 years and it is my favorite. Recently, the retracable cord hasnt worked well, I tried to open it to fix it, then I broke off another part. Now, I use this dryer 1-2x/day. I paid under $20 at Walmart, so I sure got my moneys worth.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a conair here on Amazon that I will be returning and purchasing this one AGAIN.&lt;br /&gt;It is VERY powerful, I love the retracting cord and fold up handle.</li>
    <li> I had a nice, semi-expensive dryer prior to this, but because of my very fine hair, it was way too powerful, even on the lowest setting.  So I intentionally went looking for a cheap dryer and selected this one mainly for the retractable cord and diffuser.    The retractable cord is pointless.  First of all, you have to retract the cord out all the way and give it a good yank for it to stay out; otherwise it will start retracting on you.  Then when you do try to retract it, it doesn&#x27;t go all the way, no matter how much I try to untwist and encourage it!  The other appliances I have with retractable cords give you the option to only pull the cord out part-way, this really threw me for a loop.    The folding handle is nice; it will come in handy for travel.  The cool-shot is not as cold as my previous dryer, but satisfactory.    The diffuser falls off alot during use, which I am not used to - the one on my last dryer was very secure and took effort to remove; this one falls off with a slight nudge.  Its annoying.      The dryer functions ok if you just want a basic cheap dryer, but the features I bought it for are not at all worth the hassle!  I would recommend looking at other models.</li>
    <li> I once had an amazing hair dryer.  I accidentally left it behind while traveling, forcing me to search for a new hair dryer.  I am moving to Europe soon, which means I will have to buy ANOTHER hair dryer when I arrive over there, and I&#x27;d like to purchase a high-end European-outlet-friendly hair dryer in the future, so I figured I should buy a cheap hair dryer to use in the meantime.      I purchased this hair dryer at Target, thinking it was the best one for a low price.    I was wrong.  This hair dryer is a monster.  I can&#x27;t tell you how much I hate it, and how much I hate having to use it every. single. day.  When I walk into a store that carries hair dryers, I want to rush to the hair dryer aisle and find a better one, but I know I should save my money.     First of all, the sound that comes out of this hair dryer is... it&#x27;s like... it&#x27;s like no hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever experienced.  It sounds like a robot is screaming in your ear.  Yes, this is exactly what it would sound like if a baby robot was wailing into your eardrum.  In fact, the first time that I used this hair dryer, I walked around for the rest of the day saying, \\&quot;WHAT? WHAT DID YOU SAY? STOP MUMBLING! I&#x27;M NOT SHOUTING, YOU&#x27;RE MUMBLING!\\&quot;     The second time I used this hair dryer, I decided to use ear plugs.  This seemed to solve my problem, although it seemed ridiculous that I had to use ear plugs just to dry my hair.  I figured, \\&quot;Hey, I can live with that.  This is just temporary.  I&#x27;ll find another hair dryer in Europe.  Then, I&#x27;ll be in Europe, which will be awesome, and I&#x27;ll be using a better hair dryer, which will be even more awesome.  It will be like the little pot of gold on the other side of the ocean rainbow.\\&quot;    The third time I used this hair dryer, I couldn&#x27;t find one of my earplugs because my cat apparently ate it (if I could rate this cat, probably I would give it one star for being an idiot).  I decided to just use one earplug, that way only one of my eardrums was being damaged?  I&#x27;m not sure what kind of logic I was using, but I probably hadn&#x27;t had a cup of coffee yet.  This was a really bad idea, actually.  Due to suffering damage in only ONE ear, I suffered from spells of vertigo periodically for the rest of the day.  I&#x27;m not kidding you--one minute I was walking, and the next minute I was walking sideways, and the next minute I was on the floor.  For the record, I had not been drinking.  This hair dryer will damage your ear drums and throw your equilibrium into a frenzy.      So basically, do not buy this terrible machine unless you are deaf or you are wearing some form of ear protection.        P.S. Since I am moving, I have decided to have a big garage sale/give-away for all of my friends and family.  Out of the goodness of my heart, I absolutely REFUSE to sell this hair dryer.  I won&#x27;t even give it away for free.  I wouldn&#x27;t wish this kind of hair drying experience upon my worst enemy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too heavy, it wiggles when you dry because of the folding handle, the retractable cord is too short, it&#x27;s noisy, the buttons are insanely hard to turn on, the cool shot button is too easily pushed by mistake and it&#x27;s toooooooo heavy!  When you have long hair you feel like you have been lifting weights with one arm for 20 minutes. Ouchie...... DO NOT BUY IT!  The people are Revlon need to go back to the drawing board with this one.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer about a year ago at Target becuase I was looking for a dryer with a diffuser.  The first time I tried it, it was very difficult to turn on becuase of the flat switches, which are pretty stiff, and the texture they have on them doesn&#x27;t help you grip them at all.  And it takes forever to dry your hair with it becuase it doesn&#x27;t seem to get all that hot.  The folding handle and retractable cord work just fine, very nice for storage, and yes the cord doesn&#x27;t really fully retract after the first time you use it, you&#x27;re left with about 2 inches of cord sticking out.  I definitely would not recommend this hair dryer. The only reason I can&#x27;t bring myself to throw it out is because it technically still works and I&#x27;ll at least have some hair dryer in case my good one breaks.</li>
    <li> Used item , hair in back of blower , I paid for new item , very disappointed</li>
    <li> I thought I had researched this model, but apparently I didn&#x27;t.  Now that I read the poor reviews, I can only nod in agreement.  It is loud.  It is heavy.  The buttons are very difficult to use.  And, to add insult to injury, mine stopped working within the first week of my owning it.  I&#x27;ll be returning it immediately.</li>
    <li> I like this hair dryer a lot. I would&#x27;ve given it five stars, but the retract button didn&#x27;t work right out of the box.</li>
    <li> I purchased this from Target a little over three months ago (so, sadly I can&#x27;t return it) and the heating element has already died. I like the folding and retractable cord features as well as the reasonable price, but it isn&#x27;t a deal if you have to replace it every three months! I&#x27;ll spend a little more next time and get a higher quality product.</li>
    <li> This dryer is awful, the attachments dont seem to fit, the button on the dryer its almost IMPOSSIBLE to turn on and off and no other universal attachments seem to fit this dryer. Retractable chord no longer retracts and the folding mechanism snapped inside so that is now broken as well.  I had no idea it was even possible to make a hair dryer this awful.TOTAL waste of money! :(</li>
    <li> I purchased this dryer because of the features that it offered (retractable cord, folds for storage, multiple heat and power options) which would be great - if I could turn it on and off! As it is, I fight the controls which makes it impossible to use. And quiet? Not in my world! This thing is loud with a very high-pitched, screeching tone much like fingernails on a chalk board.    I&#x27;m returning this one. It&#x27;s not worth the effort.</li>
    <li> Do NOT buy this hair dryer!  I purchased one just over a year ago, and the heating element died after 6 months (and I don&#x27;t even use it daily).  Not being a fast learner, I bough the same dryer, and guess what?  6 months later, the heating element died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.  I will not be purchasing another Revlon dyer again.</li>
    <li> I rate this negative stars, but forced to provide at least one for review.  I purchased this hair dryer less than 10 months ago from Target.  The selling points for me where the retractable cord, and quiet description.  Retractable cord worked ok, at times got stuck.  It was not quiet.    Lately I&#x27;ve noticed it made a funny sound once in a while.  As if something were grinding in it.  Today I turned it on, and it started to shoot sparks!!!  Luckily my hair was no where near the line of fire (literally)!  Sadly, I no longer have the receipt and doubt I can return it at Target.  I will try to write Revlon but unsure if it will do any good.  This is just a lesson learned to never buy Revlon hair dryer.  I&#x27;ve had Conair in the past and never any issues.  Heck they lasted about 10 years...  I would recommend anyone looking to purchase a hair dryer not to buy this one...unless you want your hair up in flames.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer in a rush at Target and have regretted it ever since. My main issue with the design are the buttons. They are meant to be slid into position but I usually cannot get it to budge and have to try to force it my thumb nail, which isn&#x27;t very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also very loud and it constantly makes a popping crackling what-have-you noise like it may explode any moment.</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer I have ever had!</li>
    <li> I owned this dryer for a few years when it recently started smoking and sparking, as I was using it.  I just ordered another one because it looks great and the fact that it folds and has a retractable cord are a big plus for storage.  Hopefully my new one will last a few years as well.</li>
    <li> Pros: Dries hair. Folds in half.     Cons: Awkward buttons that won&#x27;t budge at first, then leap past the desired setting. Retractable cord should be called \\&quot;stuffable cord.\\&quot; Stopped working after 6 months.</li>
    <li> weak power, weak heat, difficult switches, and loud (high whine, feel like it is deafening me as I use.)&lt;br /&gt;Awful.</li>
    <li> I bought this hairdryer ...twice ...for the retractable cord.  On the  first one I received the cord didn&#x27;tretract at all so I returned it and asked for a replacement. I  figured it was a fluke. Replacement was only slightly better. Cord retraction was rough and sporactic. So I returned for a refund. Amazon arranged for the free return and pickup of both hair dryers. So I may have unhappy with the purchases but the return process was a very good experience! It is just a defective design...My husband picked up one at Target and the retractable cord didn&#x27;t work on it either!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer for a couple of years. It&#x27;s never been great. The cord has never retracted correctly. The on/off button is hard to use. Well today I dried my bangs which took all of 2 minutes. A few minutes later I was in another room, I heard the hair dryer make some noise &amp; briefly turn on. I went into the bathroom to find it smoking &amp; shooting sparks. If you have this hair dryer, throw it out!! I am so lucky I was home &amp; nobody got hurt.</li>
    <li> I hate this hair dryer. Sure, it dries efficiently, and I like the retractable cord feature (which you sometimes have to coax along, and the cord is too short), but I bought this hair dryer for the concentrator-the attachment that allows you to dry a very small and specific are (like at the salon). It just snaps on, instead of having a twist lock or something-which means if you so much as tap it (say, with the brush you&#x27;re using to style), the attachment flies off. EVERY SINGLE MORNING. The switch is also a pain in the butt-hard to manipulate.  Like I said, it works fine, but I&#x27;m going to buy a different model so that I don&#x27;t drive myself crazy every day.</li>
    <li> The high-pitched whine of this hair dryer on the high speed setting is unbelievably loud.  It&#x27;s better on the low and medium speeds but then the drying  time is REALLY long. Overall, just not a great dryer.</li>
    <li> great, love the retractable cord, also accessories are great!</li>
    <li> Bought this almost exactly 2 1/2 months ago. MONTHS. Bought it to leave at a friend&#x27;s house for primarily weekend use so the folding handle and retractable cord were the main selling features for me. Yes, the buttons were hard and it was a bit heavy, but it also cut drying time. Didn&#x27;t love it, but thought it was pretty good. Today, after using just a handful of times, it stopped heating. The bf is currently trying to fix it but I see Conair back in my future.</li>
    <li> Expected it to last longer than it did. Worked good for about a year, then while using it, I heard snapping noises and several small plastic pieces came out of the nozzle. Based on the pieces that came out, I believe what happened is part of the handle detente mechanism (that snaps the handle into the open position) broke off internally and then got caught in the fan blades, causing small pieces of the fan blades to break off.  I used this about 4 days a week. If you only use it occasionally might meet your expectations.</li>
    <li> Bought this to be my little travel hair dryer and wish I hadn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s huge and the diffuser is comically large. I also broke the retractable cord within five minutes of having it. Would have returned it, but after reading the ridiculous directions I discovered it was my fault. Bought a different one and I&#x27;m way happier with it.</li>
    <li> great dryer! easy to store and does a good job with it&#x27;s multiple heat settings.</li>
    <li> This dryer dries hair fast with various heat options and speed.  The retractable cord is very convenient.  I bought this dryer after I used a similar dryer in a Hampton Inn Hotel and loved it. I am surprised at the complaints about this dryer.  I have used it for a year with no problems and I still love the dryer.</li>
    <li> My old blow dryer was this exact model and I absolutely loved it. However, the one that came in from Amazon for this purchase disappointed me as the retractable cord doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Works great, fast shipping, thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had 3 of these hair druers and was happy with them because of the folding feature. The last one I purchased through Amazon stopped heating correctly within 2 weeks of use. Thats just poor....</li>
    <li> I recently had to replace a very quiet hair dryer. The model I had previously was not in stock, so I purchased this Revlon 1875w Tourmaline dryer because of the \\&quot;super quiet\\&quot; labeling. The retractable cord and folding handle were features that helped me decide which model to choose.      The folding handle is great for storing the dryer away more compactly.    The retractable cord is a very nice feature, though not perfect as it doesn&#x27;t always fully retract if there&#x27;s a slight bend in the cord.     The dryer may be \\&quot;super quiet\\&quot; compared to much older models, but the high pitched whine of the motor is unpleasant and not that quiet.  Dh complains about it regularly.    The real deal breaker for me, however, is the power switch. It is a flat slide switch which is difficult to move to desired speed setting. Dh suggested I get some rubber finger tips from Staples so I&#x27;d have some traction.  I&#x27;d rather get a quieter dryer with a switch I can operate.    I have ordered my previous brand online and will be returning the Revlon dryer as soon as the replacement arrives.</li>
    <li> The cord does not retract. I&#x27;ve bought this blue dryer for years in the store and the first one I buy online doesn&#x27;t work the same. Pretty disappointing since the retractable cord is the reason I buy it in the first place.</li>
    <li> I researched dryers extensively, bought the Andis (retractable, etc), liked it&lt;br /&gt;for size, worked well. The switches weren&#x27;t ideal, but... Then after a year it stopped clicking&lt;br /&gt;into full position (&amp; I didn&#x27;t fold &amp; retract regularly), then a piece that fell out of&lt;br /&gt;the mechanism got into the motor&#x3D; into the trash, not even worth salvaging. I bought the 18575W at Goodwill for&lt;br /&gt;.99 &amp; Love it, better than the Andis. Unlike many other reviewers, I find the switch&lt;br /&gt;to be zero problem, actually prefer it, plus nothing is in the way of ones hand while drying.&lt;br /&gt;There you go; there&#x27;s no telling &amp; opinions are anecdotal!</li>
    <li> I have been using this hair dryer for years now every single day and it always makes my curly hair look flawless! When I&#x27;m done I just zip up the cord and put it back in the drawer, easy peasy! I did have some issues with the cord retraction before but I find if it stops then pull it out slightly until it clicks once or twice and then push the retraction button again and guide the cord as it&#x27;s pulling it in. Works just fine. Most people cause the problem by pulling out the cord way too far and messing up the mechanism. There are markings on the cord itself when it gets to the end to warn you and prevent this. The attachments fit perfectly and I can either diffuse/go natural curly with the bowl diffuser or I can straighten/blowout with the concentrator. I&#x27;ve spend hundreds on dryers and straighteners before and this is the only thing I use ever. Give it a try. Amazon has a great return policy if you decide it isn&#x27;t your favorite. Oh also, my long curly hair dries in about 10 minutes on the HOT AIR/LOW SPEED setting and the cool shot to seal in and set the curls. Additional unrelated tip: if you have curly hair and use &amp;#34;Curl Keeper&amp;#34; and this dryer with diffuser attachment you will achieve the curliest possible style your hair will allow.</li>
    <li> Great dryer.  Love the retractable cord and the way the unit folds in half.  Great for travelling.  I really like the soft grip coating; it makes it easy to hold the dryer in weird positions when trying to get at the hair from all angles.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but we&#x27;ll worth it.</li>
    <li> Love this blow dryer!</li>
    <li> Item stopped working - beyoned 30 day policy guess I&#x27;m out of luck.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer stopped heating up after 2 months.  It only blows cool air now.</li>
    <li> It’s good but do you really need the extra pieces? And the retract cord sticks sometimes.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer about 2-3 years ago. I never had any problem with it. I used it about a few times a week for about 10-15 min. The retractable cord didn&#x27;t always work too well (would kind of get stuck and I had to play with it a bit to get it to retract the entire cord) but I never had a dryer with a retractable cord before, so I was still tickled pink it could even do that the majority of the time when it was working! The buttons can be a little annoying at times, but I&#x27;ve managed.  Only recently I am having to replace it because it accidently fell into a toilet.</li>
    <li> the retractible cord and the ionic technology were the selling points for me.  the box reads \\&quot;provides maximum hair-conditioning ions for smooth, frizz-free hair.\\&quot;  not true.  my hair is curly and the ionic technology usually does the trick on managing dryer frizz.  however, this is not the case with this hair dryer.  i have come to the conclusion that the concentrator attachment is the problem.  it has holes on both sides that allow escape of air, and i can&#x27;t think of any other reason than this to explain the frizz.  i bought a conair ionic as well, with the same type of concentrator, causing the same issue with my hair.  my previous dryer gave me the results that i like, and there were no holes in the concentrator.  the hunt continues...</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I replaced this dryer within 2 weeks of use because I could see the damage to my hair.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because it does dry fairly quickly.  It is much louder that my last dryer.  The power switch is difficult to move.  Some mornings it wouldn&#x27;t turn on until I put the retractable cord in and out a few times.  The worst downfall is the damage to my hair though.  After 2 weeks of use, I started to notice split ends and dry fly-aways.  Not good at all....do not buy.</li>
    <li> I have purchased 3 of this hair dryer and each one has not lasted more than 6 months. 2 just stopped working and the other, the handle broke and you can no longer use it.</li>
    <li> Would not recommend this product. It is heavy, loud, and difficult to use buttons. Buttons do not change positon easily. Also it seems to short out my electrical circuit. I have already replaced it. Does not dry hair faster or smoother than cheaper, lighter versions. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this. I bought this dryer in a local store less than a year ago and just a few days ago, it stopped heating. It just blows cold air. I thought mine was defective so I was actually perusing Amazon looking for a replacement for this dryer when I saw it on here and all the bad reviews. I decided to stop and put in my 2 cents worth.  The switches are terribly difficult to operate. I have to use my fingernails not my fingers alone. The retractable cord doesn&#x27;t operate very well. But as another reviewer said, the folding handle is great. It&#x27;s the only part that works the way it should. Also the attachments are impossible to stay on. You just tap them (as you normally do while drying your hair) and they come off and go bouncing all over the floor.  Hey Revlon! I think this model needs more work!</li>
    <li> great for traveling. have a little trouble getting cord to retract but I haven&#x27;t used it much, so should loosen up as I use it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a bad product and it certainly dries my hair just fine, but as far as quiet or powerful, i would say it sounds like the motor is straining to push air out. It is no where near as powerful as the blow dryers at my gym. But i really like the retractable cord (even though it needs help sometimes) and the fact that the handle folds in making it more compact to store in my tiny apartment bathroom.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great works good and was just what I needed for traveling</li>
    <li> Best that i have ever owned.</li>
    <li> great product, great price!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is undoubtedly a great price and it does get the job done.  I haven&#x27;t had any fuss with the fuse or anything and I supposed it&#x27;s nice having the kind of \\&quot;fabric\\&quot; (not really...suede like?) feel of the hair dryer (Vs. plastic) for wet hands.  That said, the buttons used to operate this thing are impossible.  If you&#x27;ve recently put lotion on your hands then you can just forget it.  Seriously....more than once have had to use a butter knife to operate it, my friends and my mom have had the same troubles.  I would definitely pay $5 for one with better buttons.</li>
    <li> Not going to go get a new one bcz this is my new one and I threw out the box before I realized how irritating it is! So i&#x27;ll keep using it, but i don&#x27;t like that the switch is really hard to turn off/on sometimes whether my hands are completely dry or with lotions, the gripping bumps are small with the slide idea, just aren&#x27;t a good combo. And then theres the \\&quot;retractable\\&quot; cord....ha. not always and then you have to feed it into the dryer--better than the entire cord but irritating nonetheless when it&#x27;s purchased bcz of that feature.</li>
    <li> This one replaced one exactly like it which the handle would no longer lock in place.  The new one has an issue that you have to fight the cord to get it to retract.  The dryer part of both work fine.  The bells and whistles neither chime or whistle.</li>
    <li> This product works as it says it does.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought 3 of these in the past 3 years.  I love the way it dries by hair.  Quick &amp; doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s burning the hair. - the negative - They don&#x27;t last more than a year.  -</li>
    <li> I purchased this hairdryer four months ago, and the heating element has already broken. I generally fold it up when I store it, and one day while I was opening it to use it I heard a strange metallic pop. Apparently, that was the heating element breaking. It&#x27;s now pretty useless; it will only blow cold air (just in time for winter, I might add).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an aside, this is the second Revlon hairdryer I&#x27;ve bought this year after having a hairdryer of another brand for a few years. I&#x27;m beginning to think that the brand itself is not reliable--or at least the lower end ones aren&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I was given this for Christmas and i&#x27;m baffled by the reviews. Yes, it&#x27;s a little hard to turn on and it&#x27;s a little loud. But I don&#x27;t think that warrants 1-2 star ratings. For me, this dryer is fantastic, it seems to dry 3x faster than my old, old dryer, and I haven&#x27;t had either of the attachments pop off. I really like the attachments, I can get nice volume in my hair. My hair is naturally very thick and frizzy. My hair is still frizzy after use ( I always straighten after with any dryer ), however, it is less frizzy then with my old con-air ion dryer. And then, the whole dryer folds up and the cord retracts - awesome ! So I give it 4 stars. The stiff buttons and loudness are my only dislikes, but they don&#x27;t bother me that much.</li>
    <li> I love the power of this. However, after about a year, the folding  handle breaks and causes it to swing making it really hard to use. Ive purchased two of these and both have had the same problem. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Chord works fine, switches loosen up. Good price.</li>
    <li> It works as expected, the button to retract the cord is little stiff otherwise it is prefect.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a lot of low reviews for this hair dryer and most are because it&#x27;s loud. Yes, it is loud. I don&#x27;t use a hair dryer to style my hair I just want it to dry it as quickly as possible. I have long hair to my lower back, its (mostly) straight and very fine hair. I part my hair in the middle. Then turn it on to the highest speend and hot. I dry my left side in 5 mins then my right side- another 5 mins. This is the 3rd time I&#x27;ve bought this hair drier. The 1st one died when I dropped it. R.I.P. The second one just died after 5 years... It wouldn&#x27;t heat up. 5 years for $20.. That&#x27;s a good deal to me. If you&#x27;re looking for a fancy hair dryer to carfeully and (apparently) silently... continue looking. If you&#x27;re looking for a hair dryer that will dry your hear in 10-15 mins (if you have thick hair) then this one could be it.</li>
    <li> This is the worst P.O.S. hair dryer I ever bought. The strength of the air is weak and the buttons are so flimsy. Not only are they flimsy and you can tell it&#x27;s poorly made, but they are hard to turn on.  Waste of money. Doesn&#x27;t even get that hot. Don&#x27;t buy this one.  I felt so strongly about how bad this hair dryer is that I made a point to retreive it from the trash to get the exact model so I can rate it on amazon. I&#x27;m not at all surprised to see others rating it low as well. I should have checked here first.</li>
    <li> broke the first time I used it</li>
    <li> Great dryer, but the cord never did retract....</li>
    <li> Do not purchase this!  Save your money and buy a different brand.  I bought this hair dryer about a month ago bc my previous Revlon that I had for all of 6 months started shorting out (should have been a red flag after only 6 months). But..i bought this one bc of the retractable cord - thought that would solve my shorting out issues.  Well...I almost returned this dryer immediately after taking it out of the box...I could BAREL&lt;br /&gt;Y get the controls to slide on and off.  They work SOOO hard you really can&#x27;t operate them with one hand.  But I kept, thinking they would &amp;#34;loosen up&amp;#34; after using a few times (they didn&#x27;t).  But...I got used to that issue.  The cord doesn&#x27;t always fully retract - not a show stopper.  The deal breaker was after only 1 MONTH...the dryer stopped blowing hot or warm air.  All I get is cool/cold air blowing out.  Ever try drying your hair with only cool air...impossible.  I give it a few trys thinking it was a fluke, but nope.  Only cool air.  So into the trash it went and I will never buy another Revlon hair dryer ever again.</li>
    <li> The speed and heat settings are wonderful. I don&#x27;t get that gross feeling like it is burning my hair, or blowing it insanely, like with other blow driers. It is very convenient for storage.</li>
    <li> Cord stopped retracting after about a month. The cold shot button is located where it can be pressed by accident. That&#x27;s not a big deal though. Glad I kept the box and receipt so I can return it. The controls feel cheap and stick when moving so I had a feeling this dryer wouldn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair dryer and it&#x27;s the third I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> Actually, it is not the thing that I imagined because it is bigger than my imagination and too heavy.</li>
    <li> Switches are hard, difficult to switch from one setting to another. After a year (I&#x27;m in Florida), the rubber handle gets sticky!</li>
    <li> I bought this at Target without looking up reviews... mistakes were made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By far, this has been the most annoying hair dryer I&#x27;ve owned.  And trust me, when it comes to a product you&#x27;re going to be using almost everyday, you do not want it to be annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) STIFF BUTTONS -- The buttons are flush with the surface of the handle, and they&#x27;re intended to be slid up and down.  Unfortunately, they&#x27;re incredibly stiff and difficult to move.  I have to use my fingernail every time (which is irritating and uncomfortable), and even then I often have to fidget/wiggle it around.  Sometimes it takes a couple of tries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) ATTACHMENT FALLS OFF -- Oh man.  Ugh.  I use the concentrator attachment, and seriously, the touch of a feather is enough to knock that thing off the dryer.  Literally every time it falls off in the middle of use.  If not once, then twice, sometimes even three times.  The worst part is that, once it falls off, it then bounces around the bathroom, making a HUGE clattering ruckus, before finally landing somewhere.  This seems to happen most often when other people are still asleep and I&#x27;m trying to be quiet.  My boyfriend is always highly amused at the #*$&amp; that comes out of my mouth when this happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now, after about a year of frequent use, the dryer has begun to make loud sparking noises.  No visible sparks, just the sound... but I&#x27;m not about to wait for actual fire before I toss this.  I&#x27;d like to keep my hair, thanks.  I&#x27;m already shopping for another one.  Honestly, I&#x27;m not even that put out.  It&#x27;s a relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONE thing I liked about the dryer was its compactness -- because of the retracting cord and folding handle, it took up little space in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> Infrequent user.  Second purchase of this model.  First one lasted a few years until the cord didn&#x27;t retract, and then something came loose and smelled chemically acrid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It moves air and dries fairly well.  No particular change in frizz-level compared to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Temps are spot on with me; it&#x27;s nice to know I won&#x27;t get burned nor be frustrated by a too-cool warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten out of the habit of electric drying both for ecological reasons and for noise/hearing damage.  The only person really bothered by my wet hair or the results if nature-dried is me.  I don&#x27;t find it any louder than any of my previous dryers, but my DD hates it with a passion. I&#x27;m thinking about using it as punishment (not really, but I probably could).  I don&#x27;t get it, though. That&#x27;s how hair dryers sound.  She winced at a 1200W mini, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My cord retracts just fine, not like a shade, but I&#x27;m glad to have the heftier/safer cord without a vicious, finger-eating spring.  it took hundreds of in-and-outs for my old one to give out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The switches could have benefited mightily with even a slightly a concave dragging surface.  This strikes me as an efficiency design that wasn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s not intolerable, though. If it bothered me that much I&#x27;d glop some plastic adhesive on it to give it a thumb-knob or edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  &amp;#60;3  love &amp;#60;3  the surface. It&#x27;s totally Lenovo (not cheap).  It&#x27;s *great* (grippable) if you don&#x27;t always use the handle (like when the handle is folded in).  That said, it&#x27;s not makeup-friendly, or rather, it is.  Oily pigmented stuff shows up on this and can be hard to get really clean. 90% rubbing alcohol does the trick.  I still love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My attachments stay on, tightly. (Save the rubber bands from your broccoli and wrap them around the dryer exhaust to increase its diameter.  Cram-like-heck the attachments onto the dryer.  There are other solutions, too. like flexing the tabs with  a screwdriver.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say skip this, frankly.  Go for one with easier switches and a lower decibel output... at a higher price.</li>
    <li> Junk. Hard to clean and it took a long time to dry. Other retractable hair dryers can be had for about the same price. Started to get a rattling sound inside of it with a burnt smell. lasted under a year.</li>
    <li> Do not like the buttons they are too hard to push because they do not have a grip and are too slick. The cord does not roll up easily. The heating elements work very well and the style and feel of the handle is all very good. It was not so expensive so I guess I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> This is gigantic!  My previous folding travel hair dryer looks like a toy by this one. AND it&#x27;s heavy.&lt;br /&gt;But the very worst feature: the controls are slightly grooved pieces of slippery shiny plastic that you are supposed to slide with your thumbs. I was never able to get enough grip and had to use my nails to get these &amp;#34;sliders&amp;#34; to move.&lt;br /&gt;What a disappointment from a well known company. Didn&#x27;t they test this with real people?</li>
    <li> It just arrived , and is exactly the one I wanted</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t Stop! Just Fold and go, fast easy not complicated gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m at amazon today to purchase a replacement for this product which I&#x27;ve owned for approximately 3 years. Worked great during that time w/ the exception of the on/off switch frequently becoming stuck and difficult to operate. It is now frozen in the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; position. Continuing usage until my new blowdryer arrives by simply unplugging it.</li>
    <li> Retraction doesn&#x27;t last, incredibly heavy product, defuser never stays on, Controll switches are near impossible to use. Terrible product other than it functions with effort</li>
    <li> Before purchasing this product from amazon I had one for a very long time.. up until a year later it began to give me problems, sounding like something was cracking or breaking inside due to the heat.. one day it gave out. So I ordered another one from here, I wasn&#x27;t too pleased with the first one the cord wasn&#x27;t retracting and was part of the reason I went with this one again. The seller is pretty awesome though and got me a replacement within the next 3 days after.. but this one is like my very first one and it is new.. something actually cracked and came off inside. I shook it just a bit because I heard something rattling and out came a piece of plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe the blow dryer itself is just no good unfortunately. Love the retractable cord though! For that and for the sellers awesome service I give this product two stars.</li>
    <li> This had terrible reviews but it was the only one I could find with the 3 things I wanted: diffuser, retractable cord, and folding handle. I figured for the price it was with a try. I&#x27;m so glad I did because I love it! I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews. It dries my hair quickly and my very curly hair looks great!</li>
    <li> DANGEROUS!!!&lt;br /&gt;This hair dryer is SO NOT WORTH YOUR $$$$!!!  As reported by other reviewers the flat sliding on/off switch was difficult to operate, especially if your hands were not totally dry.  The folding handle stopped staying open after 6mo.  This created a significant pinching hazard.  After 9mo the dryer began to over heat each time it was used.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t understand everyone&#x27;s negative reviews about this dryer.  It dries my hair in half the time my old dryer took, it is no louder than any other blow dryer I&#x27;ve ever used, the controls are not difficult to use at all (you just push them upwards, for heavens sake!), and the retractable cord retracts exactly as it should.  The best thing is, even with all the positive things about the dryer, it didn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg like some I looked at.  &amp;#34;Sticker&amp;#34; shock indeed.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I agree with the fact the buttons are hard to use, the retractable chord doesn&#x27;t fully retract - but I&#x27;ve had mine for almost 2 years without any issues and it blows strong and hot.  Maybe try a similar model from Revlon if you are scared of buying this one, but my only issues are costmetic in how they designed it.</li>
    <li> Glad to have found a blow dryer that has the same power as my previous one.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer dries my hair pretty fast, great, but IT IS LOUD. Very very LOUD. My boyfriend even complains about how loud and high pitched it is..&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that, the retractable cord, does not fully retract, you need to push it in. The switch is impossible to use.&lt;br /&gt;Oh and the concentrator attachment, flimsy, very flimsy, I dropped it ONCE on carpet and it broke in half, but that&#x27;s not even the worst part, it kept flying off the dryer itself.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty sure a heating element in mine is busted too because hardly any hot air comes out anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Only good aspect is that it fold up and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space.&lt;br /&gt;This is the second Revlon hair dryer I&#x27;ve had that has broken on me within hardly 2 months of use. No more Revlon hair dryers for me.</li>
    <li> This is a bomb waiting to go off. I bought mine from Target in 2013. I&#x27;ve been too scared to make use of its folding capabilities because the mechanism felt so flimsy. Despite that, today one of the gears just fell out into my lap and another one got sucked inside of the dryer causing sparks and a horrifying noise. I shut it off before anything truly bad happened. Do not buy this hair dryer.</li>
    <li> This product was a terrible disappointment. The retractable cord stopped retracting almost the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> This is my second dryer.  I was lucky to find it again.</li>
    <li> It works perfectly and I can take it everywhere in little space.</li>
    <li> I like this hair dryer. Had another one exactly the same befor and lasted a few years. I never minded that it was a little hard to slide on and off.&lt;br /&gt;The retractable feature broke immediately. What a shame.</li>
    <li> will dry hair very fast</li>
    <li> Good, dependable, dries hair well, no major problems.  We like this a lot...my teenage daughter and I share use.  We both have thick hair and hers is long, too.  The retractable cord is not perfectly smooth -- it does not quickly zap back, for example -- but works pretty well.  The speed and coolness options are good, no problems with those switches as other reviews noted.  We&#x27;ve owned it @ 2 years and have had no sparks, smells, etc.</li>
    <li> This product is crap. I should have read the reviews! It is so loud you need earplugs to dry your hair. The cord won&#x27;t retract with out an extended battle. DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second one of these. It works great! The diffuser is better than many I&#x27;ve seen. The retractable cord works great. The dryer stopped working before the retractor and I used it every time I dried my hair! Quick and easy. Just push the button and up it comes. It&#x27;s also foldable for easy storage in a suitcase. Lasted for about 5 years before I needed a new one.</li>
