<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This item may be a little cumbersome (definitely not for travel) But it really does work to achieve a clean mouth and is recommended by every dentist I&#x27;ve ever gone to.</li>
    <li> Used to own a Waterpik years ago . . . this one is better . . .</li>
    <li> I use this every day.</li>
    <li> A bit more cumbersome than traditional flossing but well worth the effort.  My mouth feels much cleaner.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. I have been using a month now and seems to do its job.</li>
    <li> Fantastic!!Out of my expectation!I use it everyday now~Feels fresh after using it.</li>
    <li> not happy small model ,ill buy at bed and bath in future-to see what i&#x27;m getting</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad they have started marketing the water pik as a flosser.  More people will buy it and use it.  Great defense against gum disease.</li>
    <li> I should have bought this many years ago and am glad that I did.  I love the massaging effect and the pressure from the fine tip.</li>
    <li> DOES A EXCELLEMNT JOB. DENTIST  RECOMMED IT</li>
    <li> I wish the hose was longer and the water container was larger but other than that I love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I needed to get the food particles I couldn&#x27;t reach with floss removed.</li>
    <li> LOVE my waterpik.  This particular unit, while maybe not the smallest one on the market, is a nice size, not too big, and the white fits in well with pretty much any decor.  Basically, it is a nice design for an appliance, with very clean lines - and it is easy to use, once one figures out the right angle so as not to dribble all over PJs.  I thought it would be a pain to add this to the hygiene schedule, but I feel a real difference and, oddly, actually don&#x27;t mind the daily task.</li>
    <li> This has been a fantastic water pik!  So much better than the last one I had.</li>
    <li> LIke it very much, may buy another for a Christmas present</li>
    <li> Waterpik saves my gum from the evil plaque and food in places you&#x27;d never think would be stuck there.</li>
    <li> It make my live easier.</li>
    <li> I just got my braces put on, and so far I have found the best cleaner for my teeth Works the best with the orthodontics tip!!</li>
    <li> Should have gotten one of these a long time ago. My mouth has never felt so clean before. If you don&#x27;t own one get one. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I love this.  Never used one before so I have nothing to compare it with.&lt;br /&gt;My Husband likes it as well. Will see how it goes with my next Dental appointment and give more feedback.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Waterpik model for about 7 months now. It works the same since the day I bought it. No leaks, weird issues, or problems. I haven&#x27;t experimented too much with the Pik types that are included. and I generally keep the water pressure setting at a 3/4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like my teeth and gum health are cleaner and more healthy. For those who don&#x27;t want to string floss, this is the way to go!</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with the flosser, below is what I&#x27;ve found out:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- this thing does not substitute a tooth brush&lt;br /&gt;- probably it would be a good option for people with brackets&lt;br /&gt;- has no special room to keep the nozzles so its a bit of inconvenient if you&#x27;re not alone using flosser&lt;br /&gt;- power &amp;#62;8 is really hard with you gums&lt;br /&gt;- pretty noisy and if you&#x27;re not careful you&#x27;re gonna end up with water splatters all over the mirror and bathroom</li>
    <li> really good. use it after meal and breath fresh.</li>
    <li> received good product and will buy again/</li>
    <li> recommended by hygienist - replacing old &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; model - we&#x27;ll see in 6 mo. if it&#x27;s made a difference - so far seems to be doing the job</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT!!  I use it several times a day and it is helping with my periodontal problems.  It is also recommended by my dentist.</li>
    <li> I had a Waterpik Ultra; this seems like a cleaner design.  Much lighter than the Ultra; more responsive motor.  The lid and storage are attached to the base so you can&#x27;t misplace the lid and all the attachments within.  Also, the &amp;#34;pause&amp;#34; button on the old Ultra (basically a mechanical water cutoff) eventually gets stuck and blocks the water flow.  Hopefully the switch on this new model isn&#x27;t prone to the same problem.</li>
    <li> Gave one Waterpik to my daughter and bought one for myself. Both of us love it. Cleans teeth very well. Keeps gums healthy.</li>
    <li> Very please with the product</li>
    <li> much better than my older waterpik.  It also has more capabilities.</li>
    <li> very good well made item.  Last one lasted 9 years.</li>
    <li> Button to turn on on the pick itself really hard so don&#x27;t use it. Use main power. Ever thing else very good. Love the choice of picks</li>
    <li> Great...wife loves it.</li>
    <li> Leaves my teeth clean, nothing else to say! Works so much better than floss. I have no issues and wish I had purchased years ago.</li>
    <li> A must-have if you tend toward gum problems. Also a must if you have bridges or implants!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS.  No one should be without one.  The y make your mouth feel very fresh and clean.  Use warm water and it is wonderful.  After brushing I find this still finds particles between my teeth.  AWESOME</li>
    <li> It works well for kids with braces.  instead of trying to floss around the hardware, it Flushes everything out. Nice that it has different levels of pulse strength. It is a bit messy</li>
    <li> A little disappointed water leaks from grip slightly</li>
    <li> It works well and is reliable. Clean teeth for all</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> use it daily cleans pretty good</li>
    <li> Old one died and this new one I love even better.</li>
    <li> Worked fine for about a month and then it coughed two or three times and died. Unfortunately, too late to return through Amazon and I am contacting the manufacturer to see if they will take it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now contacted Waterpik and they are sending a new one out for me and I don&#x27;t have to return the old broken unit.  If it works fine I will amend my review and assume it was just a defective unit.</li>
    <li> I thought some parts of my gum were receding.  It was sore and inflamed.  After using this product the inflammation went away and the gum grew back.  I love this product.  It also got rid of plaque build up and does a good job preventing it from forming.  I floss first, then brush, then use the Waterpik.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Works great fast delivery</li>
    <li> The button on the actual pic is hard to turn off and on, it is a pain. I have another pik from another manufacturer and it is much better.</li>
    <li> Great product, had one before and lost when moved, so happy to have another one</li>
    <li> I really do NOT recommend it! The On/ Off switch on the handle  leaks badly. It is very noisy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this unit less than a week. I had the previous model (100) for several years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the things I like better about this model:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Switch on handle. The button on the old model would get stuck all the time. On the new unit, you have to be careful not to hit the switch that releases the tip...you will have water all over the place. I haven&#x27;t found the power switch on the handle difficult to operate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I like the way the reservoir is situated on this model. Easier to remove and fill with water. I don&#x27;t care about the tip storage. Perhaps that&#x27;s more important for a family. I&#x27;m the only one who uses this unit. The reservoir cover also had slots so perhaps it will air it out better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. I like the handle holder better on this one. The old one would crack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  I like the new, streamlined look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve only had it for a while I can&#x27;t vouch for any reliability or mechanical issues yet. With my last Waterpik the company was very responsive when it came to sending out replacement units and parts when I had a problem.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, it stopped working after a month and a half. Unfortunatly it only has a 30 day return policy. The machine works great if it would only last. It seems that the pump got clogged.</li>
    <li> My mouth feels like I have had a dental visit.  Gums are looking healthier.  I highly recommend.  Worth every penny and much cheaper than dentures.</li>
    <li> For those of you unfamiliar with this device, it is an electric toothbrush, which takes the following approach to teeth cleaning.  Spray a fluid with pulsing and high velocity, and it should clean as well as or better than a conventional toothbrush and floss.  I recently lost a crown, possibly due in part because of a tight space between the crown and the neighboring tooth.  My dentist enthusiastically recommend this device, and claimed that there are studies who claim that use of this device is as good or better than conventional brushing and flossing. After spending so much $ on reparative work, for this price, let me try it out.  I am desperate.  OK, not perfect.  Use once for 5 minutes per 2 hours.  Sprays about.  Still learning how to use it.  How will it hold up over time?  How well will I keep the reservoir and device clean?  For now, it seems to work well.  It seems to clean well.  I warm up water for reservoir in a microwave container in a microwave oven.  My initial impression: If it holds up, until someone engineers a better / stronger device, it seems to do what it is expected to do, and I perceive that this a better than what I had been using for my dental hygiene.  And the cost of the device is IMO quite reasonable (w 3Y warranty).</li>
    <li> Great product, especially after getting a replacement from the first one that leaked water when it was on. Contacted amazon and got a new one the next day!</li>
    <li> the voltage is inconvenient for China, here is 220v, need a converter.&lt;br /&gt;and my first time using water flosser, the water everywhere... ...&lt;br /&gt;at last I bought a electric toothbrush and use them both.</li>
    <li> Number one product for keeping your teeth and mouth oders in check&lt;br /&gt;Had a problem with the machine&lt;br /&gt;They sent me out a new one the next day&lt;br /&gt;Bought another one for my son</li>
    <li> Messy, not very effective</li>
    <li> gave as gift to Grandma, but we LOVE our own waterpiks, love them!  :)</li>
    <li> Bought it for a teen with braces and it works like a charm.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it uses it 2x a day</li>
    <li> Works very well in all ways, much better than the older model WaterPick I&#x27;d had for 5-6 years.</li>
    <li> I like this product. It does not substitute flossing but make you feel fresh and heathy</li>
    <li> Love It. Have to more to share with friends.</li>
    <li> Brush with electric spinning sonicare, floss and am usually surprised when using water flosser at additional debris it flushes out.</li>
    <li> The product was excellent I decided since I had the pressure at the lowest setting and it was plenty strong for my needs I would trade it for the waterpik plus which is rechargeable with 2 settings for convenience. The only poor review of the Waterpik plus was in relation to the pressure so I tried the Waterpik Aquarius and it was strong enough on the lowest setting, plus, I don;t have a good electrical outlet in my bathroom, so the rechargeable should perfectly meet my needs. I got the best price at Wal-mart on line.</li>
    <li> Wonderful adjunct to brushing, amazing how food particles get wedge between teeth that brush missed..love it</li>
    <li> works well so far. have been using for one month now but be aware. this unit has an American 120v power source so you need to purchase a 240v to 120v power converter to use in oz.</li>
    <li> great product, clean your teeth very well</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It can get up quite a lot of pressure on the higher settings, and I really do feel refreshed after using it. It is a little bit noisy when it&#x27;s going, but I tend to dampen that by placing a hand towel under the base. I have never used a water flosser before this one, so I can&#x27;t comment on the changes between this model and the last one that some reviewers have noted.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect waterpik. I&#x27;m hope it has a travel size too</li>
    <li> It works for me. Had my teeth cleaned recently and my dentist said was a big improvement on previous visit I have the cordless version as well. I prefer this one. Does a better job</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like a power washer for your mouth!</li>
    <li> This is a great alternative to regular flossing. I thought that my teeth were very clean considering how much I floss/brush. After a couple years without going to the dentist plaque is bound to build between teeth. I cranked this at full power and flossed after, my teeth feel completely clean. Be careful with the pressure though, I sprayed my tongue by accident and it is still quite raw after a couple days. Be careful with your gums as well</li>
    <li> works well, easy to use</li>
    <li> THE FEATURES ARE NEAT I&#x27;M SURE IT WILL WORK AS WELL AS MY OLDER VERSION. I HAVE NOT TAKEN IT OUT OF THE BOX YET.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son and he loves it!!</li>
    <li> So much better than the previous version and a very welcome feature it is significantly quieter too.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this Waterpik and I have to say it&#x27;s an amazing product. I&#x27;ve never been a daily flosser but ever since purchasing this item I haven&#x27;t missed a day. It is very easy and convenient to use, it has cleaned and dislodged food that my toothbrush and regular floss wasn&#x27;t able to get, and it feels great on my gums. I like to add in a splash of mouthwash to the water each time I use the machine and it does a great job of leaving my mouth, gums, and teeth feeling very fresh and clean. My only regret is not purchasing one of these sooner. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy to have bought it, I rinse my teeth after supper everyday now. I think it works well .Although I brush my teeth after every meal  before , I still don&#x27;t feel the mouth is very clean,  But now I can feel my mouth is clean and comfortable.</li>
    <li> Seems to work... Dental appt. in two weeks, we&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> Very good product, I should have bought this years ago.</li>
    <li> Wow works great on my gums they feel and look much better, I actually spend more time cleaning my teeth... has helped me become more responsible with dental hygiene... I still use dental floss but I feel that I cover all my bases to better dental health</li>
    <li> Never used a water flosser before.  Was surprised at just how much water gets everywhere when it&#x27;s in use, and how noisy it is.  But it beats flossing with a wax string. Variable control is good to have.  Multiple tips - not so much - never use anything but the one basic tip.</li>
    <li> Highly satisfied, excellent item, prompt delivery</li>
    <li> I just started using it, and I realize this may be a fantastic product in every way, but.. the cord that the device is attached is so short.  I try to use it and it pulls on the body of it and has tipped the whole thing over at least twice.  If I find out that I&#x27;m missing something obvious I&#x27;ll go back and make this 4 or 5 stars, but this is a very agitating design flaw from what I can tell.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik works great. It&#x27;s a great flosser and recommended by my dental hygienist. It sets up easily, and can be started to work in a minute or two. The only downside I find is that the water tank doesn&#x27;t last as long as I like it to, but then again, I use it at practically full blast and like to floss to the point that I am sure I get every little spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to set up&lt;br /&gt;- Straight forward to use&lt;br /&gt;- Customizable power.&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to refill tank&lt;br /&gt;- Relatively easy to keep clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t disassemble well to clean (Water feels trapped in there and difficult to get out, worries me about cleanliness later on)&lt;br /&gt;- Water tank doesn&#x27;t reserve as much water as I like it to, and you pretty much have to stop everything to refill the tank then start up again&lt;br /&gt;- Wires can easily get tangled up if you have to put it away every time you use it.</li>
    <li> This is a very useful device especially for people like me who has dental work.&lt;br /&gt;I have dental crown fitted and often food particle stuck around it, I tried to extract those food particles with string floss but many a times in vain without any success or actual removal of the stuck particles, which then in couple of days culminates to gum swelling, pain and bleeding. Also sometimes I worry using string floss as dailly pulling and pushing forces against the dental work may actually damage the crown work in long run.&lt;br /&gt;Then bought this product and it worked great for me by saving my dentist visit and paying off almost the investment I made in this product on very first use.&lt;br /&gt;The default tips that come with this product is generally enough for single person user. that too mostly I use jet tip(Not the ultra pik). If any other family member is planning to use this machine then you should order extra jet tips(In-case you don&#x27;t want to share your original jet tip with others).&lt;br /&gt;I did ordered ultra pik tip but I think I over invested in those. As they eject very fine water pressure jet. and I don&#x27;t think anybody will ever use these in family including myself.&lt;br /&gt;I use it at the setting of 4-5... any thing above 6 is too much water jet pressure for gum to manage in long run.&lt;br /&gt;I surely recommend these product to anybody who has dental work like crown/bridge/braces done to there teeths. This is a must have for your tooth and gum care for your family.</li>
    <li> The hose is constantly being twisted. Water seems to go every where. I don&#x27;t like the capacity of the water tank. I would not recommend this model</li>
    <li> Cleans better than my standard Waterpik. Construction is rather flimsy; feels like it could fall apart if not carefully handled.</li>
    <li> Nice and wokks well to my teeth</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Waterpik for almost 14 years and this is the best one yet.  So easy to use!</li>
    <li> Great value, quality, and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Love the new adaptations they&#x27;ve made. Easier to use.</li>
    <li> PRICED RIGHT &amp; WORK WELL.</li>
    <li> I REALLY  LIKE IT. It came fast</li>
    <li> I like this thing because I hate flossing. The first couple of days I had sore gums from using it but now I can crank it up and my teeth and gums feel cleaner. I doubt this is as good as the dentist tools that they use, but it works just fine for me. I also no longer have to floss so I am happy.</li>
    <li> Never work. I just plug it in the socket and didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Highly reccommended by our dentist the Waterpik seems to be doing everything it is supposed to do. Delivery was prompt, set-up&lt;br /&gt;very easy and using it is simple, it takes about 2 min. a day to use.</li>
    <li> Teeth feel much cleaner.  Can&#x27;t believe all the crud I was missing between my teeth.  It is a good tool but one still must floss.</li>
    <li> On/off switch on handle awkward to use.  The push button to turn on/off on the base requires enough pressure to move the base away from you.  Maybe I&#x27;ll get used to it.</li>
    <li> I like that the newer model do not have the extra water piks on top.  It is easier to attach when using.</li>
    <li> Super great product. Works very well. My teeth have never been cleaner.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  My son uses it to help keep his braces and teeth clean and it works well.  Shipped incredibly fast!</li>
    <li> I love this waterpik, works great and makes my teeth feel so clean</li>
    <li> This is my second waterpik. The first one lasted about 1.5 years before the cable wear off. I hope this time it lasts a little longer.</li>
    <li> Works great.  The little tube stays nice and curled and it is very compact and not hard to use.  You will get wet when you first start using it but once you get the hang of it your teeth and gums will feel so much better.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference.  I recommend this product to anyone that brushes their teeth!</li>
    <li> So far much better than fancier model I had for a year. The lid is hinged so it doesn&#x27;t drop in by accident. Switch on handle is great. Smaller profile is always a bathroom plus. I don&#x27;t know if it will last. The fancier model did not last. The warranty is 3 years.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and works flosslessly (pun) The only not so good is that the manufacturer should make less noisy. Easy to clean and fill.</li>
    <li> It was exactly as I expected and needed.</li>
    <li> OMG.  I can&#x27;t imagine going back to not owning a water flosser.  My mouth has never felt better / healthier / cleaner!  This thing is great.  To be honest, this is my first water flosser, so I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it to, but it does what it is supposed to do.  It has a large tank size, plenty of tips, and more pressure settings than I&#x27;ll ever use.  (10 &#x3D; ouch)</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a 40 yr old waterpik.  I like the modern design, tho, it holds less water--but sufficient for the job.  It comes with extra piks, but I find I like the original pik the best.  I don&#x27;t need the &amp;#34;pauses&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Every household should have at least one of these. I was just introduced to them due to my adult braces. It is weird on how they expect you to use the diverse heads of the pik but once you choose the one you need, things will be downhill... It is of good quality, strong build and ease to use. One thing I do to make things happy is to use hot/warm water to fill the tank, else it will be an unpleasant ride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Amazon.com is the Earth&#x27;s Most Customer-Centric Company.Best!!!!!</li>
    <li> Just What I needed. Very efficient and great for teeth. A++++</li>
    <li> what a wonderful purchase&amp;#60;works very well, feels like a just left dentist office</li>
    <li> been using a waterpik for almost 25 years.  I recently purchased this one under advice of my dentist.  I have dental implants and it&#x27;s difficult to clean between the crown and the gums, this works great for keeping that hear to reach area well irrigated and clean.</li>
    <li> Much nicer than the previous version as it takes up less space and works just as well.</li>
    <li> Love this little machine!  Flossing is becoming problematic with me due to problems with my hands.  I got this machine for when I was unable to floss, but now use it all the time - either on it&#x27;s own or in addition to flossing.  This seems to do a much BETTER job &amp;#34;flossing&amp;#34; below the gum line than manual flossing, and an equivalent job flossing between teeth, with the possible exception of needing to manually floss if something gets stuck between teeth.  AND, added unexpected bonus!  My teeth proper are much cleaner, whiter, smoother in just the two weeks I&#x27;ve been using Waterpik.  So it appears to be helping to clean my teeth better than my electric toothbrush alone, and I had always thought there wasn&#x27;t ANYTHING better than my electric toothbrush!!</li>
    <li> awesome machine for someone with braces or just has sensitive teeth/gum.. you can adjust the water pressure  and comes with a few extra tips for a variety of different jobs on your gums and teeth.. i been using it for a few weeks now and i can honestly say it does amazing job cleaning...</li>
    <li> vender is really good to get the product to me in a timely manner. packaged well. does a pretty decent job cleaning the small crevices in between the teeth.</li>
    <li> After using the device for several weeks, I find the most difficult part of using single stream jet tip to along gum line is the angle of the head is fixed and makes it very very difficult to effectively work  around back to the front teeth, top of mouth. Also, same for molars such as wisdom teeth at extreme back, both top and bottom. Using Plax to looses plaque with thorough rinsing prior to using Waterpick seems to be a good combination.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Waterpiks for about 30 years and this is one of the best. It does not take up a lot of room on the counter, is powerful, and well-designed. The water tank is easy to remove, fill, or empty and easily rests on the stand (don&#x27;t have to press down to form a seal with the stand -- very important).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this product.</li>
    <li> I have had four oral irrigation products in the past, all of which eventually broke or were not powerful enough to do the job.  This one is BY FAR, the best.  Its adjustable flow allows you to choose the amount of power.  It&#x27;s easily powerful enough to blast any debris out from between teeth and gums.  I haven&#x27;t found the pulse/massage feature all that useful but I prefer the more continuous power.  I would definitely buy this product again and would also recommend it to anyone looking for an improvement in their oral hygeine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have crowded teeth so flossing always ends up cutting my gums in the front and the picks can&#x27;t get between the lower crowded teeth.  Warning to anyone who buys this.  Start off at the lower settings or you will see blood.  I generally brush with toothpaste followed by a quick brush with a few squirts of hydrogen peroxide and a final rinse with the Water Flosser.  This seems to keep my teeth clean and white, and my gums trouble free.</li>
    <li> Does the job well.  Many different tips to choose from.</li>
    <li> Perfect size and works great</li>
    <li> I use my Waterpik everyday and it works excellent with bridge work. would not be without it.</li>
    <li> finally the right one</li>
    <li> Does a good job of cleaning teeth.  I like the storage for two tips in the lid and the hose coils back to it&#x27;s receptacle so it&#x27;s out of the way.</li>
    <li> This product outstandingI I am so glad I purchased this product  and would highly recommend it for oral hygiene</li>
    <li> A must have for anyone with braces. The waterpik was purchased for my 12 year old a few days before her braces were applied. While brushing 3 times per day, she has been able to use it (at least once daily) without creating a mess and finds it to be more helpful than flossing in most cases. Her younger sister has started to use the other tips because she thought it looked fun! I would absolutely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Thank you - love the waterpic!</li>
    <li> Great appliance, somehow I had two shipped to me, must return one, or give as a gift. My dentist recommended this and I can tell a difference in just a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> Really good. Hard to press the on/off button though.</li>
    <li> works as expected and it is our second one.  The only weird thing is there is no holder for the detachable brushes.  I put mine in a baggy in the bathroom drawer.  No big deal.</li>
    <li> It was a replacement for an older model.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik Aquarius Water Flosser cleans between your teeth &amp; under the gum line like regular flossing can&#x27;t. It is likes trip to the dentist !</li>
    <li> Good...Not as strong as my first one; however does the job.</li>
    <li> Love water picks and this is a nice one.  The only problems are it makes a lot of noise and the on button is really hard to push.</li>
    <li> I never used to floss, and still my cleanings were a quick scrape and a finger wag about not flossing.  Big deal.  I pay you to floss my teeth twice a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the last couple of cleanings were an exercise in torment, I finally had to admit to myself that not flossing just wasn&#x27;t going to cut it now that I&#x27;m getting old or something.  Who knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate flossing.  It takes forever, it tastes like fingers and blood, and my worst teeth for tartar deposits are also my hardest teeth to reach with fingers and string.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to address the issue without making myself totally miserable, and thus I did some research into floss alternatives.  I ended up buying the Waterpik Aquarius, and I use it twice a day.  I haven&#x27;t been to the dentist yet, but I&#x27;m going to be shocked if he doesn&#x27;t pat me on the head for improving my home care.  My teeth sure feel cleaner, and the process of using the thing is exponentially less miserable and at least an order of magnitude faster than using string floss.  Plus I don&#x27;t have piles of bloody string laying around in the trash can for the dogs to knock over and drag everywhere.  Win win.</li>
    <li> Love it! Cleans really well and works as expected.</li>
    <li> As a WaterPik addict when my old one stop working I replace it with this one. I like it ever better.</li>
    <li> Makes my mouth feel super clean</li>
    <li> tricky to use at first....just takes practice!! LOVE THIS!!</li>
    <li> The handle leaks unless you run it till it&#x27;s empty after you&#x27;re done. Otherwise, much improved and a great unit.</li>
    <li> First time buy! Feel clean after use. Amazing product!</li>
    <li> I like it very much, it works well!</li>
    <li> Works great and actually make flossing enjoyable.</li>
    <li> ORIGINAL REVIEW Dec. 29, 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is day one with my new Waterpik Aquarius (bought with some Christmas money from a \\&quot;Daily Deal\\&quot; listing on Amazon). So far, I&#x27;ve tried it twice, and I&#x27;ll use it again before bed. This is mostly to practice the technique, but maybe also a bit because it&#x27;s kind of fun to use. Most importantly, however, it does appear to work as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re new to this device like I am, remember to start at the lowest pressure setting and work up from there. Find the highest comfortable setting and use that. If it hurts, stop and turn the thing down a bit. And use WARM water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I got this Waterpik. I already use a Sonicare brush, so this is a nice addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE Jan. 15, 2015&lt;br /&gt;Waterpik guarantees results within two weeks, so I kept that in mind and decided I&#x27;d comment on it here. It might not matter now that there are so many more reviews. Nobody may ever see this one, hehe. Anyway, they weren&#x27;t kidding at Waterpik: well within the two-week limit, my gums were in better condition, and my teeth are certainly cleaner around the edges. I&#x27;m sold: this is a good investment.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik works beautifully and is serving its purpose well.</li>
    <li> I have used Water pik for many years and got very good result. But this one which I purchased on Jan 2015 gave me a terrible experience: the tip can not be held so when you turn on the water flosser, the tip will drop down. Do not buy this one, try to buy the old model!</li>
    <li> The only reason this Waterpik didn&#x27;t get 5 stars from me is it is very loud. Which is not a performance issue, just annoying. It works great though! It comes with several attachments to use, has both floss and massage settings, on/off on the handle, very easy to use, and multiple settings to determine how fast/hard the water comes out of it.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Works better than flossing.</li>
    <li> So far I really like it although I wish it had more power.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Bought for my daughter who got braces.  Solves all the problems of not being able to floss.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a gift for my boyfriend and he uses it all the time!  His dentist says his teeth are getting healthier!</li>
    <li> Works well…still getting use to it, but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still getting used to using my Waterpik Water Flosser and am hoping that by using it daily my receding gums will become more and more healthy so that I can avoid having any oral surgeries! It seems to be working perfectly as it dislodges food particles that my Sonicare electric toothbrush has missed.</li>
    <li> Given as a gift. My grand-daughter was very pleased.</li>
    <li> This works like a charm! I got with my new braces and shag a difference!</li>
    <li> My Dentist recommended I get a Waterpik because I&#x27;m not a huge fan of flossing my tooth and this thing works great! I can see it working when the chunks of food that I don&#x27;t even realize are between my teeth come out.</li>
    <li> I like that you can adjust the pressure and that it really gets your mouth clean. I started on a lower setting and now I can use the highest setting without any discomfort or bleeding. I just don&#x27;t feel I&#x27;ve done the job for my teeth if I don&#x27;t use it. I gave it 4 stars because I wish the water tube was longer so I didn&#x27;t have to bend over when using it.</li>
    <li> Excellent , works great , results amazing , highly recommended</li>
    <li> So easy to use, My mouth always feel so much clean. borderline addiction! I like how it is compact and easy to keep out without taking up much space.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and works well</li>
    <li> Received the Waterpik in the time allotted and it seems to be working great.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it enough to honestly provide a response.</li>
    <li> excellent choice for a water flosser. Works great.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully and as intended.</li>
    <li> Very good. Purchase a gift to my parents again</li>
    <li> Great large water container! This updated version is an improvement over an older style I have been using.</li>
    <li> My friend asked me to buy this for him.Only three weeks.USA TO CHINA.Buying stuff overseas is cheap and fun.The world is smaller.</li>
    <li> works great. very happy</li>
    <li> Wonderful! Cant complain, works perfect!</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I needed!! It isn&#x27;t as loud as my old Waterpik.  Considering how many years it lasted, I figure this will last quite a while.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to expect, as this is my first.  Food removal between teeth is great. Massages the gums well.  Included is an array of tips to suit your purpose.  The only con is the noise and vibration of the unit.  Practice makes perfect, at times I&#x27;ll move the handle from one side to the other, spraying the mirror or wall or the kids when its a &amp;#34;what&#x27;s that Dad?&amp;#34; moment.</li>
    <li> Multiple attachments are great. I love the toothbrush head. I use it after using floss tip. It works great. Love that you can use mouthwash in reservoir.&lt;br /&gt;Much easier than regular flossing. I am very happy that I bought this.</li>
    <li> Does everything it says it will. Good quality</li>
    <li> Great item, but has a mass amount of advertisement that is BS, not totally wrong--just not entirely true.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fantastic. I&#x27;ve had an old one for years and loved it, but this one is a big improvement. It&#x27;s quieter than the old one, smaller, and easier to use. I read some reviews on it that thought the water reservoir was too small, but I have no problem at all and almost always have some water left over after I&#x27;ve given my teeth a thorough water flossing.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Still seems to work the same as the blue/white one.  he does not like to floss, so this is a great alternative.  (though should still not be your primary way of flossing).  Great for using to brush teeth too, not just the floss function.</li>
    <li> Every family should have one.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik Aquarius WP-660 is a great product.  I read all the reviews on Amazon before purchasing, and even purchased the older model for my daughter so that I could compare the two.  I like the Aquarius over the older model because it is smaller.  The lid is attached to the frame so you can pop it back and take out the bowl.  On the older version the lid is not attached, so you must remove both the bowl and lid to fill it.  The older version also holds more fluid and takes up more space and is just a bit heavier.  Some complained about the pick holder being smaller and harder to manage on this newer model, I find nothing wrong with it.  They are both noisy and I don&#x27;t know why with today&#x27;s technology that could not have been fixed.  I started using it on level 2 and now I am up to level 6.  I also add Listerine with Alcohol and have not had any problems.</li>
    <li> I could not believe how much residue was washed out of my teeth!</li>
    <li> I should probably give this device five stars, but just can&#x27;t make myself do it, only because the little thing is so light and cheap feeling, (Design tip: Maybe instead of being tall, it should be wide.) the little curly spring-like hose pulls on the unit, and I&#x27;ve had it tip over.  The only setting I use is max, but that&#x27;s just me, (I&#x27;m a pretty big, 50 yr old man.) all the lower settings are so low, they&#x27;re pretty useless.  (Keeping in mind they&#x27;re probably good for kids on those lower settings.)  Comes with a couple toothbrush like heads, but they&#x27;re so small and dainty, again, worthless for an adult, but maybe good for cleaning kids, or maybe baby teeth, I would like to see a real manly toothbrush included, one that feels substantial; overall, this thing is okay, but feels a little bit like a cheap plastic kids toy to me; but I use it regularly, and I guess I like it overall.  I looked hard all over the Internet, and couldn&#x27;t find anything I thought I would like better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to see them come out with a model designed and marketed just for big old guys like me.  A big, heavy, (wide, not tall) high pressure unit, with a long-flexible hose, and big solid very manly toothbrushes, I&#x27;d pay extra for something designed like that just for me. (Put a warning on it, that says, &amp;#34;Not for kids! Adults only!&amp;#34; And actually mean it!)  This device seems to be trying to accommodate children and adults in the same unit, and it just falls short to master either...well, I take that back, this is a probably a pretty good little unit for kids...if they can keep from knocking it over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would say this is a kids device, that tries to accommodate adults; leaves me wishing for something better though.</li>
    <li> Pro:&lt;br /&gt;- More powerful than the older hand-held cordless model that I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;- Much more noisy than the older hand-held cordless model that I had.&lt;br /&gt;- Water reservoir good for only 2 floss (I was hoping 3)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Waterpik is simply the best.  This one has more power than my previous version and it&#x27;s simpler to use.  I like the fact that the top is attached and all you have to do is flip it up.  Would recommend it to anyone looking for a flossing solution.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 14 yr old son who recently got braces. He loves it and is actually spending more time on his oral hygiene routine. It come with many different tools and even has a timer so you know your flossing enough. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> If you have braces, this is a must have!</li>
    <li> This was a gift. She said it was a little difficult to get used to and now loves  it. Had a small problem at first spraying water all over the place.once you get it figured out it great. Really cleans the junk out between teeth and massages gums&lt;br /&gt;Feels clean after you are done</li>
    <li> would have given it 4 stars but the switch that powers it is extremely hard to turn on and off</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist was right - brushing and flossing doesn&#x27;t get it all.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made. This product does an amazing job flossing my teeth. I would never floss in the past, which led to constant trips to the dentist. Now I floss daily, and my gums have never been so pink. Highly recommend, I plan on purchasing a couple of these for the family come the holidays.</li>
    <li> I got it in the mail very quickly and it worked perfectly out of the box.  I can&#x27;t stop using it - it&#x27;s so satisfying to use.  My teeth don&#x27;t allow for easy flossing (I still do it as best as possible) so this has been a big improvement.  I&#x27;ve noticed an immediate change in my breath throughout the day.  Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> A great buy for the price.  Item works as described and was shipped fast.</li>
    <li> Love this water pik. Easy to use &amp; works great. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> met all expectations.</li>
    <li> Great product, you just have to use it.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT. MY HUSBAND LOVES IT.</li>
    <li> Got for granddaughters expander. Needs a way to turn down water flow</li>
    <li> Replaced an older water pik that didn&#x27;t have enough water force.  This works great with a pulsing action that really gets food particles from between teeth.</li>
    <li> Works really well.  Ease to use.</li>
    <li> Works great. controls are a little stiff/hard  to turn on and off.  But other than that I like it.</li>
    <li> Worked great for 1 year and now the attachments won&#x27;t stay in place for use.  Very frustrating!</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it states.</li>
    <li> Where to have new heads of the brushes when they are broken?</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave anything for the dentist!!!</li>
    <li> I just wish the resevoir was bigger. But then it wouldnt be as conveniently compact as it is... If you really enjoy water flossing, expect to have to refill the resevoir if you set the pressure to max. I have to refill it 1-2 times before I&#x27;m done. Other than that, totally satisfied with this thing.</li>
    <li> I love this item but the start button is hard to push on.</li>
    <li> Good!!&lt;br /&gt;Quality, Performance and so on. Very good</li>
    <li> grateful&#x27;I like it very much</li>
    <li> Since I made this part of cleaning regimen, teeth are much cleaner and no cavaties!</li>
    <li> I love it and it was the best price too!</li>
    <li> Worked well- even after daily use for several months. Arrived packaged well in perfect shape. This item has been fantastic for my daughter with braces.</li>
    <li> Best thing since sliced bread.  I received this right after my last cleaning and when I went in last week for my latest cleaning my hygienist accused me of having had my teeth cleaned before I saw her, then I told her I bought this.</li>
    <li> Not easy to control, I got my clothes wet every time I use it.</li>
    <li> Pretty loud running.....switch on wand is difficult to slide On and Off. Other than that, it does work very well.</li>
    <li> Product is very good&lt;br /&gt;Do not regret my choice&lt;br /&gt;You should buy this really good</li>
    <li> This is the first water flosser I&#x27;ve ever used so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.  I do really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fill the reservoir twice each time I &#x27;floss&#x27; and use one reservoir for the upper teeth and the other for the lower teeth.  I have sprayed the mirror a few times because I&#x27;ve forgotten to use the on/off switch that&#x27;s located in the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to a friend or family member.</li>
    <li> Works really well to dislodge food particles from teeth and gums.  Does not replace flossing per my dentist.</li>
    <li> I really like this waterpik!</li>
    <li> You will be happy with this product if you are ok with spending 2 minutes of your time water-flossing your teeth, and spending 10 minutes of your time trying to re-coil the cheap plastic hose back into the holder, you will be happy with this product.  I threw out my 4-yr old water pick, which was working perfectly well, thinking they would have fixed this annoying problem, but no!!!  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product until they fix the hose problem.  You are better off just swishing water with a plastic cup.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended a Waterpik to help battle plaque.  I like the features of this model: changeable tips, dual pulse modes, handy tip holder and the reservoir is easy to fill. Works well though a bit noisy, but not annoyingly so.</li>
    <li> came with extra pick&#x27;s, easy to remove, fill and clean. Cord storage is fine also.</li>
    <li> Love it! Does what it says.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as advertised and really makes my mouth feel clean and refreshed.</li>
    <li> Should have known about this sooner would have bought it. Maybe not the best looking teeth on the block but the cleanest.</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist recommended that I use a water flosser after she noticed increased plaque buildup over my past two visits. I chose this model because of its price, many features and the many positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like what this device does and how it does it. There is a learning curve involved in using a water flosser effectively, and I&#x27;m still learning. But unlike many, I still use waxed floss (also as recommended by my hygienist), which helps maintain healthy gums. I recommend that you check with your dentist before deciding to completely drop using floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s really not much else to say other than what others have detailed. In that regard, I highly recommend that you consider using a water flosser. The Waterpik Aquarius has lots of features and comes with several different tips to suit your particular needs. The profile is not large or obtrusive, so it&#x27;s easily stored on a counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully, the next visit to my dental hygienist will result in less work for her.</li>
    <li> I wish I had this 30 years ago! I love how well it cleans my teeth.</li>
    <li> Bought it last August, worked well initially, it failed in less than a year.</li>
    <li> I floss twice daily and yet I had the constant complaint that the floss was not reaching low enough on a capped tooth.  No matter how much I flossed I felt that there was still a stale odor.  The Waterpik was recommended.  I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without it.  my breath is always fresh.  I put about a tablespoon or so of hydrogen peroxide in the water.  Kills germs in both the mouth and machine. I love this pik so much that I plan on buying it for all my siblings for Christmas!</li>
    <li> I have put off getting one of these for a longtime. I love this product. Shipped fast excellent machine. would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. It does a great job of removing food from between teeth,  The best feature for me is the variable power available.&lt;br /&gt;The device I had before was making my mouth bleed. I like the design much better than other brands that I have tried.</li>
    <li> It is a good  choice.</li>
    <li> Works well, though it&#x27;s quite loud.  I recommend turning on the switch and letting the water shoot out the nozzle for a bit prior to each use in order to cycle out any water left in the system.</li>
    <li> Doing wonderful.  My granddaughter got a glowing report from her dentist!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;I have teeth that are very close together and flossing has always been difficult for me. I always got pieces of floss stuck between my teeth and I could never get everything out from between my teeth. The Water Flosser has changed everything. It is so easy, just fill the tank, pick your head, and go. It easily cleans between my teeth and sprays out everything that was stuck and I mean everything (even pieces of dental floss). My mouth feels so clean afterwards it is way better than flossing. I&#x27;m not sure if it is actually better for you than regular flossing as I am not a dentist but when I use the Waterpik after flossing, there is always more stuff that comes out that the regular floss didn&#x27;t get. Its kind of gross how much stuff gets stuck between your teeth that you don&#x27;t even know is there but the Waterpik finds it and gets rid of it.</li>
    <li> I love this flosser. I was skeptical in the beginning, but I had an upcoming dental appointment 1 month after this flosser arrived. I floss every day once at night...sometime twice....but I got the best check up. I flossed with dental floss in the past but it was always difficult to do it right, for me. With this flosser, I use warm water to clean between my teeth, using a the full amount of water and feel confident I am getting all the food. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Great product. It might be a good idea to have on a plastic apron during use as water sometimes trickle on your clothes.</li>
    <li> Died at 4 months old.  And, no, water scale isn&#x27;t what killed it.  It doesn&#x27;t get power when power button is pressed.</li>
    <li> meets my expectations.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Comes with many different heads for different cleaning purposes.</li>
    <li> Works great! I would recommend this product. You can save dentist visit by using regularly.</li>
    <li> This is great- I had no idea that water flossers existed until recently and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase. This product is definitely worth purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1.) Regular flossing takes so much more time and this machine saves at least 2 minutes everyday compared to regular flossing, or about 12 hours a year.&lt;br /&gt;2.) I feel water flossing gets between the gums much better than normal flossing&lt;br /&gt;3.) Think about how much money you save on dental bills. Most people don&#x27;t floss normally because its a pain in the ass, but this makes the process so much easier, which helps keep your gums healthy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1.) Works well near the gum-line but harder to use between teeth if you have tight spaces, especially around the molars.&lt;br /&gt;2.) kind of loud, can be heard through the wall if someone is sleeping&lt;br /&gt;3.) somewhat messy in the beginning (water splashes until you get used to moving it around)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: Worth the ~50 bucks, especially if you&#x27;re lazy like me and would not otherwise get around to daily flossing the normal way</li>
    <li> Item arrived in France, but didn&#x27;t work at all. Return to the USA...</li>
    <li> Good quality. Sleek design!</li>
    <li> The device works great but my one complaint is that it is pretty loud. I purchased a water pik at the recommendation of my dentist. I had just had a procedure to resolve some gum disease. After 2 months of using the water pik I went in for a follow up and my dentist bounced around the room after she saw the improvement in the health of my gums. We both attribute the exceptional results to my daily use of the water pik. I have only had experience with this model so can&#x27;t say this is the best model but it works for me.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this.  I use the water pick twice a day, and this one doesn&#x27;t disappoint. It takes less space than my old model, and the reservoir is a perfect, single use size, so you can always have fresh water, warm water in it.  I also love the upgrade to the button on the handle. Instead of a push in design this has a slide feature.  The push in one would always get stuck and I would have to turn off the machine and futz with it to get it unstuck. So far this is a much better unit!</li>
    <li> Great product, great price. Small and light but just as strong and durable thanks to a more efficient DC motor, according to WP.</li>
    <li> I like it.I hope I can insist on using it.</li>
    <li> We love our new waterpik. cleans between the teeth and the gum line. Should have bought one a long time ago.</li>
    <li> Closer to 3 1/2 stars. I love the way it cleans, that&#x27;s no problem. But previous models had storage for several tips, this one only has room for 2. Also, to turn it on you have to slide a switch. They used to have a button which was much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nit picky, yes but I have no idea why they made these changes.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price; several tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;30 second switch/timer &#x3D; easy to know how much time was spent on each area of the mouth.</li>
    <li> This is soooooooooooo much better than actually flossing... plus you can use it like a water gun and shoot your significant other!</li>
    <li> I just got the waterpik. Followed the instructions for pre-use, which is filling with water and running it at high speed. I left the bathroom for severalinutes and came back to it completely empty of water. The water drained out somehow inside the machine. Hope this is only a one time thing!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. My teeth feel so clean.</li>
    <li> Got a good price on daily deal for this product.  Works well for those hard to reach places!</li>
    <li> Purchased this based on dentist recommendation. I was surprised to see there were so many stuff that I did not clean out with regular brush and floss. Make sure you turn the power around 6 when first start using so you would not hurt your gum, I had couple bloody and painful experience to realize that.&lt;br /&gt;Will update again and see if this machine improves my gum health in couple month.</li>
    <li> Good quality build, doesn&#x27;t have Apple&#x27;s ridiculously fastidious attention to user experience, but for something I use twice a day for a few minutes, I am happy with it. It&#x27;s like the Sony Walkman was before the iPod. Compared to any other water flosser, it&#x27;s the best, but someday someone will pay attention to designing a better one eventually, even though it&#x27;s not a product class anyone would ever feel passionate about.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik arrived sooner than expected.  I like the overall size and was surprised to find included three color coded nozzles.  The reservoir is ample enough to complete a single session.  I would have wanted to get more pressure from the system; but on the highest level, it just meets my ideal setting.  If the pressure would be increased significantly, this rating would be a 5-plus.</li>
    <li> I thought it would have more power than it does. Disappointed :-( .</li>
    <li> Great product I use if daily!!!! I just got braces helps 1000% getting food and left overs out for cleaning</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Using it everyday! :D</li>
    <li> Great tool for dental hygiene. Stay away from mirrors while operating lol a few splashes with the first few uses</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I suck at flossing and always have.  Over the last 5+ years I have made a significant extra effort to floss more but am still lectures by my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve known about these for some years but I thought they cost a lot more (maybe they did).&lt;br /&gt;I read the directions and did the setting on the highest setting andused it as a pressure washer for some spots in my &amp;#34;man&amp;#34; bathroom that does need a good deep cleaning.  However, I refilled the reservoir and quickly started using this.  The first thing I&#x27;ll admit is this does take some practice so prepare to get water all over your face and/or mirror, etc. however, it&#x27;s just water and I can honestly say I have never had my teeth flossed this well before in my life unless a dentist or hygienist did it for me at the dentist office.  I expect a lot different comments the next time I see the dentist.</li>
    <li> Like so many other reviewers here have found, on my unit the ON/OFF switch on the handle is extremely stiff and almost impossible to use. I actually bent my nail just trying to get the damn thing to turn off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The timer feature is annoying. It can be disabled using a special combination of button presses but the device doesn&#x27;t remember the setting if you unplug it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tip storage is in an annoying location and only holds two tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a complete fail.</li>
    <li> The on off handle slide switch is hard to move from off to on positions or visa versa . Otherwise ,it is an excellent dental cleaning device. A rocker switch would be a significant improvement.</li>
    <li> made the wife happy, that makes me the King</li>
    <li> love love love this is the best waterpik ever. This is my 4th waterpik.and the best..</li>
    <li> Bought this as a replacement for our old model. Works like a charm! Great!!</li>
    <li> Excellent and very effective and easy to use</li>
    <li> It broke after 10 months. called customer service, totally helpless! Never buy this brand product again!</li>
    <li> Waterpik does the trick</li>
    <li> The highest spray seeing is still not as strong add I&#x27;d expect but it&#x27;s effective for the price.</li>
    <li> Love this.....just keep the line clean from  bacteria buildup( my dentist told me that )</li>
    <li> Slide switch to turn on water is extremely difficult to use. Sticks in the closed position, so I literally have to pry on it to open and start water flow. Odd because the device otherwise seems well made. Perhaps mine is an anomaly. I would give it five stars if this switch worked better.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe what I&#x27;ve been missing all this time.</li>
    <li> I bought this in the local pharmacy and I just use it. After using this I just feel really clean and fresh. And also I think I saw a little piece tartar when I wash my teeth. I will use it every day and hope my teeth will healthier than before!</li>
    <li> Does very good job cleaning...more convenience than flossing.&lt;br /&gt;The only minor problem is that the water switch in the handle is sticky and hard to switch, but it works well.</li>
    <li> Excellent product from a first class company.  I expected no less.  The product is ergonomically designed, easy to use and very efficient at deep cleaning teeth and gums. I highly recommend the WP-660.</li>
    <li> I have a bias against this tool, because it is a baldface ripoff of my grandfather&#x27;s invention of the oral irrigator.  Dr. C.D. Matteson conceived, invented, patented and produced by hand the original prototype in 1953 in Ft Collins, CO.  When I lived as a child in Arlington, VA, he came to visit and spent most of the visit getting the patent done.  In 1955-56, when I lived in Ft Collins, my brother and I demonstrated the oral irrigator for his colleagues.  On of his &amp;#34;friends&amp;#34; was Mr. Mattingly.  He was impressed with it and wanted to partner up with my grandfather to manufacture it.  That did not go well.  My grandfather&#x27;s invention was directly screwed on the faucet, had no motor of any type nor electricity and provided a continuous 90 lbs of pressure flow.  The valve had the ability to direct the flow to the syringe or directly from the faucet by use of a turnable knob.  Mattingly did some work arounds to add a motorized pump and a pulsating flow, neither of which is desirable.  So, by purchasing this fraud, I feel as though I am a traitor to my grandfather&#x27;s vision, but my valve that he invented does not fit on my faucet, so I purchased this instead.  It is better than nothing.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it, she uses it every single day.</li>
    <li> I really like the different speeds and for the price I thought it was a good deal.  I also like how it come with majority of the tools (7 in all) to help clean my gums and bridge.  I still use a regular floss but the water helps sooth my gums when needed.</li>
    <li> I disagree with prior posters who thought the quality was decreased. This is by far the best Waterpik I have used and I have been using them for 16 years. The set up is improved. The stopper has been redesigned and that was always a problem on the older models that used a black rubber stopper that would begin to leak after a year or so.&lt;br /&gt;I (and my dentist) credit this product for saving my teeth. I had diseased gums when it was first recommended, now my gums never bleed, even when getting a cleaning at the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only product that removes germs below the gum line. I recommend this product highly.&lt;br /&gt;Let me add if I only brush my teeth, I still feel like my teeth are dirty.  I also use this product as a \\&quot;tooth pic\\&quot; when I get something stuck between my teeth.  If you have never used a Waterpik, get one; use it for at least two weeks (it takes some getting use to) and you will always need one in your bathroom.</li>
    <li> An original product from a reliable seller!</li>
    <li> works as expected. takes practice.</li>
    <li> BEST price out there.  Came Very quick with regular delivery.</li>
    <li> It has been a great water flosser.  The last couple of times that I went the  the dentist they commented about how little plack there&lt;br /&gt;was on my teeth.</li>
    <li> Bought this on recommendation by my Dentist. Since I have been using this, my gums have returned to good condition.</li>
    <li> Got it quick and it works awsome</li>
    <li> I cannot understand if the difficulty is using this product is because of the product or user error. Despite reading the directions thoroughly and piddling around with it for a while, I just cannot control the stream in a way that doesn&#x27;t make the water come out like a firehose in my mouth. I think this is a great concept but it has already become a tool that I&#x27;ve thrown in my closet and probably will not use again (though I will consider it many times)</li>
    <li> Works great. Is a tad bit noisy, makes a motor rumbling noise when power button is pushed.  It would be nice if it came with a case for all the picks and brushes. There is only a spot to hold two inside of the water area, the other five go in a zip lock bag for me. Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Very good, helpful product! Well worth the money!!</li>
    <li> This Waterpik works great, we are very happy with how easy it is to use, once you figure out how to control the water from splashing all over. I had tendency to keep my mouth closed instead of letting the water flow out, but soon figured it out and it is all in controlling the water with your lips.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this water flosser.  I think it does a good job.</li>
    <li> Well worth the money!  I recently just got braces that are placed behind the teeth (lingual braces).  They are a bit more challenging to keep keep and the Waterpik is ideal for getting all the spots that my toothbrush may miss, regardless of how well I brush!  I wasn&#x27;t keen on the idea at first, but, now it&#x27;s a must! I use mine twice a day! Love it!</li>
    <li> Great! Like power-washing your mouth. With a bit of added hydrogen peroxide or mouthwash to the solution it makes for an even fresher cleaner sensation.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this item.</li>
    <li> Wow, we love this Waterpik.  I wish we had purchased it earlier.  It has made a huge impact on the oral hygiene of my family.  It is a lifesaver for the daughter in braces. It cleans so well under the wire and around the brackets and along her gum line.  I would be happy if that was the extent of the improvement but it made a huge difference in my mouth as well.  I bought it primarily for my use because I had some pockets along my gums.  After 6 weeks of use they were all reduced to 1-2 mm from 4-5.  It feels really good to use.  We always add a splash of mouthwash to the warm water in the reservoir.  I have had trouble with leaks.</li>
    <li> I had the older version before and I have to say this model takes smaller place than the other one. Design is neat and there is a new function called massage. However, I prefer the on/off button of the older version in the handle. This button is too tight and slipery especially when the handle is wet. Otherwise it is a good model for daily use.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this product. The button on the wand is very hard to push &amp;#34;ON&amp;#34; and it uses a lot of water and is very noisy. I have to push the &amp;#34;ON&amp;#34; button before I turn on the machine in order to get it to work.</li>
    <li> works much better than my older model waterpik, easy to use and no leaks.</li>
    <li> I have replaced a 5 year old Ultra unit. The old one still worked, even though it had a minor issue. I find this unit to clean more effectively than the old one. I love it! They have improved the design tremendously.</li>
    <li> Best water pic I&#x27;ve ever had, Adjustable setting are great. extra tips. And you can buy more tips my last one I couldn&#x27;t find them Gums feel great and I would recommend this to everybody.</li>
    <li> They improved on perfection.  Had the previous model for 2 1/2 years before it started to die.  I use these on a &amp;#34;10&amp;#34; and that setting on this model is really strong - about a 15 to 20% improvement over the previous.  A little tricky to get the filled bowl to seat with spillage - helps if you hook your thumb over the edge and use your pointing finger as balance on the indent - that way you can slip it into place without too much mess.</li>
    <li> Cleanest braces in 50 states! Love the attachments for braces and everything. Water resevoire lifts out to dry and disinfect.</li>
    <li> I am please with this waterpik.  It&#x27;s the first one I have ever owned and works well.  Only gave it 4 stars because the on/off switch is difficult for me to slide due to my age and weak hands.</li>
    <li> almost perfect， but some noise when running</li>
    <li> I like the adjustable pressure feature. I use it twice a day and have solved the problem I had with flossing some tough spots.</li>
    <li> I like this and it is great that you can adjust the pressure that you use.  I was surprised at how much junk was left in my teeth after brushing. I lean over the sink when using so I don&#x27;t splash the mirror.  If I had to say something critical about it I would have to say the on off button that&#x27;s on the handle is hard to slide on and off.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t floss any other way. Great product that I didn&#x27;t know I needed until I tried it... won&#x27;t go back.</li>
    <li> on and off switch on handle is difficult to move</li>
    <li> Amazingly efficient at cleaning between teeth, gums, etc. - in fact I think every home in America should have one of these! I have had gingivitis for years and this has already improved my gums tremendously (after only ~2 weeks) and I have tried everything! My new oral hygienist recommended.</li>
    <li> great product, highly recommend</li>
    <li> Very effective. I like the smaller size. The price on Amazon  was  good.</li>
    <li> I love my Waterpik.  This is so much better for me than using string floss.  It is a tad loud (in my opinion) but that does not affect its functionality.  I&#x27;ve been using it daily for a couple of months now and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Works great for kids with braces, now if you can get them to use it and brush twice a day!</li>
    <li> Too loud and the water gets low right away.</li>
    <li> ASTONISHING (to me, anyway) HEALTH UPDATE (2/19/2017): WATERPIKING SAVES LIVES, MAYBE YOURS! REALLY! I MEAN IT! (I know, it sounds crazy...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally broke down and got a Waterpik when my dentist told me I had periodontal pockets and would need a deep cleaning. I read somewhere that with regular use of a Waterpik, I might just be able to reverse those pockets and eliminate that need for an uncomfortable deep cleaning. I gave it a three-month try and it worked! No deep cleaning needed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I spoke with my primary care physician about plaque, and learned that there are two more (one of them could save your life) benefits to Waterpiking regularly. See my UPDATE at the end of this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that others have asked a lot of the questions that I had early on inside of their reviews and in the customer questions section. So I thought I would gather up all of the answers and put them in one review. I hope this will be your Guide to Using Your New Aquarius Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do find this review helpful, please click &amp;#34;Yes&amp;#34; below, I&#x27;d appreciate it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW DO I AVOID MAKING MY GUMS BLEED WHEN I START USING MY WATERPIK?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not in the instructions anymore, but according to my husband, Waterpik used always to tell users to start by using the lowest &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; pressure setting and then to turn the pressure up one notch per day to get your gums adjusted to the Waterpik&#x27;s pressure gradually. If you do this, you should be on &amp;#34;10&amp;#34;, or whatever setting you prefer, in no time and with no gum bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW DO I KEEP FROM SPLASHING WATER EVERYWHERE?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two simple tricks never to see a water splash again. First, don&#x27;t turn the Waterpik on until it is in your mouth. Second, keep your mouth closed except a slight parting of your lips to allow water to drain out of your mouth, while you use your Waterpik. That should take care of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE ON/OFF SWITCH ON THE HANDLE IS HARD TO USE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will, unfortunately, just have to get the hang of how to master that switch. It seems to be a matter to where you apply pressure on the switch. It seems to work best when you apply pressure close to the center, rather than from the bottom or the top, in my limited experience. However, in the meantime, if you get frustrated, just use the on/off button on the face of the machine as a shortcut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHY DO THEY SEND SEVEN TIPS BUT ONLY PROVIDE SLOTS FOR TWO?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, you only receive four different types of tips. The total number of tips adds up to seven because Waterpik provides three identical Classic Jet Tips (see below for descriptions of each). Most people choose only one style of tip for daily use (possibly two if you have periodontal pockets).

(For people with that sort of dental work, use the &amp;#34;Plaque Seeker Tip&amp;#34;, described below.) Use the Classic Jet Tip unless you have a special reason to choose one of the others.&lt;br /&gt;Rather than include links to the replacement tips in this review, I recommend that you just do a search for &amp;#34;Waterpik JT-100E&amp;#34;. That way, there&#x27;s no risk that this review will be filled with dead links.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you search by the tip&#x27;s name, you will probably get results that include tips that are not compatible with your Aquarius. So I have provided the actual model numbers of each tip so that you can search for the right one. If any tip that you want is not available on Amazon, you can buy it directly from Waterpik dot com. (Note For Ultra Buyers: the Ultra uses the same modeltips as the Aquarius, provided here.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;TOOTHBRUSH TIP&amp;#34; (quantity: 1, but that is plenty for most)&lt;br /&gt;To identify it: it looks like a tiny toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;This tip allows you to brush your teeth and Waterpik at the same time. As efficient as that sounds, there must be a reason why they included 3 Classic Jet Tips and only 1 Toothbrush Tip. I am guessing the reason is that this Brush Tip looks more efficient than it is -- especially if you have an effective toothbrush like a Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;Search for &amp;#34;Waterpik TB-100E&amp;#34; to find compatible replacement tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;PLAQUE SEEKER TIP&amp;#34; (quantity: 1) (my daily use tip)&lt;br /&gt;To identify it: look for fewer bristles than are on the Toothbrush Tip.&lt;br /&gt;The Plaque Seeker Tip is designed for use with crown, implants, and bridges, as well as for general use. So if you have any dental work more serious than fillings in your mouth (i.e. are you over 30?), you can just use this tip as your daily tip all around your mouth. &amp;#34;Removes bacteria and debris from hard to reach areas around dental restorations.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Search for &amp;#34;Waterpik PS-100E&amp;#34; to buy refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;PIK POCKET TIP&amp;#34; (quantity: 1)&lt;br /&gt;To identify it: it looks like the Classic Jet Tip but with an extra pointy attachment at the end.&lt;br /&gt;This one is for people who have periodontal pockets or furcations. It can &amp;#34;deliver medicaments&amp;#34; except that neither the Aquarius nor the Ultra is designed for that (they don&#x27;t have &amp;#34;Medicament Reservoirs&amp;#34;), or just rinse deep below the gumline. Few people will choose to use the Pik Pocket as their daily tip. You would use this before or after you do your primary Waterpik rinse, and probably just on the areas that need it. This tip is supposed to be used only with the machine set to a pressure of &amp;#34;1&amp;#34;, so don&#x27;t forget to turn the pressure down before using it.&lt;br /&gt;Search for &amp;#34;PP-100E&amp;#34; to get compatible replacement tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OTHER WATERPIK TIPS YOU CAN BUY ON AMAZON COMPATIBLE WITH THE WATERPIK AQUARIUS: these don&#x27;t come with your Aquarius but they are compatible with it, and you may find them useful:&lt;br /&gt;--Orthodontic tip OD-100E&lt;br /&gt;--Tongue Cleaner TC-100E&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, Waterpik also offers a storage case that comes with six compatible tips.

So, she suggested using one per tooth but on a less frequent basis, and using the Waterpik two times, full time, every single day instead.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this! I always hated flossing, especially when the string would cut my gums. After using this Waterpik, my mouth feels and tastes SO clean! I add a few drops of mouthwash (AFTER filling or you get a bunch of foam), which adds to the fresh feeling. Warning - Keep extra towels around to clean the area around your sink and mirror until you get used to controlling the water, LOL! Just keep your head down toward the sink and you&#x27;ll be fine. And I love seeing everything wash away down the drain instead of falling off the floss, or worse when it goes flying in the air to land somewhere unknown! I find I will use this at least every other day if not every day, which was rarely the case when I used to use &#x27;string&#x27;.</li>
    <li> excellent product end good price</li>
    <li> This is a awesome machine.  I spent a lot of time comparing products and this is the one to buy</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several months with no problems.  It works great.</li>
    <li> As a Chinese, it&#x27;s awkward to buy something from American then find out it is &amp;#34;Made in China&amp;#34;. And it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
    <li> Been using this for about three weeks and my gums are so much more healthy and a great color.</li>
    <li> Love this product.......use it day lee.......!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised and nicely unobtrusive / small on the counter top.  Nice design.</li>
    <li> Second water pick for second child with braces.  What can I say there is no others on the market that function as well as this.  Invaluable tool for daily use to remove everything that gets into braces.  Works without fail.  I went back to this model since my sons (first child&#x27;s) experience with his.  It works without fail after 3 years of daily use and braces.</li>
    <li> Better than the other water piks that I have purchased.  The on/off switch in not easy to operate.</li>
    <li> I love my waterpik!! It&#x27;s very continent and does the job perfectly. I just wish they had created a different on and off button.</li>
    <li> Works great, I love the way it cleans my teeth.</li>
    <li> I love the adjustable pressure and the removable water reservoir.  Had gotten a handheld waterpik from my dentist office, but it only had 2 pressure levels and the water tank only allowed for about 30 seconds of flossing.  This one, if used on low pressure, will go for about a minute giving you plenty of time to get all areas.  It&#x27;s easier to wield the smaller wand too.  I like this one much better.  My gums feel healthier and mouth feels cleaner.</li>
    <li> I use this twice a day and my teeth feel much cleaner.</li>
    <li> My dentist told me to get one of these Waterpiks, or it was gum surgery time.  This Waterpik Aquarius Water Flosser does a good job of cleaning down in those pockets between my teeth, and it&#x27;s quite easy to use--except I haven&#x27;t quite figured out what all of those extra, oddly shaped heads are for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one problem with this model:  the ON/OFF switch on the handle is extremely hard to switch back and forth.  I almost gave up and returned the Waterpik to the manufacturer.  I finally was able to switch it on, and I&#x27;m going to leave it that way.  I&#x27;ll turn the machine on and off using the power button on the main body.</li>
    <li> My hygienist recommended this to me.  It&#x27;s wonderful.  Easy.  Your teeth feel professionally cleaned after using.  Hopefully my next check up will show improved gum growth rather than loss!  Do it in place of flossing.</li>
    <li> mine is going back.  Cheaply made and it leaks</li>
    <li> I purchased the Waterflosser Ultra from Target and I absolutely love it! I am 26 years old with braces and struggle with using string floss with them. Though string floss can be effective, it is hard to get closer to the back of my mouth, as I still have my wisdom teeth. This has helped with oral hygiene SO much, especially around my braces! I can literally feel the difference with my tongue using this product. Will keep you posted after my first check up after using this product twice a day :)</li>
    <li> So far this has been getting a lot of use.  It cleans exactly as I hoped it would.  I get a little messy with it sometime as I have it turned up to &amp;#34;9&amp;#34;; it moves a lot of water at that speed.  It has the same 30 second bump timer as my sonicare so it fits right in.</li>
    <li> The best water flosser I ever had</li>
    <li> Waterpik, you my only friend</li>
    <li> Works great! Just as expected.</li>
    <li> First, I should say the voltage is 110V, so if you want use it in China, you should buy additional transformer; Second, you should use the luckwarm water in winter that&#x27;s a litter bit inconvenience in China since most of home are not serve 24 hours hot water. But I should say it make me more comfortable once you clean up your tooth, I will suggest buy this for the oral care purpose.&lt;br /&gt;首先，这个洗牙器的电压是110伏的，如果要在中国使用，必须购买一个变压器（公牛100人民币左右），另外电压插头是美国标准插头，一个大一个小的那种插头，普通变压器不能插，还得买一个转换头，可以去淘宝上买一个公牛的（21人民币）；其次，洗牙器建议用温水，冬天使用的时候确实比较需要，夏天我觉得冷水也无所谓。使用的体验还是不错，每次吃饭结束以后用洗牙器洗一下，感觉比漱口要干净和清爽很多，还是推荐购买的。</li>
    <li> Great device for cleaning under bridges . My grandchildren rush in and use the pik to clean around their braces. Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Never had a water pik before &amp; now don&#x27;t want to use anything else.</li>
    <li> Nice and compact design. Powerful water pressure. Easy to use. Only con: it&#x27;s a bit noisy when it&#x27;s running.</li>
    <li> Shory cord makes it difficult to use. Returned</li>
    <li> Terrific product! I don&#x60;t know how I lived without it. Here is what I do: 1. Floss. 2. Brush. 3. Use this thing. Voila. Wake up in the morning with fresh breath.</li>
    <li> unfortunately it cannot replace the regular dental floss cord</li>
    <li> Product meets my expectations.</li>
    <li> My first waterpik since I had braces back in high school. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only comment is to be careful not to shoot yourself under the tongue or any other sensitive areas. On level 8, the water stream cut me under my tongue and it was sore for days. This was my own fault though, I am more careful now and love how clean my mouth feels.</li>
    <li> Small footprint; doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space on a bathroom countertop.  Although not cordless, when not in use, the cord is easily wound back into its compartment.  I&#x27;m a long-time water-flosser.  After purchasing this specific appliance for my husband, he had no choice but to use it!  I convinced him to get into the habit of irrigating at least every evening just before bedtime. I&#x27;m still amazed at how much debris regular flossing with tape or slippery waxed dental floss does not remove what only a water flosser does. But getting into the habit of using regular dental floss, then brushing as usual, and finishing this 3-step process with water-flossing is the best long-term way of preventing cavities, tooth loss, and especially bad breath!</li>
    <li> Very well made and easy to use.  Only complaint is the tank is a bit small for my use.  I have to rush to get it done before it runs out.  I know I can refill but gosh!</li>
    <li> I had an older model of this item and I like this one even better.</li>
    <li> I could use one of these for probably 25 years. Wow have they made improvements the fact that the Water line coils and self stores is one of the biggest improvement. So much easier than flossing.</li>
    <li> Works great! It&#x27;s like a water park in your mouth! Put a little mouthwash or peroxide in the water fora super fresh feeling!  Love it! Didn&#x27;t need all those fancy heads tho,  just the basic one is fine.</li>
    <li> it leaks and doesnt even turn on, you will waste your money.</li>
    <li> Great waterpik. I have braces so it helps alot!</li>
    <li> The on/off switch is very hard to use.  Otherwise, if you don&#x27;t turn on too high, it&#x27;s just fine.</li>
    <li> great product...fast shipping</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this waterpik!</li>
    <li> Love it.  I only wish that the water reservoir was bigger.  I would definitely recommend to anyone who is looking for a waterpik.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but let me tell ya, this thing will rip yer gums out if you aren&#x27;t used to it! (That&#x27;s a compliment). Very efficient and effective. My main advice is 1) Don&#x27;t try using it with your mouth open. You&#x27;ll Jackson Pollack your entire bathroom with water, and (2) Don&#x27;t crank this baby up to the 10 setting until you are used to it. I made that mistake. Water can hurt. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit noisy, so if you are using it when others are sleeping or in a room close by, close the door. You&#x27;ll irritate them (speaking from experience, here.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, if this one dies, I would definitely purchase another.</li>
    <li> I like the Waterpik, it is a little hard for me to push the button up to on position but I did injure my wrist recently</li>
    <li> I do basic flossing but I think it works well. It is noisy but that does not bother me at all. I still prefer flossing as primary and waterpik for secondary when I am extremely lazy.</li>
    <li> Few months back I bought a Waterpik Cordless Water Flosser from Singapore National Dental Center shop. But it broke down shortly (power switch did not work). So I decided to order a better version from Amazon US.  Today I received my Waterpik Aquarius Water Flosser (WP-660). It wouldn&#x27;t start! Power switch doesn&#x27;t work! Same problem in completely different Waterpik products I bought from 2 separate jurisdictions! I am returning the item.  I doubt I will ever buy a waterpik product. Luckily Panasonic Water Flossser EW-DJ10-A I ordered at the same time works perfectly well.</li>
    <li> works great. arrived ahead of schedule.</li>
    <li> Use it every day, quite handy</li>
    <li> Much better than the older models.</li>
    <li> Love this Water Pik. It&#x27;s helping to save my teeth.</li>
    <li> Saving my life every night, such a good purchase.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik even does a great job on bridges. It is an excellent tool for your teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> This appliance functions well, is conveniently and attractively designed, comes with full instructions/help for use, and is a joy to use. Yes, perhaps this model is not as heavy as an earlier one, but it is quite heavy enough that unwanted movement or shimmying from the motor is not a problem. The self-coiling mini water hose avoids unwanted tangling and stores neatly in a small niche. I just had a stellar report from my dentist, so I&#x27;m very pleased. The Water Flosser does the trick and does it well.</li>
    <li> i bought this and an electric toothbrush after a long overdue visit to the dentist showed i have advanced periodontal disease. i have never been a flosser (lazy). this product is so great. the periodontal tip works brilliantly. i can see it working with the food particles that it dislodges. takes a little getting used to but after the first time of spraying it all over the mirror now I am a pro at it. my wife uses this too and having all those different tips included really helps. love the neat little storage compartment that holds the two tips. some online articles say it not as great as regular flossing but hey its at least getting me to floss. its easy to use so i dont feel as lazy as i used to about using a flosser.</li>
    <li> Strong water flow.  Easy to turn on and off.  Vastly superior to earlier version that stopped working after 3 months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with WaterPik these days.  The product works fine at first, but the last TWO units I&#x27;ve bought have had issues within a couple of months.  The first had a motor issue that made the pulse of the water erratic;  the second would not lock the nozzle to the wand - it keeps squirting off.  Sad.  I&#x27;m not sure where to turn next.  I need this appliance.  BTW, I had a much older unit before these two - used it for many years!  No problems until I flat wore it out...</li>
    <li> Functionally works great, but pump is quite loud.</li>
    <li> The lid sticks when you open &amp; close it. Otherwise works great!!</li>
    <li> Works just as advertised.</li>
    <li> Really effective tool.  Had a promising check up because of the Water Pik.  Messy but worth it!</li>
    <li> Works great but it is a little louder than I anticipated. All in all I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> Dentist clean all the time!</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t work at all</li>
    <li> Gum disease is one of the leading causes of other body diseases an doctors and dentists have continued to stress the importance of flossing. I hate using regular string floss and have previously used the Waterpik Ultra model. I love this new model from Waterpik, I love the size, the set up, the quietness and the modern appearance it has sitting on my bathroom vanity. It flosses amazing and when I first used it I found a lot of bleeding with my gums, but now having used it for almost two weeks now daily, my gums are not bleeding. And my mouth feels incredibly clean and fresh. I highly recommend this flosser to anyone who hates the drudgery of flossing. Waterpik actually makes a mundane, but critical, task fun and attractive. Kudos!!!</li>
    <li> Waterpik works, however, the handle switch is difficult to turn on and off.</li>
    <li> No more gingivitis because of this Waterpik!  Everyone should get one and the price is great!</li>
    <li> First time I&#x27;ve ever used a product like this, and after the first time I wondered why it took me so long to get started. I&#x27;ve never been a daily floss orf always seem to get a little correction from the dental assistant when I go in for check up for work. After using the WaterPik for several weeks now I found that I floss with it every day and sometimes twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is so amazing to me is how easily the WaterPik gets the small, sometimes larger than you might want to admit, pieces from between your teeth. Pieces of grizzle, celery string, and many other foodstuffs are easily removed by the pressure of the water coming from the system. The overall quality of my teeth has improved just from using this product. Of course, this is no substitute for use of a brush quality toothpaste. It is a great way to supplement those tools and I found an easy substitute for regular floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I didn&#x27;t think I would use it and found it very satisfying is the massage option for the WaterPik. I use it a couple times a week on gums and tongue and find it oddly satisfying. I would strongly recommend this product for anyone that is a part-time flosser, and even those dedicated to the stringer tape would likely find this product of great benefit.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping &amp; great product!</li>
    <li> excellent product,kepp your gums healthy.</li>
    <li> This product is great.  As I get up in my years, food finds it easier to stick between my teeth.  I buy these plastic tooth picks but they only work so well.  Brushing helps but I still get left with food between my teeth.  I just got three new implants to add to the two I already had and a bunch of capped teeth.  My dentist recommended I get a water pick.  I looked at a number of them and read the reviews.  On the cheaper picks, the authors, even if the like the pick, they liked the Waterpik better.  So I spent the few extra bucks and I extremely happy.  It&#x27;s got so that I try to use the Waterpik after every meal.  Get this one, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I can&#x27;t stop using it! Makes my mouth feel really clean. My gums feel nice too. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I am real satisfied with my Waterpik Aquarius Water Flosser.  It does a great job.</li>
    <li> little loud but works well</li>
    <li> Bells and whistles, does a fine job but...the water feeder tube is awkward and the handle On/Off switch is sticky.</li>
    <li> Arrived as promised. It is easy, quick and effective! I&#x27;ll never go back to flossing with string.</li>
    <li> Like the many attachments with it. Great water pik!!!</li>
    <li> The motor is ...noisy. It rattles a lot and dripping around the handle.</li>
    <li> just what I expected and nice to get it  shipped to my door.</li>
    <li> Can be very powerful. And gets all the bad stuff out. However, the turn on push knob on the actual nossle is sometimes impossible to push into the on and off positions.</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift to my brother who needed one.  He tells me that works like a wonder and cleans as his dentist ordered.</li>
    <li> Hello, i received my waterpik that i bought here today but it stopped working after 10 seconds, the water basket was still half full, i tryd using it again after 30 minutes but nothing works anymore. Who do i contact for this problem?</li>
    <li> Cleans you&#x27;re teeth squeaky clean. I can&#x27;t go higher than medium power, it then becomes to strong, you gotta work your way up to full power.</li>
    <li> The on-off switch on the handle that holds the pik will not slide from off to on or vice versa.  I had to use the switch on the main body of the WaterPik, which is not convenient.  One shouldn&#x27;t have to figure out a work-around on a brand new item.  I sent back because it was too inconvenient to not have a unctioning switch.  I previously had a HydroFloss for several years before it finally died; it was a much more reliable and functional product, but it did take up more counter space.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Just what I expected.</li>
    <li> I have had a waterpik for years.  This newer model has so many more cleaning tools, and really makes my teeth feel clean.</li>
    <li> I have permanent retainers which makes it difficult to use regular floss so, as gross as it is, I had not been flossing since I&#x27;ve had them. This waterpik is great. My dentist recommended it and it has been incredible. The first day, I flossed five times. If you&#x27;re on the fence, buy it.</li>
    <li> good,it has strong water par</li>
    <li> The water pik works great. I put some mouth wash in with the water and it rinses out my mouth so well! I use it daily.</li>
    <li> I have now been using this for several months and have been very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High quality!&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen a great improvement in my gum health since beginning use!</li>
    <li> This Waterpik Aquarius is exactly what I was hoping for, an easy way to supplement flossing everyday. Cons: it&#x27;s a rather large machine that must sit near the sink and an outlet. Not exactly pretty decor for the bathroom. What it was more inconspicuous.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it works great. Has an adjustable dial that lets you choose the pressure. I have it set on the highest and its a very effective tool for cleaning teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended a Waterpik and this one works just fine. It is my first experience with one so I don&#x27;t have a comparison.</li>
    <li> My dentist highly recommended I get a water flosser to help with my gum issues so I picked one of these up. It takes some getting used to, but my teeth seem much cleaner since I&#x27;ve started using this. I used to get plaque build-up on my lower teeth were my night-time guard sits, but I have not gotten any since I&#x27;ve started using this.</li>
    <li> No complaints except water will run down your arm unless you adjust</li>
    <li> Works great and my dentist noticed the difference once I started using it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just my problem . This product has a loud noise.</li>
    <li> Mouth feels fresher than ever, a real clean feel.</li>
    <li> Works great- comes with many handles and different nozzles. My husband and I use it daily.</li>
    <li> I have to give this model WP-660 a good rating for actual performance but that&#x27;s where it stops. I debated on which model to purchase because I wanted a good cleaning unit for my teeth because even though they look good in a smile I&#x27;ve lost some back teeth in the past years mainly due to the fact I am a smoker. (Yes, I know very stupid)  The model WP-100 would have a good choice too but I thought this model had to be the best. This model WP-660 seems cheaply made in reality. Nothing about it seems sturdy and well made. Very light and seems like the hose leaked at the bottom of the handle when I first used it but second try it didn&#x27;t so now I&#x27;m worried it will leak again.  And why in the world fir this insane price wouldn&#x27;t they include holders for the tip heads? I guess they hope you loose them or break them.  My advise is to purchase the WP-100.  You will save money and basically get the same results and perhaps a better made unit. You can always buy the extra types of tip heads which I believe are interchangable.  I&#x27;ve used it 3 times and yes, it does seem to remove small particles of food and whatever gets trapped in between teeth. Then again had a similar product back in the 1970s that did the same thing and was built much better. I guess quality has dropped through the years as the price increases. The exact model on the box shows WP-660C.  Not sure if this is exactly the model shown since it does seem to look like it and have the 7 attachments.  (There was no letter C in the advertised model)&lt;br /&gt;This model seriously could have been easily a $30 device.  Upset I payed what I did but needed it. Take some advise and get the WP-100 and save your money.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.......I have some dental implants and it really helps with cleaning.</li>
    <li> Good item, does a very good job. Never had a water flosser before, but this machine does a great job.</li>
    <li> WATER LEAKS ALL OVER ARMS AND SINKS. DRIP DRIP</li>
    <li> Does a thorough cleaning job. The company&#x27;s instructions could be clearer. RJB</li>
    <li> completely clean the teeth!</li>
    <li> I like the waterpiks pressure. however the on off switch on the handle is alittle hard to push.</li>
    <li> Waterpik Aquarius is more than I expected.  Works well and has good power.  I use with ACT flouride rinse as recommended from my Dentist.  He said that the Waterpik forces the ACT down under the gum line and helps to keep the gums and teeth in good health.  Highly recommended machine.  One of the best water cleaning piks on the market.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm, no issues. Plenty stable on the bathroom sink, hose coils nicely, no leaks. Some weird noises during operation, but they seem to be normal. Off switch on the wand is very stiff, but it does work. Overall a great little product that does the job and doesn&#x27;t eat up a lot of counter space.</li>
    <li> Super.  very easy to use.</li>
    <li> The only issue I have is the switch on the attachment for the water to flow out. Its hard to switch on and off and it makes a mess.</li>
    <li> Great product. This is my first Waterpik so it was a little getting used to. I just think it&#x27;s a little too noisy, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s supposed to be. :)</li>
    <li> So fare I really like it, have not had a check up yet but feel clean after every use. I recommend.  Did a demo on maxxmentum you tube channel https://youtu.be/GdzUCjV_i0M</li>
    <li> Always use  Waterpik and this one does not disappoint.  Does exactly what is advertised.  Use it every day.</li>
    <li> Works great for cleaning under my bridge</li>
    <li> So happy I bought it!  I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Best thing that ever happened to my teeth and gums!</li>
    <li> This Waterpik is fantastic.  It is a little messy to use, but it leaves my teeth feeling like they have been professionally cleaned.  I like it best with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several reviews mention it&#x27;s construction as being inferior to previous models.  Not having had one of those previous models, I cannot compare them, but it&#x27;s construction seems perfectly adequate to me, given its price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it to anyone who hates to floss (as I do).</li>
    <li> Not what I expected.  I had a waterpik a long time ago which worked well for a long time.  When it finally stopped working, I went back to normal dental floss.  Fast forward many years.....So when I saw the Waterpik Aquarius Water Flosser on Amazon, I decided to give it a try.  Bought 2 actually.  One for me, the other as a gift.  The one I sent as a gift, unfortunately, was defective (the on/off switch was stuck) and had to be returned.  The second one - bought for me - works, technically.  Water does shoot out of the nozzle.  As for whether it&#x27;s effective - I would have to say NO.  Water shoots out of the nozzle like it&#x27;s supposed to, but at least 25% of the water and water pressure is lost from the connection joint (where the flossing nozzle connects to the hand held device).  Of course, the higher you set the pressure, the more water comes out (both sides).  This means that the water reservoir isn&#x27;t really big enough to floss well without reloading, which is annoying......And the unit is very loud.</li>
    <li> Works great as expected,use it every might</li>
    <li> Powerful machine, works great</li>
    <li> Cleans very well but you need space to put this.</li>
    <li> Extremely good transnational experience, thanks</li>
    <li> The white blends in better that the blue one I had last time; it also works.  I have not used any attachments with this one or the last one.  The dentist recommends water flossing.  I can see why.  There is so much that this cleans out that brushing does not.  I use it as well to clean razors, toothbrushes and the drain.</li>
    <li> Really enhances my dental cleaning regime. Easy to use and very effective.</li>
    <li> This makes flossing easy.</li>
    <li> it is more tha I thought&lt;br /&gt;I like it</li>
    <li> I bought this back in January (we&#x27;re in June) at the recommendation of my dental hygienist. She&#x27;s been telling me for years to get a waterpik flosser. I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to buy one! Anyway..I&#x27;ve been using this daily in the evening since my last dental cleaning in January and I just returned home from my dental cleaning. I was amazed that for the first time in years I didn&#x27;t spit blood out while rinsing after my cleaning. My hygienist was very happy with out my gums looked and even more pleased at how they showed no signs of sensitivity during the dental cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind if you have sensitive gums you will probably bleed so you might be comforatble with a lower setting and slowly work your way up. It took me a few about two months before I went to the highest setting without bleeding. You would be amazed and grossed at the yucky food particles that this thing gets out that brushing simply can&#x27;t...just that alone will make you want to include the waterpik as part of your daily routine for the rest of your life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the mechanics of this once compared to the older model...I had used both for a week before deciding on the new model just because of appearance, on/off switch on handle and the more compact it is for my sink space....I gave older model to my sister and she loves it. IMO both get the job done which is most important. I also like that I don&#x27;t have to hold down the ON button while flossing, this could be a bit awkward while having to maneuver the pic in various positions while flossing but it&#x27;s manageable. This new model also is lighter weight but I never had it once topple over on my uneven bathroom sink so that&#x27;s not an issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read many other reviews that persuaded me to get the waterpik, hope my review might help someone in return. I am so thrilled and very thankful for this product. I&#x27;d give it 10 stars if I could!! If your on the fence about which model to buy, don&#x27;t be their both equal in performance...if price is an issue you can&#x27;t go wrong with either, whichever is the cheapest go for it! Your gums will be thankful!!</li>
    <li> Used to have a waterpik when I was a child.  This one works great.</li>
    <li> Works just like advertised.</li>
    <li> purchased for my son with braces. works great. he uses it nightly for the flossing. really powerful and well worth the money.</li>
    <li> good product, but a have to get used to it</li>
    <li> It is the best. No need to say.</li>
    <li> Love it. Makes my mouth feel clean after flossing.</li>
    <li> dentist recomended great product</li>
    <li> OMG! I love this. How and why have I lived this long without one?? My mouth feels amazing after using it. Its like pressure washing for your gums and teeth. I&#x27;ll be honest, I was never a good flosser at all. I hated it and never did it. I know I have to, but never did. Now with this, I look forward to it every night.</li>
    <li> definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> I have purchased several portable waterpiks and they all broke within a few months.  Well, this one worked until today - 9 months - and then broke.  I hasn&#x27;t been working right for quite some time.  What&#x27;s the issue with waterpik items that they don&#x27;t last.  Probably won&#x27;t waste my money any more.</li>
    <li> All around, this is great.  The tip assortment that is out there makes this very versatile.  I have tight teeth, and this is a must for me or anyone who might be in braces.  Worth the extra bit versus the less expensive models.</li>
    <li> this water pick, is the best</li>
    <li> Love my water flosser. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months now. Yes, you need to lean over a sink because water will drop from your mouth. The good thing about that is that you&#x27;ll see all the bits and what-not that this thing blasts out of your gums and teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Only issue would be the noise. Hopefully in the future, they&#x27;ll quiet it down a little. Other than that, worth it.</li>
    <li> Compact, works well. I like the on/off switch on the wand. A great improvement from the early days of WaterPik. My dentist recommended the device to remove plaque; it is doing it very very well.</li>
    <li> je suis plainement safisfait...merco</li>
    <li> As much as I feared it, having never used one, I have found it a delight.  I just could floss well enough to please my dentist now my teeth and gums are squeaky clean.  Very easy to use as long as you hang your head over the sink and let the water fly.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This updated Water Flosser is excellent, with a complete choice of attachments. It really does the job! Beyond Floss. Cleaning under a dental bridge is a snap.</li>
    <li> Better than the older model, and we liked that one.</li>
    <li> Really gets the bacteria out!! Makes your mouth feel so clean, much better than flossing! Really enjoy the gum massager, too.</li>
    <li> I like it -- does a good job cleaning out deep pockets and removing today&#x27;s junk, but use it twice daily -- cannot touch anything hardened on.</li>
    <li> Omg I have braces now it&#x27;s hard to take me away from this thing, it is amazing with 7 tips</li>
    <li> Working perfectly for us with daily use.  Don&#x27;t know what more we could ask for...</li>
    <li> this unit works great, it does the job very well.&lt;br /&gt;instructions are very easy to read and to understand.&lt;br /&gt;it does not take up a lot of counter space.&lt;br /&gt;the on/off switch on the handle is very convenient  and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;having it on the handle is much better than units that do not have it there.</li>
    <li> This waterpik works as advertised. I bought it to replace my 22 year old waterpik - my first one lasted a long time. This one has more flexibility, weights less and holds more water. I hope it lasts as long as my first waterpik brand.</li>
    <li> Not very happy with the new Aquarius I purchased.  The noise is a bit better than my old WP-110, but frankly this seems more like a toy than a medical device.  I&#x27;ve had some leaking, but not too bad.  The tube hose has cracked and leaks.  Know I need to irrigate so need to find a better option than Waterpik on my next order.  Really think a device at this price range should last longer than a year.  Disappointed and looking to buy from another company.</li>
    <li> How did I live with out this a must for good dental hygiene!!</li>
    <li> Great Flosser and perfect size for small bathroom, I love this Waterpik</li>
    <li> bought 3 years ago. still works very well.</li>
    <li> I had the Classic Waterpik for several years and recently bought the Waterpik Aquarius Water Flosser - it is so easy to use - I love it!</li>
    <li> is quality and functional as advertised.  I have used the self contained battery operated version and they only last about 6 months.  this one is much more reliable and more functions</li>
    <li> WE COULD NOT START THE WATERPIK AND HAD TO CALL THE COMPANY FOR DIRECTIONS.  VERY POOR DESIGN.</li>
    <li> good item works well,i wish it was wireless</li>
    <li> Works better than the previous model, bigger water tank, however a little noisy</li>
    <li> Nice Waterpik, as advertised.</li>
    <li> Excellent product with more options</li>
    <li> Excellent experience,use it twice a day.it really to clean up your teeth more than brushing.love it.</li>
    <li> So far so good... my problem with these is that they don&#x27;t last long, so we will see... So far good pressure, no leaking, works well.</li>
    <li> Love the massage my gums get from this.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t have enough water pressure and the water holding capacity was WAY to small.</li>
    <li> We had never used a product like this, but my husband and I have found it to be an enhancement to our dental care.  This specific model was actually recommended by our dentist and hygienist, so we did not do much comparison of brands and models.  It is a nice feature to have an On/Off button on the unit as well as on the handle.  I would agree with other users that the water control switch on the handle is somewhat difficult to move - it IS an effort to turn it on while holding it at-the-ready in your mouth.  The inside storage area for two pics could be easier to access when the water reservoir is in place...  After reading all the directions provided, we still found it took a breaking in period to personalize our use and to get the most benefits from the water flosser.  It is now part of our daily routine however and we feel it is a great product.</li>
    <li> Works great.  I LOVE the control over the pressure.</li>
    <li> Mouth feels dirty when I don&#x27;t use it!  I find this much less tedious / messy than using tape floss.  But, you WILL still need to floss for real at least once a week.  It doesn&#x27;t get out everything - but most stuff. :)  Also, if you use a jug / milk container to fill the reservoir, you never need to move the unit, which means less chance for damaging the gaskets w/ the off/on/off/on routine.</li>
    <li> I love this machine. You would have to pry it from my cold dead hands lol.</li>
    <li> See review on Periogen item.</li>
    <li> I love this better than just the Water Pic, better pressure for better cleaning.  I wish there had been a carry bag with it.</li>
    <li> Replaced the old WP-70 (after repairing one part and was about to repair a second) with the WP-660 and I am pleased. It is quieter and more stylish.&lt;br /&gt;One thing made me wonder was the hiccup in the pulsing which I thought may be a malfunction, until I read the instructions. It is a timer.&lt;br /&gt;The water flow on/off button is tight, but may loosen with use.</li>
    <li> Great quality and necessary for a healthy nouth</li>
    <li> The only thing, I dislike is how hard the switch on pick handle is to slide from the ON/OFF position.</li>
    <li> The number of attachments with this unit are very helpful. Water container holds a lot of water and pulses every 30 seconds so you can go to another area of your mouth. Works excellently.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product.  As indicted in the manual, after every use the water reservoir must be emptied.  Otherwise, the unit leaks all over the counter.  This wastes water.  This wastes time.  This is a poor engineering design.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik Aquarius is my wife&#x27;s and my first water flosser. We&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks, so my five-star rating is just for the flosser itself and not for how effective it is for removing plaque. We purchased the Waterpik flosser on the recommendation of our dentist, because my wife had to have braces. We like it very much and enjoy just how absolutely easy it is to use and care for. Of course after using first regular then electric toothbrushes all our lives, using something entirely new and alien to us was somewhat awkward at first. But after just a couple of uses we found nothing awkward about the water flosser at all. We are both very comfortable with it. It certainly flushes out food particles caught between your teeth much better than regular floss does. We both think it&#x27;s a great piece of equipment to add to our dental hygiene regimen, and we find nothing wrong with it. The complaints about it &amp;#34;feeling cheap&amp;#34;, about difficulty returning the hand-held unit to its mount, about difficulty with retracting the hose back into place, all seem utterly and totally petty. Just how much cleaner will our teeth be, and how much healthier will our gums be? Well the Waterpik is just a tool. How well we use it and how diligent we are about our dental health will determine that. My wife and I will continue to use our electric toothbrush for brushing, but we look forward to the improvement the Waterpik Aquarius Water Flosser will bring to our overall dental hygiene.</li>
    <li> Waterpik has reduced my need for flossing (not eliminated my need) - and improved my overall oral hygine - short story: I love it!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. Arrived fast. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I like this unit very much, but at first I gave it only four stars because of one problem that I thought must be a small design flaw. On this unit there is an on/off switch on the handle, as well as a power button on the base. The instructions say to turn on the power button, then when you have the tip in your mouth to turn on the switch on the handle, and turn the handle switch off when finished. HOWEVER, I found it almost impossible to turn the water switch on and off without using two thumbs. I simply could not do it while it was in my mouth, even after I had used for nearly a month. When I called the company I was told just to work the switch back and forth several times for a few days, but this did not work So, I resorted to simply turning the power button on and off, and ignoring the on/off switch on the handle. This seems to work fine (and I found myself wondering why they even had a switch on the handle) .BUT I also went to the company website and recorded my comments there. I was pleasantly surprised to receive a phone call from a company representative just a few days later, telling me that this was unusual and that they would immediately sent me a replacement handle. It came in just a few days, and it worked beautifully! So I am really pleased with this company. the flosser works very well. I use it after I have brushed and flossed with regular floss, and nearly always I will dislodge at least a little more of something that was not dislodged before.I had a portable water flosser that I bought back in 2007, but it finally wore out, so I decided to replace it with this one.I am glad I did. If you buy one and have a problem similar to the one I described, don&#x27;t hesitate to notify the company (through their website worked better for me than by telephone).&lt;br /&gt;One thing I do not understand is why the company recommends replacing the tips every 6 months. I don&#x27;t see how usage can affect the tips.</li>
    <li> Works well. Does what I expected.</li>
    <li> This is my first water pick so I really am not able to judge how well it performed versus other units.  To me it is messy with water squirting all around but it does dislodge items stuck between the teeth.</li>
    <li> Oh my god.  How the hell did I ever do life with out this.</li>
    <li> It does the job, brushing is not enough when you have braces.</li>
    <li> I have always used a waterpix and love this one so far. Its compact and easy to use with various attachments.</li>
    <li> After reading good reviews on Waterpik Aquarius Water Flosser . I decided to purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this product it works well but is a little noisy but I&#x27;m sure they all are.</li>
    <li> Very good, like the options and bigger holding water capacity. Works great.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for anyone who uses a waterpik.</li>
    <li> One of the best products I&#x27;ve ever purchased; I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long. A must have for dental health.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the great reviews, but ended up being disappointed. It&#x27;s great for getting food out of my braces but I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s as effective as dental floss. Also, the on off switch is really hard for me to move so it&#x27;s more messy than I&#x27;d prefer (water occasionally gets shot across the room) because there&#x27;s no way to pause the water flow. I would give it more stars if I could use the on/off button with one hand.</li>
    <li> Plenty of pressure. Good selection of wands.</li>
    <li> Mouth health +10000.  I have struggled with finding time to floss and when I do, I am not great at it.  This water flosser has completely changed the health of my teeth and especially my gums.  I could tell where I had pockets (which I was frequently lectured about from my dental assistant).  After about a month, I know the pockets were cleaned and gone.  It was confirmed by my dentist.  This probably saved me from more severe issues down the road.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works great, not sure if it&#x27;s worth the extra money vs the lower model. (This doesn&#x27;t have much storage, only for two tips) but it does clean the plaque off the teeth very well.</li>
    <li> The older model? it had a storage compartment on the lid where you could put your other tips. This one has a space to the left of the water tank, albeit a bit smaller, maybe two tips&#x27; worth of space. The older one also looked sleeker, more modern. This one looks clunkier, due to the visually outstanding dial. Maybe it&#x27;s a more grippy design for slippy fingers?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recall if the older one had a switch on the handle to control the flow. However, it&#x27;s easy to press the tip release button instead, without practice, resulting in getting squirted, so watch for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a gum massage feature, which I don&#x27;t use. On the old model you could simulate this, I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one also seems to have the same hose design which may develop a break near the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apart from that, it works well. Shoots a jet of water between teeth to clean out leftovers. Note, however, that in some cases you will still need to use floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely this, or something like this, should be part of your dental care regimen.</li>
    <li> water pressure is week. There is not compartment to save all your tips like the older model. White color gets dirty quickly. It is made of a type of plastic that traps dust and dirt. Stick to the original model. They tried to make it better but they made it worse instead.</li>
    <li> On the recommendation of my dental hygienist, I acquired this.  I floss and brush of course and then use this with a water/fluoride mouthwash mix.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended product for most dentists now a days. Great economical price. The product works like a charm.....</li>
    <li> Having braces, flossing is extremely difficult. This was the best investment I ever made. I don&#x27;t have to ever floss the old school way again!</li>
    <li> Perfect product and price for my needs.  I especially love the array of brushes that came with the unit.</li>
    <li> wouldn&#x27;t be without it</li>
    <li> Works great. What&#x27;s more is its so quick to use I actually use it.</li>
    <li> Love the water pick. They help get lots of stuff out of teeth even after brushing.  My last one broke after many years. This was a replacement. Dentist&#x27;s like water piks.</li>
    <li> i got my item and it doesnt even work and to refund and ship it back is going to cost me 40-50 bux when i bought it for 70 dollars whats the point dud item dont buy !!</li>
    <li> very good,come from China</li>
    <li> best money I have spent in a long time, this is a very good product and my teeth and gums feel great</li>
    <li> (UPDATE 8/6/15): Just came back after a regular cleaning at the dentist and he noticed significant improvement in the health of my gums. During my prior cleaning in January of this year, my gums were experiencing a lot of inflammation during the cleaning. I&#x27;ve only been using this waterpik for a little over 3 months and I&#x27;m just amazed in how much it has helped my oral health. Again, I still highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for about a week and I have seen a significant improvement in the health of my gums. I suffered from gingivitis and regular flossing just wasn&#x27;t helping. But after using the waterpik for about a week, my gums are no longer red. Using the waterpik has been a wonderful process that I look forward to everyday. My periodontist is the person who recommended the waterpik when he was examining the health of my gums. I highly recommend this product to anyone who is considering purchasing it. It seems pricey, but its worth every single penny. If I somehow accidentally break mine (which I highly doubt that would happen) I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate on purchasing another waterpik.</li>
    <li> Great product! Works effectively for my bridge. I also like the different power levels you can choose from.</li>
    <li> Loved it. I little getting used to it; watched some Youtube videos for help. But works well - great check up at the dentist!</li>
    <li> Love it! works better than flossing!</li>
    <li> The hand piece &amp;#34;turn on&amp;#34; button is difficult to move and the motor seems very loud but other than that it works just fine.</li>
    <li> It is fine, but I was disappointed that there wasn&#x27;t any storage for the extra tips.  At first, I could not turn it on.  I called the number on the packaging and was told to &amp;#34;force&amp;#34; it.  It felt like it was going to break.  It didn&#x27;t and it works fine.</li>
    <li> I contacted the manufacturer and asked if I could use the unit for more than 5 minutes every 2 hours as indicated by the manual, they said no the motor would blow up.  What a piece of junk.  What your paying for here is the name Waterpik.  All its products are made with cheap Chinese motors that can&#x27;t last for more than 5 minutes for every 2 hours.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Waterpik Water Flosser for years and I can&#x27;t live without one.  It&#x27;s really good for people with braces. I am lazy about flossing so this is a good alternative for those who do not like to floss.  I am not sure if it is as good as flossing but my dentist has not said that I need to floss better.  I bought this one recently to replace an old one I had that was leaking water where the tube is.  I was looking for a replacement part for it but the review of the replacement part wasn&#x27;t very good so I decided to just buy a new machine.  So far this new one is working well, there is a dial that lets you control how fast water shoots out and the handle has a control that limits how much water shoots out.  The well comes off so that you can rinse it and dry it. It is not very big so it doesn&#x27;t take up very much room on my bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do much of anything.</li>
    <li> quiet .easy filling....good tip storage...good tips......good tips with  brushes..  handle  coils well&lt;br /&gt;small footprint on counter</li>
    <li> Just try it once! You will find how efficient it works immediately. Love it!</li>
    <li> Best investment I have ever made for my teeth.</li>
    <li> It just arrive and i was soo excited to use it the problem is, it doesnt even turn on. As in no power at all! Please help me have a refund or please send me a new one.</li>
    <li> I might have liked this product more if I hadn&#x27;t gotten the Philips air pick instead. As a caveat I have to confess that at the moment I have a couple of teeth that need some serious attention from a dentist. These teeth turned out to be extremely sensitive to this Waterpik Water Flosser. I used this on one of my problem teeth right after setting it up, and my jaw was throbbing for minutes afterwards. So if your teeth - whether one or all of them - are temperature sensitive, there could be a lot of time you wouldn&#x27;t be able to use this. The Philips, on the other hand, I have been able to use, even though it utilizes blasts of air (or mouthwash or water if you have filled its reservoir with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other problem I had was testing it alongside the Philips. I found that if I used the Philips first, the WaterPik was unable to find much else to clean. But if I reversed it, significant amounts of plaque or other things were dislodged by the Philips that the WaterPik mixed. So I ended up giving the WaterPik to a friend with the intention of using only the Philips in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved waterpiks since I was little (and mostly used it as a little squirtgun to make a mess in the bathroom), so I was excited to get to try a new one, as I&#x27;ve had my old set for almost 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This waterpik is a bit more compact than the version I had, but the capacity is about the same and it comes with a ton of accessories (many of which I&#x27;d lost from my old one).  The good news is the old ones I still have fit this set, so I have some spares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This waterpik is noticably quieter than my older one, I can use it on full blast in the master bathroom without disturbing my sleeping partner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the way the hose is coiled.  It&#x27;s a bit of a pain to get back into the holder and it&#x27;s a tad springy so sometimes it makes it awkward to use.  I&#x27;d really like them to use a nicer quality, un-coiled hose that maybe has a take-up reel or some other option for storage.  It&#x27;s a pretty minor complaint though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like every waterpik I&#x27;ve used before, your mouth and teeth will feel exceptionally clean after using this.  Even with a good brushing, I seem to always get a decent amount of debris out with this pik, without the pain and annoyance of regular flossing.</li>
    <li> Best item,  works great,  super fast shipping!!!</li>
    <li> My gums and teeth feel great. Easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I have been a faithful string flosser for years but as I get older, my teeth are failing due to my Rx&#x27;s. My dentist suggested that I get a Waterpik, and only a Waterpic. I have been using it for 3 weeks and I am happy with it. It has a learning curve, as least for me. However, after a week I discovered that I have better control holding onto the tip instead of the handle. I set it to 8, use the entire water reservoir on my top teeth (front, back and in between) then refill and repeat with my lower teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this flosser.</li>
    <li> Works good. Just a bit awkward because the wand is attached to it with a spiral cord.</li>
    <li> Does a wonderful job. Many pics to chose from. Does not take up a lot of room on counter. Just had dental implants completed and this is just what was recommended!</li>
    <li> I would definitely stick to flossing.  Not worth the money.  It&#x27;s messy and really doesn&#x27;t do a good job of flossing. My sister is a dentist and told me all this before I decided to ignore her advice and buy it anyway.  Oh well, wish I had listened.</li>
    <li> Perfect.  My husband and I used this every night. Perfect</li>
    <li> Super loud. Doesn&#x27;t really feel like it&#x27;s that strong of a stream. (Caveat: i haven&#x27;t tried any other waterpik so this might be normal)</li>
    <li> Second pik - compared to my first one which I gave  to my spouse . Definitely lighter in weight and materials.  Still gets the job done with a gum massager which pulsates through the head.  This model times and cycles so there is no guesswork in use. Cute footprint as it doesn&#x27;t take up much counter space. Price has dropped considerably.  You&#x27;ll. love your smile all over again.</li>
    <li> It function as expected. The only problem is that I couldn&#x27;t find the power requirements, so i expected it to function on 220 V as well. I had to add a power transformer.</li>
    <li> It does all that that it advertises to do and does it well. My wife uses it every evening as part of her oral hygiene and loves it.</li>
    <li> I liked my previous older model better, but it does the job like my old one.  It just leaks a lot of water when using.</li>
    <li> I cant use the product as the plug cant be used in my country . After buying adaptor the product still cant be used very very dissappointed</li>
    <li> The flosser works well and gets the job done.  My quibble is with the switches.  This model has two on/off switches, one on the base and one on the wand.  My previous water flosser only had the switch on the base.  Trying to get used to it - have already sprayed my bathroom by forgetting to turn off the switch on the wand.  Also, the switch on the wand is difficult to move into the on/off position.  It does not move easily.</li>
    <li> Good product but too messy.  Did not prevent accumulation of plaque in lower teeth, even though I brush 5 times a day and floss using conventional floss.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted and works like a pro....</li>
    <li> has really helped my gums -- my dentist even said so!!</li>
    <li> My daughter just got braces and now I don&#x27;t have to look at food stuck in them.  Works well.  A little too expensive in my opinion.  Good quality.</li>
    <li> I was shocked at how much this WaterPik has made a difference in my gum health and dental check ups – I wish I had started using it 20 years ago ! My only complaint is that the switch to turn &amp;#34;on and off&amp;#34;  On the hand held piece  is difficult to use – a pushbutton would&#x27;ve been much more convenient - it turns out it&#x27;s very important to be able to start and stop the irrigation using the piece you&#x27;re holding in your hand versus the larger unit itself .</li>
    <li> the ONLY complaint i might have is that the water reservoir runs out quickly, otherwise it works great…my new favorite :)</li>
    <li> This product works really well. I just got braces and it works great for getting out all the food particles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about this - maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong?  It splashes the mirror and doesn&#x27;t seem to be strong enough to actually be cleaning my teeth...</li>
    <li> The tank will provide some 90 seconds of water, long enough for one use.</li>
    <li> Good price. Quality product</li>
    <li> The machine makes a loud noise and it vibrates.</li>
    <li> Its really nice and functional</li>
    <li> Removes particles after you think you have done thorough brushing job.  Has definitely made my gums healthier.</li>
    <li> It feels cheap.  The whole thing shakes when turn up higher.</li>
    <li> My gums have never felt better...This is too crazy. Didn&#x27;t think my mouth would feel this fresh nightly and my gums would be super white and healthy looking. It does the job. 30 seconds for the top row of teeth and after the pause, another 30 seconds for the bottom row of teeth. Afterward, switch over to Massage mode for 10-15 seconds and you&#x27;re good to go. Brush your teeth and use mouthwash beforehand so that you get that fresh feeling fully in your mouth. Good luck and enjoy it.</li>
    <li> Will of course need to see the results of this on my next dental cleaning</li>
    <li> This works as advertised. The tank has plenty of capacity for a single use. So far I like it.  Is not too large but does take some counter space.</li>
    <li> First time user of a water pressure based flosser and I am happy with the results so far.  The unit is small enough to fit on the vanity next to my sink without being bulky.  I use the plaque seeker tip and have good results with it. I love the ability to adjust the water pressure as some of my back teeth are more sensitive and need less pressure.  The only drawback to the unit for me is how noisy it is when it is turned on.  I know there are several models of Waterpik to choose from, but if you&#x27;re looking for a basic, compact model with adjustable water pressure, this is a good choice.</li>
    <li> This is the fourth or fifth Waterpik I  have owned in the past 10 or more years.  It has outlasted all the others (some of which&lt;br /&gt;quit working after only a week or less of daily use).  This model has a pressure dial that  is easy to use.  I set it to a comfortable&lt;br /&gt;level and have not changed it since --about in the middle of its range.  At that setting it is quite efficient at jetting out fragments&lt;br /&gt;of food from between my teeth, front and back,  usually on the first go-&#x27;round.  I add hydrogen peroxide at a ratio of about 1: 6 to tap water, and so far that seems not to have caused any damage to the pumping mechanism --unlike earlier models that did not survive.&lt;br /&gt;I intend to continue to use this Waterpik until it quits, then will probably buy another one like it.</li>
    <li> its fine, does its job and im wondering if it ruins the enamel of the teeth still. i have braces so i like it. much better than flossing so i do recommend this thing. its not the best but it works. The on off button is impossible to switch its very hard on mine. and it is loud so i usually use it evening before bed when everyone is awake still. cant travel with this obviously</li>
    <li> This is the first Water Flosser I have used and am having a great time, really feels good against my gums. The only problem I have had so far is the switch on the handle to turn water on or off is too tight for me to move. I&#x27;ve only been able to used it twice so I just leave it in the on position and make sure the pik is in my mouth when I press the floss button.</li>
    <li> An excellent product that works as advertsed</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My 3rd Waterpik and the best model.  I really like the gum massager feature.</li>
    <li> Good product. Flosses well. Better than regular floss.</li>
    <li> teeth feel better after usage. good product</li>
    <li> Gets a lot more crud out of my teeth and gums than the airfloss, but much messier, too.  Something that your significant other will enjoy watching you use because you either have to shut it off and spit every 15 seconds or let the water just flow from your open mouth into the sink.  Very effective.</li>
    <li> Great product. Use it twice a day.</li>
    <li> Years of using various water flosser machines, this is the BEST,&lt;br /&gt;Reservoir is self covering an ample volume.&lt;br /&gt;Order one to take on my travels, but didn&#x27;t realize the outlet was 220V....in an instant it blew without a sound.  Plugged it in on arrival in London and NOTHING😪&lt;br /&gt;If Apple products can work on either voltages, come on Waterpik,,,,</li>
    <li> Works great gets my teeth clean and keeps my gums healthy</li>
    <li> We got this for our 15 year old son because he has braces and it is hard to floss. He loves using it and it works great</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first, but after having this for a few years now I&#x27;m glad I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;• Easy to Use - Fill it with warm water or water mixed with mouthwash (same amount of mouthwash you&#x27;d normally use diluted in the water), choose the intensity and your head attachment, put the wand end in your mouth, make sure the switch on the wand is turned on (I leave mine turned on), turn the power button on, start at a back molar and work your way forward, keeping your head tilted forward and lips puckered so the water pours out into the sink.&lt;br /&gt;• Efficacy - More effective and faster than flossing. At least that&#x27;s what the internet says, but here&#x27;s my point: I never would floss, but this is so easy and quick I can do it every night with no worry. It also leaves your mouth feeling refreshed and rinsed before you brush and mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;• Oral Hygiene - The water pushes bacteria and food particles out, effectively doing the same job as flossing and mouthwashing. It also helps promote periodontal health by stimulating circulation in your gums, which can help them to heal faster and fight infections better.&lt;br /&gt;• No pain or bleeding if you just start, unlike flossing. Just start on the lowest sensitivity and work your way up.&lt;br /&gt;• Multiple Options - With various heads so you can actually brush your teeth with it, use different spray types, and the pulsating massage mode for massaging gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;• Expensive, especially compared to floss.&lt;br /&gt;• The on/off switch is difficult to change with one hand. This doesn&#x27;t affect me though as I leave it on and just use the power button on the machine to start and stop water flow.&lt;br /&gt;• Can be loud, if you&#x27;re trying to floss while others are asleep.&lt;br /&gt;• Not portable like floss is. Even if you get the handheld version (terrible idea) you have to dispose of the water, so you can&#x27;t floss while you read or watch TV like with standard floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS:&lt;br /&gt;• Putting a washcloth or grip pad (like what you line cabinets with or what you open the pickle jar with) under the unit to help lower the vibrations&lt;br /&gt;• Once a month do a cleaning rinse: Clean the basin out with vinegar, allowing it to soak for an hour and put the wand tips in with it - this will kill odor causing germs. Pour that out and do a full hot water rinse to get the vinegar out, then do a hydrogen peroxide rinse. The peroxide will kill any mildew spores inside the tubing.&lt;br /&gt;• Don&#x27;t leave water in the basin, or put any non-liquid or sticky additives in. I&#x27;ve put mouthwash in before as a rinse aid, but that&#x27;s it. You don&#x27;t want stuff clogging the tubing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After over two years it&#x27;s still performing like new, staying clean inside and out, and my teeth have never been healthier! I&#x27;ve also not seen any signs of leaking like others have experienced. The only time I get water on the counter is if it runs along the hose and drips off.d (like what you line cabinets with or what you open the pickle jar with) under the unit to help lower the vibrations&lt;br /&gt;• Once a month do a cleaning rinse: Clean the basin out with vinegar, allowing it to soak for an hour and put the wand tips in with it - this will kill odor causing germs.

    <li> Ok except the on/off button on the wand is very hard to work. Otherwise seems to do the job. Kind of an old fashioned tool.</li>
    <li> sent this one back it was too big to put anywhere</li>
    <li> First time use...easy and works</li>
    <li> Really does work and my teeth feel cleaner especially in the hard to reach places.</li>
    <li> This thing makes no sense. It doesn&#x27;t provide water at a high enough velocity. In addition by the time you start to use it and find the right angle, the water is finished out of the dispensary. Rubbish!</li>
    <li> I had to have major dental work done, I ordered this Waterpik and I LOVE it... I showed it to my dentist who is now telling his clients about it. The major thing they liked about it is it has 21 oz of water. Which from what they said it a lot more flossing going on which is a good thing.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product which I am very pleased with</li>
    <li> The on/off button on the handle is a real chore to use and has only gotten harder.  I used to be a fan of water-pics and bought this one because I was tired of using a toothpick.  It does the job, but my periodonist said it&#x27;s useless and scraping with a toothpick is better.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t near as powerful as the one I have before.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> the water pick is great.</li>
    <li> So much better than the old design....more compact. Works great&#x27;</li>
    <li> replaced my old one!!!! My teeth always feel like I just had my teeth cleaned at the dentist</li>
    <li> It does a good job.  I rated 4 because it is difficult to use off and on button on the Pik handle.</li>
    <li> Good tool to clean teeth.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended I purchase a Waterpik water flosser. I have no point of reference with other brands. It is a well made appliance with helpful instructions and a variety of piks. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Best money I&#x27;ve ever spent. Gets food out of your teeth better than flossing.</li>
    <li> First time waterpik-ers, and we must say this have been a great addition to our oral hygienic routine. It cleans in between teeth and massages the gums. As bad as it may sound, this does a better job than flossing alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not the most gracious process, but it works. The only con I would say is that the button to turn on the spray is a little hard to maneuver. Takes a few push to get it to slide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s small and compact and takes very little counter space.</li>
    <li> Replaced an old waterpik after the hose got brittle and broke.  This model has a much smaller reservoir but seems to work better.  Water seems to last longer despite the smaller container.  I don&#x27;t use the massage function but it&#x27;s nice to have the option.  Cannot comment on the durability but the construction feels solid. Smaller footprint too which I like.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement</li>
    <li> Arrived perfectly fine and on time. No gripes there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works as intended. If you&#x27;re having problems using this at first, you can try reading the instructions.  It gives a pretty good explanation as to how you should be using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with 2 extra standard tips for those of you who want to share this product with a family member or something.  The extra tips are color coded as white, grey, and blue respectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other tips in this package include a deep cleaning tip, a tip to clean bracers, and a toothbrush tip.  The book doesn&#x27;t really explain how to use any of these extra tips, so I would ask your orthodontist for further information about these before using them. Or you can just use them however you want, doesn&#x27;t matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason why I didn&#x27;t give this product 5 stars is because I&#x27;m not entirely sure how effective this actually is in terms of cleaning your teeth.  I&#x27;ve brushed my teeth, used this, and flossed, and the floss still picked up some stuff off my teeth even though it was the last to be used.  This certainly does not replace flossing, at least.  But decent product overall.  Just a bit hard to measure the actual effectiveness.</li>
    <li> I have two gaps under some crowns that always get food caught and I&#x27;d spend extra extra time flossing to try to get it all out. Now I use this and it works fantastic. I love it!</li>
    <li> SUPER PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using WaterPic for many years..this is a superior product!&lt;br /&gt;Norma</li>
    <li> better than my old water pik  much easier to use and  does  a lot  more  to get the gunk out</li>
    <li> My best Waterpik ever.  I have used two prior models until they broke (each lasted a good few years with daily use).  This one works just as well and the the design is new, fresh and neat.  Refilling is an improvement over the prior model I had.  This product does a great job of keeping teeth &amp;#34;flossed&amp;#34; and gums strong and healthy.  My dentist always remarks how superior my oral health and hygiene are, and this machine gets most if the credit.  Everyone should have one.</li>
    <li> This is our second one [this one for my wife,same model] - The first one was a gift for me. We have used Waterpiks, various models, for many years. This one beats them all and looks much more confidence inspiring for quality and reliability. .</li>
    <li> My dentist is always warning me about gingivitis, so I am an avid flosser. I thought the regular flossing tape was doing a good job until I found this flosser. The unit itself is durable and easy to set up; the different heads serve different purposes, and it&#x27;s nice to rotate between them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is best about this product, however, is that it produces results! My dentist told me at my recent checkup that my gums looked better than ever. I attribute my good dental health to this water flosser!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great product for those concerned about their oral hygiene.</li>
    <li> Apparently some people preferred their older models, but actually I like this a lot better.  Takes up less space and seems to have a better fitting arrangement where the water goes in to the pump, so I&#x27;m hopeful that the problem with the little rubber grommet at the bottom of the container won&#x27;t leak.  I like the little timer as well, and the water pressure is just as good as the other models.  Besides that, I think they must get kind of grimy after a while inside the pump, so replace the old one and get something new!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I bought this on the recommendation from my dentist. Your teeth feel like they just got cleaned from the dentist!</li>
    <li> Does everything it&#x27;s advertised to do.  10 levels of intensity of pulsing water stream to choose from. You&#x27;re also able to choose between gum massage or water flossing with the push of a button.  I see some people reviewing say it&#x27;s difficult to remove the tip. Well, if you slide the side button up, the tip pops off instantly and easily. To re-attach, just slip it into the handle until it snaps in place. Doesn&#x27;t get much easier than that.  I also read where the wand button is &amp;#34;difficult&amp;#34; to move.  When the unit is in the &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; mode, the button slides easily. When you turn it on, it&#x27;s a tiny bit difficult because of the built up water pressure............but I didn&#x27;t find it all that bad at all and don&#x27;t understand what all the fuss is about. I slid the handle button on and off with minimal thumb pressure at setting 1 then dialed it up to 10. Once the water was gone, I was able to retract the handle thumb button easily.  Comes with a total of 7 attachments but no &amp;#34;case&amp;#34; to store them in. I did find that Amazon carries  the &amp;#34; Waterpik Convenient Hygienic Sturdy Storage Case for Replacement Tips , 6 Count&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s a tip storage case that comes with 6 tips--- 2 classic jets, 2 plaque seekers and 2 Orthodontic tips all for around 15 bucks.  They also sell just the case without any replacement tips for around 9 bucks.  The tips that come with this Storage case do fit the WP600,  as well as several other units Waterpik sells. For a full list of compatible units, go online to Waterpik for a complete list.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend using warm water so it&#x27;s not as big shock to your teeth, especially if you&#x27;ve got tooth sensitivity issues.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  Took a couple tries to get used to.  You might spray water everywhere the first couple times, then you sorta learn how to do it without making a giant mess.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are packed very tightly together so it&#x27;s unlikely to replace flossing, but what it does do is really get under the gums and get rid of bacteria/plaque and particles.  I can already tell already my gums are happier and I will continue to use it.  One of these should be standard in anyone&#x27;s dental routine.</li>
    <li> It helps keep my gums clean. I add in a small amount of natural dentist mouthwash then run it again with just water.</li>
    <li> In the past was informed of the benefits of using a water flosser. I am a natural sceptic, so I researched and decided to try one out. The Waterpik Aquarius had excellent review on amazon, and other sites as well.&lt;br /&gt;Upon arrival, the first thing I noticed was the weight of the Aquarius. It seemed extremely light to me, but I was pleasantly surprised by that, considering the pressure you can build up with the pump running it! After the first try, this product was amazing, normal areas of the mouth that were troublesome before are nice and clean. I was pleasantly surprised at the feeling.&lt;br /&gt;The only downfall I have found is the amount of storage for the tips. Only 2 can be added older the cap, with no room for more. It would be nice if the 7 tips had storage for all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, excellent product.</li>
    <li> i purchased one of these but a different model from my dentist about 10 months ago and it broke. i just purchased this and used it. i love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;and it&#x27;s $100 less than what i paid on my previous one. THanks</li>
    <li> I like the small size and the sleek look but...I have had TWO of these and each one after about 5-6 mos the buttons quit working and you have to toss it! Design defect. And of course you cant return it after 6 mos. Don&#x27;t buy this product till they fix the issues.</li>
    <li> This thing keeps my grill lookin&#x27; white.</li>
    <li> This flosser is AMAZING! i am very satisfied with the product, I have dental issues which it demands visit to the dentist every 6 months for a cleanup. With this i can say that the visits will be much more relaxing and pain free.  LOVE IT</li>
    <li> If your GFCI trips out when you are using your Waterpik the GFCI needs to be replaced. My GFCI has never tripped while using it. GFCI are required near water , bathroom , kitchens sinks ,ETC. There are many defective GFCIs.</li>
    <li> A little big if you have limited bathroom space and not effective for my bridge which is why I bought it</li>
    <li> Works well, the only thing is the on/off button on the handle sticks.  So I turn it on/off on the reservoir .</li>
    <li> best one they&#x27;ve ever made... very happy with it!</li>
    <li> Got this for a friend who had one but it broke after years of use.  It was the perfect gift. She love it.</li>
    <li> This machine works exactly as described. If you hate to floss, then this is the next best thing.</li>
    <li> My rating is Excellent - Item delivered on time, and as described.  This was 1 great deal and I would recommend!! :)</li>
    <li> Replacement for and much better than my busted Sonicare flosser. Dentist says I doing it right. Be prepared to wipe the mirror a few extra times, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Good deal on time and works great</li>
    <li> I bought this to have in my house when my son visits because he loves it.  I did not expect to use it very often myself, but in fact, I love the way my mouth feels after using.  I would give it five stars, but it is very messy to use which is a deterrent.  It would also be better if it held more water so that you only had to fill it once to do your whole mouth. I have to fill it at least twice.</li>
    <li> My teeth don&#x27;t hurt any more!</li>
    <li> There are two issues with this Waterpik:&lt;br /&gt;1) the hose is too stiff -- use would be improved by a less stiff hose which would uncoil more easily;&lt;br /&gt;2) The on/off switch on the Waterpik handle is excessively stiff to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An additional suggestion to Waterpik for improving the product would be for them to design into the product and make available an accessory kit to tap into the cold water fitting/valve under the sink - thus bypassing the need to use and refill the water reservoir.</li>
    <li> Overall this is a good water flosser. I owned the previous version and I did like there was a button to hold down on the handle to pause the water flow, verus the on-off switch on the handle of this new version. I guess it will just take some getting used to.</li>
    <li> Was surprised by the amount of trapped food particles it removed from my mouth!</li>
    <li> This works great and have tried other devises but this out does them. I would definitely recommend this product. I have noticed an improvement in my gums since using this</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product. I wish the base was more heavy so that it doesn&#x27;t top over when the top was filled with water.</li>
    <li> I Thought that I won the Lottery!! My last Waterpik worked fine until a leak developed  on the tube at the handle.Decided at 1:00 AM to get a replacement from Amazon. Prime worked like a charm!!&lt;br /&gt;New unit arrived 5PM same day.I assembled it just before going to bed About Midnight.The new unit is lighter in weight, Looks / and feels like they tried to save a few bucks. AND they probably did?? I could not use it !! No water massage,no flossing ! No Nothing !! The OFF/ ON switch could NOT be moved from OFF to ON. Do not think that I didn&#x27;t try.&lt;br /&gt; On my last unit the switch was PRESSED , it worked every time !!! On this one you must SLIDE the switch from OFF to ON .. With two thumbs it will not move! I tried for ah hour reading and rereading the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;I was an Airplane Mechanic &amp; Specialist Engineer on Lockheed Airliners.I always solved my challenges ! Not this time!! No visible means of correction except REPLACEMENT with a better unit.&lt;br /&gt; It is 1:22 AM, About 24 hours since I ordered it !!  I did not hit the JACKPOT !!! Customer Service Later today!! Maybe a 1/2 Star would be more appropriate.? So much for the great experience!! Back where I started  24 hours ago !!</li>
    <li> Using this 2 weeks now and love the way it makes my gums feel.  Easy to use too!  No complaints so far -- let&#x27;s hope it stays like this long-term as others had issues with this item.</li>
    <li> Top rated can&#x27;t find any better for the money. 😁😁😀😀😀😀😀</li>
    <li> Great product.  I use it everyday and my dentist is always impressed with the health of my teeth and gums. The toothbrush attachment is useless in my opinion.</li>
    <li> very pleased, as I would expect for a premium product. Specially like the on-off switch on the handle, rather than the pause button on the lower priced models.</li>
    <li> First time using a waterpik. Works well but not sure if better than floss.  On off at handle is nice.</li>
    <li> I want a waterpik to use in France and I receive an apparel only for USA.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not conform.&lt;br /&gt;I send you back the waterpik and I&#x27;m waiting for my monay back.</li>
    <li> Makes flossing easier</li>
    <li> I use my Waterpik daily and have had no issues. It appears to deliver on the promise to improve your oral hygiene.</li>
    <li> This is the second Waterpik I owned.  It got all the belt and whistle, the earlier model lack.  Much easier to make the suction.  The only honest (relatively speaking) dentist whom I have ever found, unfortunately now retired, recommended the use of Waterpik.  With the Flosser, using the Plaque Seeker tip, you can literally see food stuff being flushed out.  I have recommended to all my family members and friends.  Even though the Plaque Seeker tip needs replacement every 6 months or so, it is still worthwhile considering how much your &amp;#34;friendly&amp;#34; dentist will charge you for dental work, not to mentioned the cost and pain with implants!</li>
    <li> If you do not complete empty the water bowl, you will return to your bath counter to find a puddle of water.  Since this is my first waterpik, I am not sure if this is normal, but I don&#x27;t particularly like it for that reason.</li>
    <li> This product has changed our lives.  We are now so addicted, we hate to go to bed without waterpiking.  I was mildly (and my husband quite) concerned about gum recedence, but it stopped immediately upon use.  Plaque buildup is much slower and our mouths simply feel clean and smell great.</li>
    <li> Frankly I&#x27;m sorry I purchased this item. I had previously used an Interplak water flosser and been quite pleased with it, but decided to change because of the hype that said Waterpik was so much better. Boy, was I disappointed! The ON-OFF switch is very hard to operate. Sometimes have to use two hands instead just using my thumb. The hose that houses the Waterpik itself is very short, and it&#x27;s also quite stiff and doesn&#x27;t stretch out easily. Have to keep the entire machine very close to me so that I can floss, but it&#x27;s a real chore I will have to keep it, I guess, because I can&#x27;t afford another $60.00 for a different machine, but I would not recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> Really not certain how to rate this as I could never use it.  The reason it was not used was because the start button would not move.  Since I had a previous edition, I just returned it.  I assumed that if they could not even get the start button right, there was not much use bothering with it.</li>
    <li> The pump stopped working after 8 months.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m amazed at what it does. Personally I could use a slightly slimmer design so it will fit in the cabinet. Our bathroom is to small to leave on sink 24/7. But that&#x27;s a bathroom issue not a product issue so I&#x27;m not deducting a star for it.&lt;br /&gt;I had my teeth cleaned about a week before it arrived and was already noticing that no so clean feeling on my teeth. This took care of it right away and I feel just like I did walking out of the dentists office.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep you updated if this holds. Oh, and the massage function feels good, but I can not yet say if it does any good.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Great little machine. Not quiet but I&#x27;m only running it for a minute. Gets the job done and clean.</li>
    <li> It works really good but it just makes a little bit of a mess but that is to be ex</li>
    <li> A friend of mine had a WaterPik and ranted and rave about it all the time so I wanted to see what all the fuss was about and purchased this WaterPik. Needless to say I understand what all the fuss is about. I have several gaps in my teeth and this removes the food and other stuff stuck in my teeth very easily. Be careful not to turn it on to high, or it can slice your gums. It happened to both my husband and I but once we learn how to properly use it we have loved it. All the attachments are great.</li>
    <li> Works great! Gets the job done!</li>
    <li> But with an excellent improvement in performance too. It starts pumping quickly and is much quieter than the previous Waterpiks that I&#x27;ve owned so I think it is well worth the extra money. Would definitely buy another one.</li>
    <li> it works well, but sometimes it still can not get it all clean if  a slice of food stuck in there. I already use relative low pressure, but sometimes it hurts, maybe it is just my teeth I guess.</li>
    <li> The waterpik is working well.  It is quite noisy.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and she loves it!!!</li>
    <li> I expected more from this product given the impressive reviews. It&#x27;s a little messy to use, water gets all over the place. It&#x27;s loud &amp; takes up a lot of counter space.</li>
    <li> This little unit, though canned by many who have other models, works perfectly for me and takes up only a small amount of precious counter space. Seems durable enough to me. I am pleased and hope my dentist will be too!</li>
    <li> My dentist&#x27;s reports have been excellent since I have started using this.</li>
    <li> searched around to find the right product and price, this one is great</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Effective in getting under my bridges and I hate flossing!  I use it at least once a day.</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to receiving this item because my Waterpik was no longer working and I missed it.  I received the new one in good time.  Unfortunately it did not work either.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. I&#x27;ve never been a good flosser, partly because I have a permanent retainer behind my front teeth and also because I never got into the habit of flossing as a child. Several years ago, I bought a cordless water flosser, which was an absolute disaster.  It was large, held only a few seconds worth of water, and was nearly impossible to maneuver in your mouth. I forced myself to get serious about flossing, and used threaders and string with great results, but tartar was still visible around the wire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a single use of this, the impossible to floss tartar was knocked out.  After seeing a dentist for the first time in over  a year, he commented on how clean my teeth were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I strongly recommend this:&lt;br /&gt;1) The reservoir last long enough to clean your entire mouth.  I seem to finish my top/bottom path right as the tank gets to empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) the hose/handheld device is very well designed. This feels much like holding a toothbrush, and I&#x27;ve never had any issues with the hose getting in the way. The utensil is small enough that you can rotate it easily in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) I lean over the sink and &#x27;look down&#x27; when I use this.  All water lands in the sink.  I&#x27;ve had no problems with water coming out anywhere near the tank/pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Tips are super easy to change&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Areas for improvement:&lt;br /&gt;1) The tip holder is hard to access.  I have to remove the tank to get the tips. This isn&#x27;t a big deal since I do not use the holder, and only use one tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The provided tips are angled at 45 degrees or so. It seems difficult to use these behind the very back teeth. It would be nice if they provided guidance on how to clean the gumline of the very back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Misc:&lt;br /&gt;1) Cleaning: When I first got the device, I filled the tank about 1/4 full of rubbing alcohol and water, and then rank the solution through.  I followed this up with 2 full tanks of water. I also gave the tips a quick bath in rubbing alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The package comes with several tips.  I use the standard one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used one before, and found this one very easy to use, sure does a good job.</li>
    <li> Much better than the ViaJet that I had been using for years before it finally died.  Easier to remove tips (I share this unit with my wife), smaller footprint on the counter.  Clever storage of extra tips.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine recommended this. I was in doubt to buy it or not (for the price) but I did. The product quality is awesome, and it cleans your mouth like anything else. I fact, I feel dirty when I dont use it.</li>
    <li> I think a connector to my bathroom sink such as the waterpik filter works would do just fine.  You have to run water until it is warm and fill the decanter before using.  But this beats using floss....really!  And it is supposed to clean better.</li>
    <li> After a long period of using this, I have found that this model was exactly what I was looking for. I had a prior model where the water trigger had to be continuously held in place to stop the water flow which seems backward to me, I thought it made more sense that you moved the switch for the trigger the water flow. The unit also was touchy with the wand release due to the water flow switch configuration. Ultimately after 6 months of use, the water trigger failed. I do not recall the model number of the failing unit. With this model of device, there is an on/off switch - that completely solves both problems since you do not have to constantly be engaged with the switch. The pressure is great, and it has just as many accessories. I have been using this unit regularly for over a year now, and have no regrets with this purchase!</li>
    <li> 1) The device has been designed for an &amp;#34;american&amp;#34; voltage standart of 120V (russian standart is 220V)&lt;br /&gt;By the way, Amazon could prevent the problem with a simple notification!&lt;br /&gt;2) Even after the connection through a special transformer the device doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> I bought this item on a recommendation from a friend.  His dentist told him that a waterpik is far better than flossing and he was right.  my teeth are at least 5 shades whiter and my gums are nice and pink.  The water feels great and even after using floss, the waterpik will still remove small debris that the floss could not get to.  My teeth feel much smoother especially around the gum line.</li>
    <li> It works great and easy to use, helps massage the gums, a most in any home</li>
    <li> I thought it is family use product so will be small, quiet, easy to use, but unfortunately the noise scared me.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Works well as described</li>
    <li> My dentist and my gums love it. Costs less here than with the manufacturer</li>
    <li> This has been one of my better investments! The Waterpik flosser performs exactly as advertised. My teeth feel cleaner, look whiter (I add a little hydrogen peroxide to the water), and my gums look healthier. I recommend this product to anyone interested in keeping their teeth healthy.</li>
    <li> I hated flossing with floss but water flossing...bro. OFF. THE. CHAIN.</li>
    <li> the flosser is very useful,better than other flosser ...</li>
    <li> it is difficult to turn it off and on.  I have to operate it by pressing blue light button rather than off and on on handle.  Also quality is not up to the last one I had purchased on Amazon and paid nearly the same amount.  vivian rocco</li>
    <li> I like the Waterpik brand. My previous Waterpik which was bought over ten years ago, still worked. However, I thought it was time to upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love how this model looks. It has a really nice design and looks very attractive sitting on my bathroom counter. I also like how this model lets you adjust the water pressure. I have a weakness for pistachio nuts and this Waterpik does a great job with getting the left over particles that get stuck between my teeth out. I don&#x27;t even need to set it on it&#x27;s strongest setting (10). The water pressure is nice and strong at level 5. I utilize the floss setting the most and it seems adequate enough. My teeth does feel cleaner after using. I haven&#x27;t tried all of the attachments yet. But I do use the jet tips the most and have tried the circular toothbrush tip as well. The brush is okay but not that great. It&#x27;s does not replace a real tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still a strong believer in flossing with dental tape and I still like to floss after using the Waterpik. I feel the Waterpik adds to my daily oral hygiene care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I have is that I wish they could somehow make these units quieter. Even my old unit made a lot of noise. Otherwise, 2 thumbs up for this model.</li>
    <li> This model (WP-660) of the Waterpik is the best one yet.&lt;br /&gt;The best improvement by far over the last one that I used is the On/Off switch located on the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous one had a button that had to be pushed to keep the water flow OFF.  I thought that was kind of backwards, pushing the button to turn it off - my bathroom mirror and walls can back me up on that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used 2 of the 5 tips available.  There are actually 7 tips but 3 are the same tip (classic jet tip):&lt;br /&gt;Classic Jet Tip and Pik Pocket Tip.&lt;br /&gt;The Jet Tip is the standard tip for most water flossers and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;The Pik Pocket is unique because it creates a extremely fine stream of water and the rubber nozzle allows you to get in between teeth and into any crevices that you can&#x27;t normally reach with the other tips.  I especially like this for the area behind my back molars and the gaps where my wisdom teeth used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other feature that I like is the small footprint this waterpik has on the bathroom sink counter.  Does not take up much space at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product and thank you for the ON/OFF switch!</li>
    <li> Loved it so much, we bought another. I actually look forward to using this every night.</li>
    <li> The first delivery had to be returned as the hand held device was defective; the on and off switch was not functional.  You could not move the button.  The machine was returned and the new one, although a bit better, still has a problem with the on and off button on the hand held device.  The button is rather stiff and not easy to move back and forth.  For something that has had such a high consumer rating, how is it that I&#x27;ve had this difficulty?  (Will use it for a while to see if the button travel improves.  If not, will return the Waterpik to Amazon)</li>
    <li> 2 weeks ago bought. Purchased as a gift again.</li>
    <li> This is the first Waterpik I rate (very generously) one star, 2 in a row from Amazon that did not repond to AC power or the start button, Off to buy a reliable Waterpik, such a good name to make such a shoddy product, sigh</li>
    <li> Just use it after dinner, quite good but need to cooperate with electric toothbrush. I only worry about how long it will last.</li>
    <li> my teeth are spaced tightly against ea. other, this is definitely much easier to manage than floss alone.</li>
    <li> My Bride just got braces and this little jewel works fantastic for her! Happy Wife &#x3D; Happy Life!!</li>
    <li> After a couple less than stellar check-ups and a cavity that I had to get filled, I decided it was time to start taking oral hygiene a bit more seriously. This meant above all else, flossing. I was not good about keeping up with it and I generally hated it. Flossing is usually a painful and bloody ordeal for me, obviously because of my lack of flossing, but it was pretty hard to motivate myself to keep doing it. That&#x27;s when I decided to start looking at other options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had heard of water flossers, but I had no idea they worked as well as they do. After a bit of research and reading, I decided on the Waterpik Aquarius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first time using it was to put it nicely, gross. It dislodged bits and chunks from various parts of my mouth that had been sitting there for who knows how long. I could even smell how gross the stuff getting knocked out was. But when it was all said and done my mouth felt great and cleaner than it had in a long time. Followed with a brush with a Sonicare, and it was like I just left the dentist. My gums felt really good afterwards and weren&#x27;t a bloody mess (although surprisingly, there was still some blood. I&#x27;ll probably tone down the pressure setting next time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flossing with a Waterpik is no longer a chore, it&#x27;s actually kind of enjoyable. I intend to make this a part of my nightly routine and I&#x27;m actually kind of excited for my next dentist appointment now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have had issues flossing but want to do something about it, you should really look into one of these. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> my wife loved her old one and this newer model is lighter and more powerful</li>
    <li> Works well and small footprint so does not take up too much space.</li>
    <li> Its okay.  Wish it had better storage for the attachments.</li>
    <li> I should have gotten one of these years ago.  It really makes your teeth feel clean and gets into the hard to reach spots.</li>
    <li> I check amazon reviews often and the reviews often help me decide which product to buy, I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of great products this way.  I was excited about ordering this because of the great reviews.  But I am disappointed in this, it doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype or all the rave reviews.  I really can&#x27;t tell much of a difference after using it. It&#x27;s also very loud!  I don&#x27;t understand the reasoning behind the design of holding only 2 of the tips when it comes with several more tips.  It would make sense to be able to keep all the tips together.  This is the first flosser I&#x27;ve had but I&#x27;m just not impressed.</li>
    <li> My son and his wife love this.</li>
    <li> more than expected, has head for pocket cleansing as well as regular water pic tip....</li>
    <li> The 660 is a nice design.  It doesn&#x27;t take up too much room on the sink.  The hose is a little tricky to put back neatly, but if you live alone you don&#x27;t have to!&lt;br /&gt;My teeth feel great after using this.  I wish I had bought one sooner!</li>
    <li> It is a water pick. What can I say? One of the little lights does not work. So there is that.</li>
    <li> best purchase for my oral hygiene..&lt;br /&gt;I have difficulty using the string floss..After debating a lot I got this water floss and this is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I add some mouth wash to the water and it makes my mouth so clean and it is very useful.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to anyone who is not good at flossing..this product will bring you back to floss</li>
    <li> My daughter wears braces so regular floss is not useable right now.  She uses the water pic daily and swears by it.</li>
    <li> This item was recommended to me by a dental hygienist and it has worked well for me.</li>
    <li> After reading a variety of reviews on many different water flossers. I chose this one and am glad I did. It holds plenty of water or mouth wash if you prefer to get the job done. I must admit it does seem flimsy compared to the previously owned regular noisy classic model that I had for 15 years until the hose broke at the handle. Yes I know for twelve bucks you can replace it but I think I got my moneys worth out of the old one. Anyway it feels flimsy and it is light weight so I guess we automatically think cheap low quality. But it does the job and I&#x27;d like to think I will get the same or similar life expectancy out of this one.</li>
    <li> We had older versions of this product and were happy with them. This one is a bit of a disappointment. There is no on board storage and it pauses several times during a tank of water. The shut off on the handle is hard to control with one hand. Overall I think the design is regressing.</li>
    <li> Returned for unsatisfactory performance. Awkward to use and hard on the gums.</li>
    <li> Really good!  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> my wife have braces and she use it everyday. my 7-year-old daughter loves it too. it have 3 ordinary tips so everyone in my  home can use it.</li>
    <li> Thank you for the waterpik it&#x27;s as I expected but it take long time to arrive almost a month. 2nd important things the current use of the waterpik is 110 v which is not compatible with Denmark 230v so, I bought a converter  to use it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t find the waterpik to be very user friendly. It is messy, and it really doesn&#x27;t feel the way it does when your dentist flosses your teeth with the water. I feel like I should have bought the battery operated one, or perhaps the one you use in the shower. I would not recommend spending the money on this.</li>
    <li> Our dentist wants us to use the Waterpik and this is the best model we&#x27;ve used over the years.  It&#x27;s compact and quieter than previous models.</li>
    <li> I like it much better than conventional floss.</li>
    <li> Product works amazing. My gums puffed up due to braces and this item was recommended by my orthodontist. On the downside, this product makes waaaay too much noise. I exchanged it and this new one makes even more noise. Not good if you brush your teeth at night and have roommates!</li>
    <li> Much better than the older version.  Hopefully the arm holder won&#x27;t break on this one.  Compact and powerful. Not alot of storage for the floss heads onboard though.</li>
    <li> It was great while it worked.  However, it is broken now and we&#x27;ve had for only 1 month.  It won&#x27;t turn on.  I&#x27;m past the 30 day return policy for Amazon so I guess I will just have to buy a new one since my daughter must have a water pik for her braces.  I wish there was a warranty access button on Amazon to make it easier to follow up with manufacturers on defective products post 30 days.  We threw the packaging away as we weren&#x27;t expecting to have issues or to return it.</li>
    <li> I love using this in addition to brushing. I add a cap of my Pro Health mouthwash to the water and after I&#x27;m done my mouth feels clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> This has taken my cleaning routine to an entirely different level... why in the world did I wait so long to get one! Every dentist should recommend this to every patient.  I can&#x27;t wait until my next cleaning to see if my 4s and 5s are lowered.  I don&#x27;t have any problems putting the handle on the stand like one reviewer mentioned might be a problem, it hasn&#x27;t been a problem for me at all.  I mostly use between 4 and 5 power, higher than that makes my gums sore.  I like the pocket and the brush attachments.  I only wish I could have gotten the black one to match my d&amp;eacute;cor, but only the white one was on sale at the time.  Its not as large as I thought it was going to be, it fits nicely in the corner or my vanity. I have it one side of my single sink vanity an my toothbrush on the other side.</li>
    <li> I feel it did a good job and I am more like to do it than flossing.  the problem is the button to start it is hard to work</li>
    <li> Powerful, make my teeth clean, I like it so much, be careful to use the max gears, it will make you feel pain, increase from the min gears should be a good idea</li>
    <li> I read a very good review from another Italian so I decided to buy it and made it arrive in Indiana, USA, where my sister-in-law lives as my father-in-law was planning to travel there. When we got it we tried it but it doesn&#x27;t work. We do have the power converter but it doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> Great device! I am not a dentist, but I am pretty sure that this device will save me some serious cash in the long run; plus, my teeth feel cleaner than ever!</li>
    <li> I wanted one for years finally got it.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and even better is it&#x27;s kind of fun and a quick way to clean the debris.</li>
    <li> i admit it. i never used to floss regularly,  and i still wont.  BUT I DO use my water pick every morning which is  a huge step up from never flossing.  This will destroy your gums in the first week of using it, but just bear through the blood and guts.  That stops once you start taking better care of your mouth. Pricy,  but cheaper than a root canal.</li>
    <li> I love love love mine.  My mouth feels wonderful afterwards.</li>
    <li> LOL, like a bidet for your mouth, that is my first impression. Seems well built, take a little time to get used to the on/off switch vs the head-release lever. Will update on durability.</li>
    <li> It is easy to use and does the job.</li>
    <li> Everyone should own one of these. The results and difference it makes are amazing! It does take a little time for your gums to get use to the pressure so don&#x27;t panic if they hurt for a while initially.</li>
    <li> Good product but watch the pressure setting. To much pressure can irritate your gums. I found 5 or 6  be just right.</li>
    <li> Works well, but your gums will take some time getting used to the water pressure. I suggest starting low and moving up as you get more comfortable with it. Also it&#x27;s a bit loud to use at night if you live in an an apartment or with roommates/family.</li>
    <li> Product does what it is supposed to do but it&#x27;s still messy.  It&#x27;s a lot smaller than older models so sits on counters easier.  The only negative aspect for us is the storage area.  Not convenient and only 2 spaces.  End up storing extras in cup.</li>
    <li> the product looks nice sharp &amp; clean. water pressure is just right, not too high. will recommend for some one like to purchase. .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a water pik for years. The last one fell apart so I decided to try the Aquiaris water flosser this time. I am not disappointed. It is as good or better than the same water pik I&#x27;ve been using.  The prices is good, it is attractive, easy to use, does a good job and I do recommend it. I think these should be part of your everyday dental hygiene.</li>
    <li> For God&#x27;s sake, don&#x27;t try to use this if anyone is sleeping in the room next-door.  I work late most nights, and the ideal time to use this is right before bed.  Any amount of tiredness that I built up leading up until the moment I raise this little wand to my mouth and press the power button is instantly erased.  This thing couldn&#x27;t be any louder.  I have a 55 gallon aquarium pump filter that is quieter than this, and that was even cheaper.  There is no way this needs to be this loud.  For anyone hoping to use this between 9:30 PM-9:30 AM Beware, you will most likely have the cops called on you or be evicted.</li>
    <li> One of the better Water pics on the market.</li>
    <li> This Waterpik is great.  Everything I expected.  I had the travel model and it gave out in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> The power connector has been out of order (burned) once I connected the power plug very first time.</li>
    <li> A really good product that has the look of quality. It works perfectly and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I love my new water pik.  I use it every day.  It&#x27;s a little loud, but I only use it for about 2 minutes, so that doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> I just got braces back on, this a great tool for getting around the wires, does its job and did some research (I&#x27;m in dental school now too so we&#x27;ve learned a bit about this) the Waterpik is a viable option in place of flossing, but my understanding is that its a good idea to floss at least every few days in combination with using this every day..</li>
    <li> I was really happy after my firts mouth water flossing, its great the feeling that everything is extraclean inside your mouth after doing it. absolutely recommended it</li>
    <li> Since I have braces I started using the water flosser after brushing and flossing my teeth. Then try the water floss after brushing and find out that the regular floss is not needed.</li>
    <li> The waterpik that I discarded was twice as heavy as this one. I had my old one for years and had to let it go due to rubber seal deterioration. This one is ok. The issue I have is there is a slide button on the wand that stops the water from coming through while you put the pik in your mouth. This slide button should have been located on the side or top of the wand as it&#x27;s awkward to slide to the off position and keep the pik pointed in the sink so you don&#x27;t squirt down your walls. My old one  just had a push button and not a slide button to accomplish this task. Why Waterpik changed this design is baffling.</li>
    <li> A ridiculous product. It looks and feels cheap. Do not let the product picture here fool you. This thing is cheap, noisy and absolutely ineffective. When I say noisy, I mean REALLY noisy. &amp;#34;do not use it anywhere in the vicinity of a room where you have sleeping babies noisy&amp;#34;...&lt;br /&gt;And when I say ineffective, I mean eat something... brush really well... use it for quite some time and be methodical and thorough ... and then floss and be amazed of the amount of food that is still in between your teeth.</li>
    <li> As far as making my teeth feel amazing, this gets a sold 5 stars. Especially getting around my adult brathes. My one piece of feed back is just this, the slide button that initiates water flow is horribly tight and tough to turn on. I am 6&#x27;3&amp;#34; 225 pounds and Olympic lifting is my hobby, my thumbs aren&#x27;t weak and this thing is almost impossible to turn on. There has to be a better way to get this thing going. I can&#x27;t even imagine a child trying to turn it on.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive gums so flossing was always painful.  This waterpik is a fantastic!  I just wish I would have purchased it sooner!  So far it is doing everything thing as described.  Its really gentle on the gums and does a great job at getting all the food particles out.  I&#x27;m looking forward to the next dental checkup to see if the waterpik is really doing its job.  I have a large family so it will get used frequently.  I just  hope it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Good，I like it and use it every day!</li>
    <li> Bought this for a friend and she can&#x27;t stop thanking me for it</li>
    <li> water reservoir is not big enuff.  my other water flosser was perfect.  too bad the hose broke.  need to improve on the size of the tank.. plus, i don&#x27;t think it does as good of a job las my old one.  Even when i fill the tank and use it twice.  Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> So far it works very well. I have only had it a short time and used it 3 or 4 times.</li>
    <li> Meet all my expectations, very powerful and useful. Works ok in EU by using a 220V to 110V convertor, you can make a 220V model for Europe</li>
    <li> The device is pleasant to use and my mouth and gums feel fresh after use. I certainly hope it is effective butbwho&#x27;s to know?</li>
    <li> Love it.  A bit noisy but I put a small towel under it.  Choice of brushes and tips is great as I have gum issues.  A plus is the skip that indicates quadrant change.  Would highly recommend.  Have found nothing to dislike about this Waterpik WP660</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK.  Not the best built, I got it when I got braces.  Not great, just fair.</li>
    <li> Really like using it even though  the water makes  a terrible mess on my mirror.</li>
    <li> I just had to have braces to save some of my teeth and this product was recommended by a friend who had gone through braces later in life as well. Braces catch all kinds of food and it is important yet harder to clean the teeth and all the brace structure and this water flosser helps much.</li>
    <li> The waterpik works well except that the on-off button on the hand piece is so stiff and difficult to move that I need to use BOTH hands. This is extremely frustrating because I inevitably spray water all over myself and the bathroom sink. I thought it would get easier to manipulate the switch after a few weeks. I have been using it for about 3 months and it is still stiff.</li>
    <li> I have dental problems.  But, enough about me.  I&#x27;ve had several water flossers in the past.  Some stand-alone, some you attach to your bathroom sink.  Nothing has worked as well as this particular model (including other waterpiks).  It also has a very small footprint which is important since I don&#x27;t have a lot of counter space.  The variable settings offer enough of a variety when it comes to pressure.  The on/off switch on the hand piece is also a nice touch (as opposed to one on the base only).  I&#x27;m also a huge fan of the periodontal tip.  It&#x27;s tiny and can effectively clean just about any small or hard to reach spot.</li>
    <li> I use the Water Pik every day.  Very effective in cleaning teeth and gums and I have received great reports from my orthodontist and dentist.  I wish I had purchased one years ago.</li>
    <li> Works great. A little noisy and you have to get use to the feel but great once you have.</li>
    <li> Great product. I hate dental floss as it is hard for my large hands to grip. This is a great, if not better alternative. Saves me time as well. Would purchase again or give as gift to family.</li>
    <li> works well but wear a raincoat when you use it because it will soak your neck, arms and chest. but it does a good job of removing lodged in food remnants from your teeth and massages your gums. good item.</li>
    <li> For all those out there who are fans of this type of product, this one is the best.</li>
    <li> I bought this water flosser in February and today the motor died ... just a month after return possible date.&lt;br /&gt;Used it daily and thought it was a good purchase but not so.  Would have thought for the price it would have lasted and worked much longer. Really disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have used this brand pik for many years and this newest model is the best yet. Cleans and removes food really well and no bad breath anymore.</li>
    <li> ON/OFF switch attached to handle almost impossible to operate. I had to force it on, then leave it that way and turn the unit on or off at the base. Other than that it works very well.</li>
    <li> I wish I&#x27;d bought one of these years ago. It&#x27;s simple, easy to use and and effective, cleaning areas that neither a brush nor floss will reach.</li>
    <li> For serious mouth care this Water Flosser is pretty good for removing food particles between my teeth. Sometimes I have to result to flossing with the string floss but not usually. I replaced an earlier version with this model and find this newer one better because it has a larger reservoir and a better design.</li>
    <li> Sure does beat dental floss.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product, it has 10 settings for water pressure as well as multiple attachments. The water pressure can be set low enough to use attachments such as the tongue cleaner, or high enough to dislodge items stuck between teeth. For those who use dental floss, you each know how difficult it can be to reach the back teeth, with the WP-660 it&#x27;s very easy and doesn&#x27;t tend to cause a gag reflex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While some products don&#x27;t stand up to the test of, &amp;#34;would I buy it now, knowing what I know&amp;#34;, this is a product I would certainly buy. In fact this is one of the few products I would easily recommend to others. While I understand this is not an alternative to brushing, it is an excellent addition to it. Which brings me to another point regarding this product, one of the attachments that is included is a small toothbrush.</li>
    <li> THIS WAS PURCHASED FOR MY HUSBAND TO REPLACE HIS BROKEN WATER FLOSSER (BROKEN ONE NOT MADE ANY MORE) HE HAS HAD WATERPIK BEFORE AND I ALSO HAVE ONE I ORDERED SOME TIME BACK FROM AMAZON THIS IS JUST A NEWER MODEL. MY HUSBAND IS REALLY SOMETHING WHEN IT COMES TO WATER FLOSSING HIS TEETH SO WHEN HE SAYS A PRODUCT IS GOOD I KNOW IT IS GREAT.</li>
    <li> fantastic...had my wisdom teeth pulled at the age of 30, and used it to keep the gaping holes cleaned lol....eeeewwwww..  works incredibly well, and fell in love with it, cause it cleans plaque like crazy...love love love it. my mouth feels amazing!  anytime i feel a gross plaque build up, i can now BLAST it away to perfect ssssmmmoooooothness.  only had it for a few months though...love it</li>
    <li> Really like this flosser. Very easy to use.  Bought it for the kids and they also really like it.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at all the loose bits it removed even after good brushing and flossing. It is easy to use and now something we will always have.  The pressure is easily changed on the dial, it comes with an assortment of tips and is well built,.</li>
    <li> No complaints works like it should.  Love the ability to govern the power of the water stream from almost no pressure to put out a house fire.</li>
    <li> Many non-flossers have written about the benefits of Waterpik water flossing, but I rarely hear about flossers who also use the Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a long-term, dedicated flosser with periodontal problems. I&#x27;d been brushing with a Sonicare twice a day and flossing with traditional floss at least once per day, but just was not able to get my dental trouble under control. Out of desperation, I bought the Waterpik Water Flosser and added it to my daily routine. Note: I said &#x27;added&#x27;. So, now I brush twice per day, floss with regular floss at least once per day, and use the Waterpik once or twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a difference the Waterpik routine has made! I noted a difference within the first twenty-four hours. Now, one week into my new routine, I can say I am dedicated to Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fully expect to have my dental hygenist declare, on my new visit, that I no longer need deep cleanings.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday. I have a lot of dental work and I needed to get into places floss just doesn&#x27;t get. I love it. Even my dentist commented on how clean my mouth looked.</li>
    <li> I had one of these years ago but this modern model is a great improvement.  My dentist recommended it, and I&#x27;m glad he did.  It&#x27;s easy to use and really gets the job done.  The water jets actually floss between the teeth better than string in my opinion.  My teeth have never felt so clean, and the gum massage is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!! Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very good item thank you very much</li>
    <li> perfect,i like it very much,i feel my tooth very clean ,and don&#x27;t got tooth problem anymore.</li>
    <li> This item is amazing&lt;br /&gt;Noticed a huge difference in a week&lt;br /&gt;My gums feel great</li>
    <li> the material is not as sturdy as my old one but it does the job</li>
    <li> Works great should have gotten one years ago. I highly recommend this unit!</li>
    <li> the product is similar to other water jets system. But has uneven pressure during use.the tip location is hard to use</li>
    <li> Thus far my Waterpik has met my expectations.  The pressure is adjustable to ones liking and the water basin is large enough.</li>
    <li> Not as effective, useful our user friendly as expected. Works well though. Teeth definitely feel clean.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended it.</li>
    <li> Performs as advertised. Good quality and feel teeth and gums are cleaned well though this method of &amp;#34;flossing.&amp;#34; Would like to have quieter motor.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use and the variable speeds is nice .  It does use water fast when it is one the higher speed which stand to reason.  I love it so much better than dental floss and in my opinion does a better job with less pain and lot cleaner.</li>
    <li> Cleans between teeth better than floss or toothpick</li>
    <li> Hate it. This waterpik is so loud!&lt;br /&gt;Nobody could sleep through all this noise. You would think in this day and age a quiet waterpik could be designed.&lt;br /&gt;Refund my money.</li>
    <li> Works well and happy with the way my gums feel now!</li>
    <li> This is my second one and I love the ways it makes my mouth feel after I use it.  I love water flossing my mouth</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.. Very satisfied</li>
    <li> I was happy with the Ultra model but it stopped working after only one year. Thought I would use this opportunity to upgrade to this one. Unfortunately this unit did not work properly when it would only pulse at a rate of around 100 cycles per minute regardless of the dial setting and shut off after about 20 seconds. I arranged to have it replaced with another one which also did not pulse properly. This lead me to conclude that these must be coming from a bad lot and a third round would not help so I threw in the towel and arranged for a refund. Have to wonder if Waterpik needs to look at their QC procedures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kudos to Amazon for arranging both the delivery of the replacement and pick up of the first unit within 24 hours.</li>
    <li> Compact and efficient waterpik to clean teeth, especially hard to reach surfaces.</li>
    <li> Love this.  Wished I had gotten this long ago, as I have big spaces between my teeth.</li>
    <li> Really cleans your gums.My dentist was amazed how well my gums looked after using this for 3 months.</li>
    <li> I have never been a person the flosses on a regular basis and heard about it everytime I went to the dentist.  Bought this water pik and the dentist was able to notice the difference.  I can&#x27;t say it is as good as actual floss but it does keep your teeth cleaner</li>
    <li> This is a great water flosser. It is easy to use and very efficient.</li>
    <li> Man oh man, the best waterpik yet. My 12th year of using these amazing machines.</li>
    <li> I love my waterpik!  I had some major dental work done and needed more assistance with flossing.  This has been a great addition to my dental routine.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot because it is holding itself.  Most Waterpik don&#x27;t last long.  There&#x27;s one thing I would change if I was the manufacturer, is to reduce the noise when in use.</li>
    <li> My teeth have never felt so clean!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not too big, it has a good size!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and effective.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it. She absolutely hated flossing. This is easier and leaves your mouth cleaner than you&#x27;d think you could get it. Never going without again.</li>
    <li> Wow! I havent used a waterpik in years and I have to say that they have come a long way from when they first started. This motor noise is compared to the older models and they seemed to have worked out the the correct pulsing of the water. My gums bled the first time but have not bled since, my gums feel better and it seems to be working after just 3 uses.&lt;br /&gt;The unit is small compared to the older models and really doesnt take up much space no problem re-coiling the wand back into the unit and it it very easy to use. The switch on the wand is a bit hard to turn off and on  you really need to have your finger in the correct spot in order to use it this is my only complaint.&lt;br /&gt;I have not used the ULTRA so I cant compare the 2 but this model seems well built and works just fine!</li>
    <li> I bought this product last year and continue to use it most nights.  My teeth feel so fresh and clean after I use it.  It is easy to use.</li>
    <li> We really like the Waterpik Its surprising how much junk it cleans out even after brushing.</li>
    <li> excellent water pic. Glad I got it !</li>
    <li> Gets all of the food between my teeth that a toothbrush misses. Makes for healthy gums.</li>
    <li> Works great, my whole family uses it. We all use different tips of course. :-)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quality is poor. Now it stop work only 2 months</li>
    <li> It perfect for my needs.</li>
    <li> I got braces recently and this makes cleaning 10x easier. The nice thing about this item is that you can regulate the pressure and it has a large tank so you don&#x27;t have to keep refilling.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping, thanks</li>
    <li> It works really well and I like all the tips, but it is a little noisy.  I have to put it on top of a cloth to buffer the noise at night if my partner is sleeping.  Still does the job though.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. I&#x27;m only a few days into using it, but all is well and my teeth feel cleaner than usual.</li>
    <li> Performs as advertised. My teeth feel really clean and it&#x27;s nice not to have to floss. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> You have to get used to being careful not to spray yourself, but it works well.</li>
    <li> I was never taught to floss as a child. I was reminded to but I never did. Once I started, I realized how great it was to clear out all the particles, but string flossing is still extremely cumbersome. Enter the Waterpik. I would argue that this is superior to flossing and even supplements brushing. Gums are healthier, teeth cleaner, and I&#x27;m just happy overall with this purchase.  The unit itself is loud with the motor on but I could care less.  The reservoir is easy to fill and it comes with plenty of accessories.  I set mine on top of a cork pad to absorb some of the vibration.</li>
    <li> It takes up space on my kitchen counter (the only place I have water, electricity, and a water drain).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it works fine, much better than the cordless models I had before.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what my dentist requested.  It is easy to use and not as noisy as my previous waterpik.</li>
    <li> I had a difficult time using the off/on switch on the handle.  It was almost impossible for me to move.  Amazon sent me a replacement and it was even worse.  I did like the unit itself and maybe over time the switch would loosened up, but in the meantime it was almost impossible for me to use, so I returned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the switch, I was satisfied with the unit.</li>
    <li> This water pik is my second one in my life time - I am 71.  I like how easy it is to use and the water cup holds more water so I do not run out before I finish my water flossing.</li>
    <li> Great way to floss. The water tank should&#x27;ve been larger. I have to rush through my teeth to avoid a refill.</li>
    <li> I have had some oral issues and this thing is awesome!!! I have had a few skin grafts in my mouth and this will get places where floss just doesn&#x27;t. Fantastic! If you have any periodontal issues, buy one!</li>
    <li> I like the results that I get from using this product.  My teeth are cleaner and I feel it is very healthy for my gums.</li>
    <li> I don;t know how I lived this long without a water pic. This is a really good one. It&#x27;s clunky but if you don&#x27;t need to travel with it it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> My first experience with a water pic so I&#x27;m unable to compare it to others. Problem 1) is the inadequate documentation. It seems to be written with an experienced user in mind. Yes, much is obvious but still.... 2) Due to 1) I wasn&#x27;t really sure of how it was supposed to turn on/off. The slider was so stiff I was afraid I&#x27;d break it. (An experienced user told me it would, and it did. But in the interim I was starting/stopping water flow with the line-in ON/OFF switch, not a good practice with any electrical device, especially not a 110 VAC device in a bathroom. Even now that I know where the slider is I find it slippery and hard to use. I think a simple push-on/push-off would be better. 3) Yes, several tips were supplied but I could have used some details on the intended purpose of each.</li>
    <li> Settings and water pressure is good. The waterpik came with 6 attachments which is nice, however the storage compartment only holds 2. The handle at times does not sit well in it&#x27;s holder.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully, just like at the dentist. Also works great to keep dog/small child at bay when they&#x27;re screaming for attention.</li>
    <li> What a difference from my old Waterpik!  It&#x27;s quieter, looks nicer, takes up less counter space, and the stream is simple to adjust.  The reservoir is easier to situate correctly, and the controls are placed for easier on/off.  No minuses at all.</li>
    <li> The water pic arrived well packaged and fully intact and complete. The flosser was everything the advertising promised and more. Am looking forward to years of clean teeth and healthy gums.</li>
    <li> Convenient, effective and simple. Does an excellent job as a water flosser, and extremely easy to use right out of the box.</li>
    <li> Works well. Great for irrigation, does it actually power off plaque? Not quite a believer in that at this point but I have not turned up power all the way yet either. Mouth feels quite refreshed and cleaner after using so even if not quite the plaque remover, it is well worth the money. As far as the splashing goes, it is shooting water out of a nozzle, what else would you expect? There is some splashing, but it is manageable.</li>
    <li> We love this water pick, works as expected and it&#x27;s really fun to use it compare to just the thread floss! Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> First one and it is doing a great job. Perhaps to good of a job... Now I need to go to the dentist to get me teeth cleaned. See stuff that shouldn&#x27;t be there &amp;#34;Tarter&amp;#34; in  the last year. Should have bought one of these a long time ago.</li>
    <li> I have used older versions of WaterPik and while they worked, I have never been impressed. They were always a necessity. This one has finally met my expectations and exceeded. It delivers just as strong a pulse of water as older versions but with far less water. The massager mode is really nice. This version has a switch to turn on and off water flow on the handle, which is a huge improvement because older styles required you to constantly hold a button to stop water flow or have water fly everywhere. The tips have vastly improved and do a much better job cleaning between teeth, in my periodontal pockets and under my crowns.</li>
    <li> Works perfect. I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> A good water flosser.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery works fine.</li>
    <li> My husband purchased this because he hates to floss and he now uses this EVERY DAY! He loves it!&lt;br /&gt;It is a little noisy so sometimes it startles me if I&#x27;m still asleep!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and works great. Highly pleased.</li>
    <li> Best water pick I have used</li>
    <li> My teeth and gum feels really clean.  The only thing against it is that it IS messy.  I use this in the shower, so I don&#x27;t get all messy and wet.  Also, the on/off button on the handle is hard to push and the button to change mode is hard to press.  Other than that It is a great cleaning tool.</li>
    <li> water everywhere at first but after watching a video on how to position myself, bending over into the sink, it became easier to use and less of a wet mess. now use it twice a day.</li>
    <li> Works good and has a lot of range in the pressure adjustment, only down side is the on/off switch on the handle is hard to move, might be a little tough for girls and old folks.</li>
    <li> This thing is pretty powerful! Teeth and gums feel great after use. I took off one star because it is quite loud. Would be good to an automatic cutoff when the water level runs out.</li>
    <li> Small enough to fit in a small bathroom, works great.</li>
    <li> I use this every day as I have crowns and bridges.  It does not replace brushing or flossing...just an added assurance that my teeth have the best chance of surviving cavities.  One other review said the water line was difficult to put back on the machine, but I have not found that to be the case at all.</li>
    <li> This product is flawed.  It is almost impossible to turn the unit on or off from the handheld wand since the switch is so hard to operate.  I am very disappointed since I expected a quality product with a Waterpik logo</li>
    <li> It arrived in one day and is everything it declared to be</li>
    <li> It is hard to turn on</li>
    <li> I used this product as soon as it arrived and wow !!. My mouth felt so clean as if I just came from my dentist for my regular cleaning. I love it and recommend everyone to get one.</li>
    <li> the waterpik is a marvelous teeth cleaning tool</li>
    <li> It works but is messy.</li>
    <li> This is a very good healthy product.  A must have.  I gave it 3 stars because its SO LOUD!</li>
    <li> Best machine ever!  I have several crowns and it gently removes any hidden food particles.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product and so is my hygienist after my last cleaning :-)</li>
    <li> after filling the tank, the flosser runs initially with a strong distaste of plastic chemicals.</li>
    <li> I love my Waterpik Aquarius.  Only complaint is the on-off switch on the wand is too hard to turn on and off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 72 and still have good strength in my hands, but anyone not having strength in their hands may find the unit to hard to use.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- It does the job of cleaning between teeth very well.&lt;br /&gt;- Looks great on the bathroom counter. (I know looks shouldn&#x27;t be so important... But if it doesn&#x27;t look good - you probably will try to hide it from view.) This thing can sit there and be drooled-over by your guests. (hopefully not drooled-on).&lt;br /&gt;- Much easier than flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Only when compared to the WaterPik Ultra do we see flaws; 1- more expensive 2- the extra features are more razzle-dazzle but not really needed. 3- it&#x27;s lighter and narrower than the Ultra and so it feels more top-heavy. Not a good thing if you happen to knock it over.&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s water reservoir does not hold enough water to clean my whole mouth in one go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What works for me: I mix a few tablespoons of Hydrogen Peroxide for extra-cleaning power.  But don&#x27;t do this if you can&#x27;t keep the water from getting into your throat (it takes lots of practice).</li>
    <li> I purchased a water flosser because everyone I know swears by it.  Of course, it is easier just to get piece of dental floss and have at it.  I had high expectations when I purchased this product but only got so-so results.  First of all, you get 6 different tools/heads to use with the apparatus that are good for general use or for more advanced dental issues. The drawback is that the storage unit is under the water reservoir lid and only holds 2 tools.  Set up is easy.  Before first use, the instructions advise to flush some of the water in the sink.  When I did this some black debris came out so don&#x27;t skip this step!  After first use it was a complete disaster.  Water was dripping out to the base of the hand unit and also the reservoir.  I made sure everything was inserted properly and it was.  I am not sure if some of the debris was still stuck somewhere but the unit eventually stopped leaking and all was fine.  I used the toothbrush tip and the orthodontic tip my mouth felt clean.  I admit my mouth feels better after a good flossing.  A huge drawback to this unit is that it is a lot noisier than I suspected.  I will think I will still use this on occasion but I will keep flossing with good old-fashioned string as part of my normal routine.</li>
    <li> Works as expected, arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> Beautiful up grade for one I have been using every day for years</li>
    <li> I used to dread the quarterly visits to my periodontist...I had several 6mm pockets around my rear molars.  Since I started using a water-pik regularly, the pockets have shrunk by 1-2mm and the good doctor is no longer grousing at me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outside of occasionally spraying the mirror, wife and dog, a water-pik is easy to use.  You just want to be careful to start with it set to a low power and work up to something stronger.  Also, if your teeth are at all cold sensitive, use warm water.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s quite an experience.  :-)</li>
    <li> This works great with warm water and a shot of Listerine</li>
    <li> ehhh, just ok nothing more</li>
    <li> Unit did a great job no problems and maybe even too much pressure at first, takes a bit to get use to it but after that it does a great job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a dentist or dental hygienist , or even a (fluid mechanics, perhaps) physicist, so I can&#x27;t tell you whether the Waterpik WP-660 \\&quot;Professional\\&quot; Water Flosser is better than a thorough brushing followed by brushing.  However, if your dental professional recommends a WaterPik, I *can* report that I&#x27;m very happy with this model, although some of the various tips seem a little superfluous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike some reviewers here, I&#x27;ve had no problems with the truly convenient on/off switch located on the handle; the switch enables you to turn the machine on while the device is in your mouth, preventing the extra-oral spraying all over your bathroom.  Good job there!  Nor have I had any problem seating the waterpik back in its holder, or noticed any mold forming.  (They recommend cleaning with vinegar solution, oh, and YES, you can use this with mouth wash-just rinse the device afterwards.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few highlights include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. A nice continuous (it does not adjust at \\&quot;click points\\&quot;) power dial, and the very real difference in these power settings.  Depending on preferences and the health of your gums, you can very easily adjust from a very light stream to one so powerful it may hurt in certain areas.  You can even change the jet stream power while using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Adequate water supply.  The built-in tank (it&#x27;s well held in place by a thin plastic cover) holds enough water to do a thorough cleaning of all your teeth and gums.  If you sometimes want a little extra gum massage/cleaning, it&#x27;s very fast and easy to just fill up the small, light plastic tank again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Smaller footprint, semi-stylish design.  This will take up less room on a counter top (check the dimensions given by Amazon above) than Waterpiks from the past, and it&#x27;s not nearly as unwieldy looking.  While hard white plastic with an attached cleaning device sticking up (see pictures) isn&#x27;t going to enhance your bathroom&#x27;s appearance, the look is a definite improvement compared to some of the clunkers I had several years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Overall quality.  Although I&#x27;ve used this for only a couple of months, I&#x27;m impressed with the overall functioning of the Waterpik.  It&#x27;s been reliable, it has a strong motor, the timer feature (so that you can pace your cleaning) works every time, and the power is impressive.  There&#x27;s a massage feature that give you a pulse rather than a continuous flow. I didn&#x27;t see the need for this at first, but I now prefer it when my purpose is to massage the gums only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.It&#x27;s a bit noisy, but not more than I expected. However, if your bathroom (or wherever the heck you use this) is close to a bedroom where your partner sleeps, you&#x27;ll want to close all doors.  It might even be better to Waterpik when he or she is awake.  The dog seems neutral.  The tips that are placed into the handle are locked with a small twist of a circular ring.  Very easy to do, but there is a bit of vibration to the top that is mildly annoying. I say \\&quot;mildly\\&quot; because it does not seem to affect performance; on the other hand, my irritation comes from a sense that it should have a tighter fit. Just an engineering aesthetic preference, not something that should keep you from buying this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those Bells and Whistles...  Timers, LED light displays, a closed compartment for two extra tips, and five types of tips, I wonder if they really make much of a difference, especially the tips (the timer and LED work fine and seem pretty standard on dental appliances these days).  The tips though...  You get a thin hard tip to deliver water \\&quot;deep into periodontal pockets,\\&quot;  a flat one to clean your tongue, a sort of soft tiny brush tip  to brush teeth \\&quot;and all around [the] orthodontic bracket, \\&quot; a toothbrush tip (standard looking circular brush), and the bristled \\&quot;plaque-seeker\\&quot; tip (\\&quot;Gently brush along the gumline, pausing briefly between teeth to gently brush and allow the water to flow between  the teeth.\\&quot;)  [Quotes from the very thorough and easy-to-understand included manual.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of these seem not entirely effective to me. For example, using the brush with toothpaste doesn&#x27;t work that well , because the water stream volume quickly gets rid of the tooth paste. (However, the manual does state it can be used with or without paste).  The e plaque-seeker&#x27;s brush just doesn&#x27;t seem much better than the general use \\&quot;classic jet tip,\\&quot; but perhaps others will find it helpful. So far, I haven&#x27;t.  Not a big complaint, but I imagine it may add a little to the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with this new Waterpik and enjoy using it.  My mouth *feels* extra clean afteruse.  Is it cleaner than doing a thorough flossing...I don&#x27;t know.  However, you might consider whether you&#x27;ll take better care of your teeth with a well-working gadget that is easy to use and leaves a subjective feeling of CLEAN TEETH.  The gumline massage capability seems superior to flossing.  If you&#x27;re not a skeptic, consider the company&#x27;s claim that \\&quot;Flossers are clinically proven to remove up to 99.9% of plaque from treated areas in 3 seconds. And for healthier gums, they are clinically proven up to 50% more effective for improving gum health vs. string floss.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to see the price about $10 lower than the current non-discounted price, so it&#x27;s not great, but reasonably good value.  If it motivates you to clean you teeth and gums more often than before, it&#x27;s an excellent value!  : )  As always, consult your oral hygiene specialist to see whether the Waterpik is a wise choice for you.orough and easy-to-understand included manual.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of these seem not entirely effective to me.

    <li> i really like having a water pick. it is better then flaws and there&#x27;s plenty of power,use the setting #6 i used #9 and it made my teeth bleed.the only thing i don&#x27;t like about it is it doesn&#x27;t keep the water warm for my sensitive teeth so i have to fill it every time.</li>
    <li> excellent water flosser!</li>
    <li> Bulky for travel but worth it in performance.</li>
    <li> Wonderfull !! Much better than the older model</li>
    <li> That thing work great and is cutting my dental bill. That is the reason I got it in the first place. Flossing gust wasn&#x27;t getting the job done to the degree I needed cause of the way my teeth sit and also a bridge I have. Know issues any more. A great investment if you are having the issued I was having and recommend this Water pik</li>
    <li> Improves on the prior model. Timing &amp;#34;pauses&amp;#34; alerts one to time (water) left.  Even more efficient in space, size. Been using Waterpiks for years and they get better and better. Using three times a day and they last about three years.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working well for me and I hope to use all the attachments for it.</li>
    <li> I can really see and  feel the difference using this water flosser, knowing that I&#x27;ve gotten all the food particles out is fantastic!</li>
    <li> I can feel how clean my mouth is!! Great product, I love how you can choose the intensity of the water pressure, 10 is veeery intense and I would start 1-5 in the beginning! One thing that keeps it from five stars is that the on/off switch on the device can get very stuck, and that it does not include a case for the additional pics. My gums are significantly healthier after using it consistently. You can use it with water or mouthwash. When I had my wisdom teeth out I used it on a very low setting to flush the areas as they healed. Versatile and definitely more efficient than the old hand and string method we all know and hate!!</li>
    <li> Like the effect.  Turning on the wand a little difficult.</li>
    <li> This would be the 2nd water flosser that I&#x27;ve owned.  It works great.  Design reduces dust/dirt collection.  Lid is connected to unit freeing your hands when adding water or cleaning reservoir.  Cord retracts easily to original location.  Adjusts well from soft to strong stream.  Pulsates.  Can feel the clean!  I got this for me and my wife.  Now I am going to order one for my children.</li>
    <li> The switch to on the handle to turn the water on and off is one big pain to turn on and off - oftentimes it takes two hands.  The unit is very loud so if your bathroom is off your master bedroom don&#x27;t think using this if your spouse is sleeping.</li>
    <li> I really like my waterpik.  I used one in the past and decided to get another one.</li>
    <li> Overall great value. I wish it were a little heavier so that it wouldn&#x27;t feel so tipsy on the counter, and I wish there were a place to store all the tips, but, other than that it&#x27;s been a great unit for a family of four for the last few months at least. The kids floss now - happily! (And they&#x27;re 7 &amp; 10 years old)</li>
    <li> Works well but did not come with anything to hold the extra items that came with it. I was very disappointed. It seemed odd.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Shipping was fast and great service! Satisfied!!</li>
    <li> Wish it had a place for all its attachments and held more water, otherwise works well</li>
    <li> This is totally awesome. Works in place of flossing. I brush my teeth and then use my Waterpik and it&#x27;s amazing at what you see fall into the sink! Love it!</li>
    <li> Great.  Still working.</li>
    <li> faulty device , no power , the return is too expensive......:(  I do not recommend buying online without test run.</li>
    <li> Works great. Wish attachments were cheaper but may save a tooth that is in trouble.</li>
    <li> Great product, quick delivery, thanks</li>
    <li> much better design than previous model 100</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several months now and I am completely satisfied with the purchase.  A terrific product for improving your gum and overall oral health.  It&#x27;s a well built unit that looks nice too on the bathroom counter.  Plenty of power to remove stuck food particles in the teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> Has already outlived the &#x27;other brands&#x27;</li>
    <li> Quieter than the older model that this unit replaced. Slightly smaller footprint on my bathroom countertop. It works as I expected, no negative findings. Priced attractively.</li>
    <li> Works great. Had a great dental cleaning appt.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this water flosser. I put a couple caps of peroxide and a teaspoon of baking soda in the water and it does a GREAT job of cleaning and irrigating my gums.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  I cannot do without a good water flosser.  My previous finally gave up the ghost after years of good service.  This new one provides additional options that I appreciate.</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say about this thing, it does exactly what it says it will in the manner it promises. Perhaps it could be made of better materials. But then I am picking nits.</li>
    <li> Leaked water everywhere, even when turned off.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this Waterpik model.  I&#x27;ve owned other oral irrigators which I didn&#x27;t use much because the pressure was too strong for my gums, even though they had a pressure adjustment.  The Waterpik Aquarius dials down to a light comfortable pressure which feels good on my gums.  It is a smaller compact size so it doesn&#x27;t take up much space on the counter.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t operate it w/o watering the whole bathroom; must practice a lot frst to use it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a lot smaller that I imagined, and that&#x27;s a plus.  I think the price is pretty good for this.  It cleans really well, except for my front bottom teeth as they are pressed together pretty tough (it tough to get in there even with dental tape).  All in all, I like my purchase.  I enjoy using this and think anyone who cares about their teeth would gain from having one of these.</li>
    <li> great, can&#x27;t wait to see if the dentist finds improvement, my mouth, gums and teeth feel really clean.</li>
    <li> is so much more effective than flossing alone. easy to use and seems well made.</li>
    <li> REALLY GETS YOUR TEETH CLEAN ON THE SURFACE AND IN BETWEEN. NICE TO HAVE AN ASSORTMENT OF CLEANING TOOLS.  KEEPS GUMS AND TEETH HEALTHY. GOOD INVESTMENT.</li>
    <li> The water cord is shorter than I like but other than that I am mostly happy. Too early for me to tell if it really works as a floss replacement.</li>
    <li> Got this after a short circuit in the electricity burned our old model. This one is much nicer - it is smaller, prettier, and a bit less noisy. Most importantly - off with the stupid &amp;#34;mute&amp;#34; button which if u forgot pressing for a second the whole bathroom would be filled with water. now there is a proper on-off button on the hand held unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside of this one is that the place to put other tips is not too convenient to access. We alternate with it, and changing the tips now requires some more finger maneuvering than before.</li>
    <li> After going thru two cordless units in a few months each, we decided to upgrade to this monstrosity.  I really don&#x27;t want this much hardware sitting on my countertop but it seems to be a necessary evil.  It works fine.  I use the on/off button on the unit instead of the wand because I find that one hard to operate.  If you concentrate, you can coordinate so that you don&#x27;t jet water all over the bathroom.</li>
    <li> Met and exceeded my expectations.  I love that you can turn it off and on at the handle.  The strength adjustment is great.  It can go stronger than I like or weaker.  Gets everything very clean.  Perfect size.  It is a stylish elegant design.  Looks way better than my last hydrofloss machine and quieter.</li>
    <li> Very useful, my gums improved a lot.</li>
    <li> This product is Very functional and met the expectation. I am satisfied with it versatility and performance. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> you make my life complete Waterpik. I have severe OCD and this has made my routine a bit longer but my life so much fresher lol.</li>
    <li> Works great. It could even clean my mouth after I brushed my teeth.</li>
    <li> Amazing! I have braces so i use it to clean everything in between my braces and teeth. (doesn&#x27;t mean ppl should stop flossing) it helps get the food out in between my teeths but It doesn&#x27;t remove the plaque in my gums, so flossing is still recommended as well as brushing!!</li>
    <li> It does what the advertisement states. Just be careful about the number settings of the water and the motor it is a little to loud .</li>
    <li> Works great! The dentist said I needed a &amp;#34;Deep Cleaning&amp;#34; to get rid of some rough spots on my teeth, this thing got rid of them after 3 uses. I have insurance and it would have still cost me $500 for the cleaning.  Now I can just go in for a standard cleaning only $20.</li>
    <li> One of the best items I have ever bought. Works so amazing and couldn&#x27;t now go a day without it. Love it more than my Sonicare</li>
    <li> This product works very well for me!</li>
    <li> I had to disagree with some of the reviews (including one of the &amp;#34;most helpful&amp;#34; ones) which suggest that the old model is better than this one. THAT&#x27;S NOT TRUE! I listened to these reviews at the beginning a few months ago went ahead and bought the old model WP-100 only to realize that I wasted money -- the old model became unusable after a few months because the pause button was annoyingly stuck there forever and the whole machine stinks due to mold caused by its bad design. I got the new model WP-660 a few days ago and I CAN SAY that the new model is so much better!!! This new model is not only &amp;#34;better looking&amp;#34; but has so many improvements including its quality, noise control, using experience and lots more. DO NOT listen to those reviews who tell you to buy the old model, YOU WILL REGRET IT IF YOU DID SO!!! Those who say the old model &amp;#34;is better&amp;#34; I guess it&#x27;s because they are simply used to something old and don&#x27;t want to move forward, the improvements done on the WP-660 are so obvious!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product. I just had my wisdom tooth removal. There is small gap and always have food inside. When I use waterpik can always get it clean. It really help prevent cavity!!</li>
    <li> I had the WP100 for a long time, I really liked it.  I like this one much more than the WP100, the reservoir seems like it fits more precisely, it is very quiet, and it is as powerful or more than the old unit.  The handle switch is a huge improvement.</li>
    <li> I just had a bridge put in and my dentist suggested this.  I love it!!!  It feels so good!!  Also, seems to be much improved from the Waterpik I used in the past.</li>
    <li> AWESOME GADGET saved me plenty of time</li>
    <li> Not sure if the unit was defective of not but water leaked like crazy out of the handle where it met the hose and there is no way to tighten it up.  What a mess it made.  I would have paid three items the cost for something that worked, THIS DOES NOT!</li>
    <li> I really like the idea of this product but the one I received is  difficult to use.  The on off switch on the handle is almost impossible to move.  I am hoping that eventually it will get easier to move but for now thid makes it a bit messy to use.  If the on off switch worked properly I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Awesome, feel better and more fun than flossing.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I never got to use this product. My parents had one and I loved it so much when I came to visit I bought one for myself. When I tried using it at home, it never even turned on. By the time I got around to doing something about it, the return policy had run out (30 days). I am pretty disappointed.</li>
    <li> We have only had this Waterpik for two days but I love it so far. I am hoping that this will help improve our family&#x27;s dental health especially the &amp;#34;pockets&amp;#34; the dentist found. I have never used one of these before. I was surprised and pleased at how good it felt and how clean my teeth felt after two uses. I brush my teeth with an electric toothbrush and always use string floss but this is even better! It is fairly easy to use and the instructions are good. I&#x27;m glad the instructions suggested lukewarm water. You just fill the reservoir, turn it on, select Floss or Massage, and use it. The literature says it will floss deep below the gums where string floss won&#x27;t reach and it seems to do that. It guarantees healthier gums in 14 days. Hope that is true! I&#x27;ll update after using this for a while.</li>
    <li> Best product ever used for my gums!</li>
    <li> Works very well, but I don&#x27;t think it delivers the pressure that my old, now non-working one did. Still, it does a better job than flossing string.</li>
    <li> This is incredible and so easy to use! My mouth, teeth and gums feel and look sparkling! For me much better than flossing and it works!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the sliding pause button on the handle.  It is very difficult to work and results in spraying water everywhere by the time you get it paused.  May as well hit the power button on the main unit</li>
    <li> Good size for small spaces, we don&#x27;t have a lot of room and I was concerned when ordering it. I was pleasantly surprised - clean and petite design It works great a bit noisy but I don&#x27;t have prior reference using another water floser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the following for my cousin. She is also loving it. However it cost a little more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H28S5GE?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;camp&#x3D;213733&amp;creative&#x3D;393185&amp;creativeASIN&#x3D;B00H28S5GE&amp;linkCode&#x3D;shr&amp;tag&#x3D;justckem-20</li>
    <li> great product nice improvements over my old one</li>
    <li> These are clinically proven to remove 99.9% of plaque from treated areas within 3 seconds of application, improve gum health and reverse gingivitis. I researched it abd shows that it has also been lab tested that if a consumer uses the Waterpick flosser regulary, they will notice healthy gums in just 14 days – guaranteed..&lt;br /&gt;Wish you a luck guys it has been satisfying my needs</li>
    <li> A little messy to use, but my teeth feel much better afterwards.My sometimes sore gums seem better too. I&#x27;ll have my next teeth cleaning in a few months and I&#x27;ll repost when I find out how well it does versus flossing.</li>
    <li> recieved it next day and we are happy with pik</li>
    <li> Great product! Does the job of floshing without having to stick two fingers in your mouth.</li>
    <li> Easy to set up, easy to use and highly effective.  If you have problems with periodontal disease, you have to get one of these. I use it twice daily with a dilute solution of Listerine, and it has made a big difference.</li>
    <li> Takes some getting used to, but once you are, it works great.</li>
    <li> Product is well made.  Powerful jets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But &amp;#34;floss&amp;#34; function stopped working within 2 weeks.....so 1 star for that.  BUT Amazon customer service sent me a new replacement FOC....that&#x27;s 6 stars for Amazon!!  As I am overseas, they did not insist on returning the damaged one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon!!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Clean bill of health from my dentist.</li>
    <li> I like it，but pressure is not enough</li>
    <li> Just the ticket for my teenage son!  Easy to work and works well!</li>
    <li> Works.  Seems well made.  I&#x27;ve only had it for a month or so and no problem so far.</li>
    <li> Just got this.  Nice size and very compact.  I am looking forward to the gum massaging.  I wore out my last model.</li>
    <li> Great item. Quick delivery</li>
    <li> I am very happy with it,will know more once denist loops at th pockets iny gums.</li>
    <li> Thumb on off slide is hard to use.</li>
    <li> For about a year now, I&#x27;ve used the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser and loved the unit.  It got my teeth clean, was simple to use, and made dentist visits much more bearable knowing I didn&#x27;t huge pockets in my gums anymore.  Recently I got the opportunity to try out the Waterpik Aquarius Water Flosser.  The upgrades to the unit, while few, are quite nice to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the huge cover that stored all the Waterpik pieces is finally gone.  I hated having all the pieces in the lid of the Ultra Water Flosser.  In the Aquarius, you can store your two favorite pieces in a space between the reservoir and the plastic side.  All the additional pieces I placed in a drawer.  This helped make the unit much more visually appealing and I no longer have to worry about pieces falling out of the lid every time I open the reservoir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another update is that there is a pulse that helps time you so you move from places to place in your mouth.  The water pulse goes off at the 30 and 60 second time.  This pulse didn&#x27;t really help much for me as I tend to move the pik through my mouth slowly anyways.  It was interesting to use the new &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; feature where the water pulses continually.  The pulsing may be more appealing to others, as I didn&#x27;t find it very useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final upgrade on the Aquarius unit is the &amp;#34;on/off&amp;#34; switch on the handle of the Waterpik.  This was another great addition to the pik.  On the Ultra Water you would have to push and hold down a button to keep water from squirting all over the place.  Because the water is now switched, I can now turn on the unit without having to get squirted should I forget to hold down the button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the difference between the Aquarius and Ultra Water are few, but appreciated.  Both units do a fantastic job at getting your mouth super clean - it&#x27;s like having a dentist clean all the time!  I use the Waterpik everyday and can&#x27;t recommend it enough to family and friends.  It&#x27;s a great tool if you don&#x27;t like to floss and will help maintain good teeth health.  Highly recommended.great tool if you don&#x27;t like to floss and will help maintain good teeth health.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Would have given 5 stars but it is really annoying that the on/off slide button which controls the water flow on the hand piece is super STIFF. I have to use 2 hands to slide the button, which usually ends up with water shooting everywhere! Stupid design!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and as effective as promised.</li>
    <li> Outstanding appliance.  I wish I had found this years ago. I brush carefully and well and this appliance still gets otherwise trapped food particles out.  Worth the investment and makes your mouth feel GREAT.</li>
    <li> This product is very effective. No more struggling to get traditional floss around my fingers and into my mouth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, tell me. Am I the only one who pressure washed the bathroom wall with their first use? (This can be messy)</li>
    <li> I personally did not like this water pick as it is very messy to use and launches water in all directions. This could be because of operator error, but even with the pressure turned all the way down, it did not help.  It did do the job its intended to do, but I feel flossing still does a better job.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these. One for me and another for my girlfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;I started using my religiously and had my dental 6 month cleaning recently and he noticed the difference here. Just by a simple device flushing water at a pulse.&lt;br /&gt;Very quick and effective. Takes approx 2 minutes&lt;br /&gt;30 seconds in there is a noticeable difference in pressure to indicate move to next quarter of the teeth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Pretty loud. Recommend you don&#x27;t switch this on late at night or early in morning when partner is asleep. Unless you like getting into trouble ;p</li>
    <li> The unit is compact and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space. I like this better than string flossing, but I seem to get water all over the sink. Perhaps my technique will improve over time. :-)</li>
    <li> We got this for our daughter who does not like to floss.  it works great - no issues.  Easy to set up and use right out of the box.</li>
    <li> i love this thing. no doubt its a bit messy (at least the way i do it).</li>
    <li> my teeth feel so clean after 1st use! It&#x27;s very useful when you feel you need to clean your teeth...I add some listerin in there and it makes me feel clean. The water is strong enough when you change it to 6. I&#x27;ve never tried the massage feature yet, the only thing is that when i use it the water splashes everywhere, I have to almost put my face in the sink so it won&#x27;t get on the counter.</li>
    <li> No water pressure and just too noisy.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended it , so far I am pleased,, Will see on my next dental appt.</li>
    <li> A great way to floss your teeth!  After two weeks of use, I went to the dental hygienist and she was amazed at the improvement in my dental health!  It is most useful if you have difficulty flossing using floss.  I highly recommend the Waterpik Aquarius Water Flosser!</li>
    <li> great machine, works as advertised</li>
    <li> Awesome product works very well and looks like a quality product not chinsey</li>
    <li> It works as well as everyone says, but it&#x27;s VERY loud. My roommates hate it.</li>
    <li> My wife and I have been using Waterpiks for years now along with Sonicare toothbrushes. We have the previous generation Waterpik Ultra so that is what this model will be compared to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main upgrade on the Aquarius is the on/off switch on the handle. This is a huge bonus, as the previous model had a &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; button that would shoot water all over the bathroom if let go by accident. You eventually got used to always pointing the tip towards the sink, but this was my main complaint about the old model. With the new Aquarius, the on/off switch prevents this problem and is a huge bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new Aquarius model is also much better looking, although I really don&#x27;t care about the design, since when it is not in use, it is stored inside my cabinet. As far as features and power goes, there is no difference to me. The massage mode is a gimmick and I cannot feel any difference in the &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; of the water between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have noted, yes this unit is significantly lighter in weight, which does cause the unit to move around more when using the handle, especially when almost empty of water. I think Waterpik should have increased the weight and stability of the base unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new Aquarius is much more quiet, but does that justify an upgrade? hardly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Verdict: If you can find the previous model at a discounted price, buy it. Just be sure to get used to the &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; button and avoid shooting water all over your bathroom. If you already have the previous model.... Don&#x27;t bother upgrading until your unit needs to be replaced.  If you need to buy your first Waterpik and this is the only model available, then go for it. We really like the on/off switch on the handle. We&#x27;ve had our Ultra model for over 2 years now and it has functioned flawlessly, so I expect the same with this new model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: My wife and I use warm water with a capful of hydrogen peroxide. It doesn&#x27;t taste thatbad, but works wonders to kill bacteria, whitens teeth, and disinfects the unit all at once. Just don&#x27;t swallow the peroxide. Yes it&#x27;s safe and was recommended to us by our dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Excellent model, we love it! It cleans so nice between teeth and around gums!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Waterpik products for a lot of years.  I find they are a great way to keep my gums healthy.  In particular I like to use the Waterpik to shoot dilute solutions of saltwater or water + apple cider vinegar (every now and then) between my teeth where a toothbrush can&#x27;t reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for daily use just plain water is good.  My favorite attachment is the bristle brush because I can shoot water between my tight teeth while brushing them at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combine traditional floss with this Waterpik and an Oral-B Professional Deep Sweep and you have a powerful dental care combo.</li>
    <li> This Waterpik is similar to other Waterpik/oral irrigators/water flossers I&#x27;ve used in the past. It is most useful for irrigating damaged tissue due to oral surgery. Because that is a small niche, these devices have been rebranded as water flossers. I can see a use for it as a clean up after doing actual flossing, but there&#x27;s no way that water flossing with this device is comparable to actually using a piece of floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, using this device does leave your mouth feeling a bit cleaner. What I do not care for is the way that as soon as you start the machine, water starts pumping through it. There is a regulator on the applicator, but the design seems backwards--it should default to not allowing water to pass through and make you press it in order to allow water to pass through. As it is, you&#x27;ll be squirting water places you might not like to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a perfectly fine device, but if you are after clean teeth and healthy gums, I would get a Panasonic electric toothbrush and stick to flossing by hand. However, if this is the coup de grace of your oral hygiene routine, you&#x27;ll find it works well to flush away any detritus and leave your mouth feeling even cleaner and fresher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended with caveats.</li>
    <li> While I do not use the Waterpik every day, it is a nice complement to daily brushing/flossing. The pressure is adjustable and it is nicer looking than the old beige &amp;#34;pik&amp;#34; pf the past. Easy to use, and great for those with braces, gets the gunk out!</li>
    <li> Wish I hadn&#x27;t bought this. My dentist told me to stop using it as it was doing damage to my gums.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik WP-660 does a fine job...not sure what makes it &amp;#34;professional,&amp;#34; however--seems like the older models with a few more bells and whistles. Some of these added features are silly, like the massager. Really? It doesn&#x27;t do much of anything, and unless you love to play with your teeth for great lengths of time, don&#x27;t see any real purpose of it. That said, it does its job well.</li>
    <li> small compact quiet effective</li>
    <li> This really gets between my teeth and around the gum line.  Much easier to use than floss and interdental brushes.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Excellent!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the following for my cousin. She is also loving it. However it cost a little more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H28S5GE?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;camp&#x3D;213733&amp;creative&#x3D;393185&amp;creativeASIN&#x3D;B00H28S5GE&amp;linkCode&#x3D;shr&amp;tag&#x3D;nealo10a-20&amp;linkId&#x3D;DAXXNIKV47HKW23E&amp;sc&#x3D;1</li>
    <li> Works great glad I got it. Some reviews said it was hard to hang the wand back up but I have not had a problem the hose coils back up and fits great</li>
    <li> Good item,good price,good service!</li>
    <li> Refreshing to the mouth. Will leave it to the hygienists to determine how effective it is.</li>
    <li> Works great. Sure beats dental floss.</li>
    <li> Better than I thought it would be. I always sort of hating flossing, but with this I actually look forward to using it, and use it morning and night. I&#x27;ve also been known to dump more water in to make it last longer. I just use tap water, and the basic pic without bristles and whatever. It does have sort of a loud, industrial quality when it&#x27;s running, and while it&#x27;s not very sophisticated it doessn&#x27;t really bother me. It&#x27;s actually fun to use - we&#x27;ll see what my dental hygienist says at the end of the month. I also use a SoniCare toothbrush (on her recommendation).</li>
    <li> Sometimes when I&#x27;m ready for bed and don&#x27;t feel like flossing, the water pic does it for you in a flash. Love it! My husband loves it also.</li>
    <li> This is easy to use and does the trick. Cleans the plaque off and makes my mouth, along with brushing, feel clean</li>
    <li> This works great and my gums are getting better. The water flosser is more effective than string flossers that can damage your gum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not know how it compares to its older version, but this looks and works great. I like the switch on the handles which gives you better control over the process and helps minimize possible messes.</li>
    <li> Although my other Waterpik unit still works great after 7 years, I decided to purchase the WP-660 as a guest bathroom unit. Since everyone in our family uses Waterpics, they just bring their own attachments with them. As with every waterpik product that I have owned, this one works very well. It comes with all the usual attachments and has a new feature called &amp;#34;Floss&amp;#34;. This seems to reallly help with hard to get to areas. If you are a past or present Waterpik user you will not be disappointed with this new model.</li>
    <li> Really wonderful.  Better than expected.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Does a wonderful job of cleaning around the gum area.</li>
    <li> Kids and adults love this.  They use it daily.</li>
    <li> Does the job.  Pretty compact.  Definitely notice a difference vs. regular flossing.  Breath is still fresh in the morning whereas it was not when just flossing so I believe this cleans much better.  I enjoy flossing now, even though it takes twice as long...  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I recently got braces and this was recommended by my orthodontist.  It is wonderful.  It is so hard to get food out of braces but this really does the trick.  I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as advertised.  A very good product.</li>
    <li> Smaller unit than I had before and has all the features.  It was also half the price.  Waterpik quality - gets the job done!</li>
    <li> it is really in work.</li>
    <li> Works well but there is a minor problem with the power button not working with each press.</li>
    <li> works good.  no problems, a good price</li>
    <li> Replaced my older WaterPik which I really liked, with this new one and it is even better. I have had it for a month and the new extra options are worth the small price difference. I&#x27;ve recommended this to my other family members and friends who also use a water flosser with no reservations. One filled water tank does all my teeth (uppers, lowers, back and front). The variable pressure control has a great band width and the variety of tips are great.</li>
    <li> My hygienist is in agreement with my choice of healthy cleaning habits. The Waterpik is perfect for maintaining gum strength and keeps the mouth fresh.</li>
    <li> This Waterpik is such an improvement over the less expensive model we used to own.  Though the Aquarious is somewhat taller, it&#x27;s compact, more graceful shape makes it seem to fit better on the shelf beside our sink.  The hinged lid over the water reservoir lifts easily, slips back in place neatly, and is cinch to wipe clean.  The clear plastic reservoir seems to have just the right volume to do a thorough job of flossing my teeth.  The pik handle fits comfortably in my hand no matter how I turn it.  Better still, when I am done, the handle fits easily into the v-shaped holder as the coiled plastic hose slides right into place.  The assortment of tips seems irrelevant to me, as does the &#x27;massage&#x27; mode on the dial.  One tip on &#x27;floss&#x27; works well every time, though I do appreciate the option of varying the strength of the spray by turning the dial.  My husband and I are very pleased with this product and expect it to run well for years.</li>
    <li> I love this water flosser.  The water flow can be as strong or soft as you desire.  I use it about 60% capacity and it is plenty sufficient to effectively flush out all the food residue and particles from deep within the gums between the teeth.  Price is good.  Construction is good although not as heavy as others I have had.  For the price, it is well worth the money and gets the job node</li>
    <li> This product was so useful to use for floss. It pump out strong water to wash everything stuck in your teeth such as veggies, meat... There are several level of pressure for the water come out to fit with your reference. The water reservoir is big enough for 2-3 times use. You won&#x27;t be afraid of bleeding gum any more when using this for flossing.</li>
    <li> Gifts--they were happy to receive them especially when DDS recommended!!</li>
    <li> Order arrived very quickly.  This was recommended to me by my hygientist and it works wonders.  I love using it!</li>
    <li> Works well.  Explanations of how to use were good, but a little confusing.  Needed some definition of terms used.</li>
    <li> Very messy, extremely messy, unless you use it in the shower, which I did not. I had to return mines the next day, not because of any issues with it, only because, I did not realize how messy it would be. My orthodontist told me to just use my Sonicare and I will be fine with the plaque..</li>
    <li> It stops while using.</li>
    <li> My teeth feel so clean after, i do add mouthwash to the water</li>
    <li> I love this flosser. I find myself using it 2x/day. It was recommended by my hygienist and was she right. I really like this little machine. I power it up to 10 and floss till it is empty. Been known to do it twice. It takes no time at all to complete.</li>
    <li> Good product and Good service</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for many reasons: 1. I just got adult braces and need to keep up with flossing; 2. the unit is white and so i my bathroom; 3. the star rating was very high. However, I should have looked at the star rating according to date. The newer ratings are the worst. The product worked well for the first 2 weeks. Then it would not work on a setting higher than 2, and I like using the setting at 10. I am doing a product exchange and hope that it works out for the long-term. I read another review written by someone who had the same problem and his 2nd unit also broke after a few weeks. If this happens to me (again), I will purchase one from a real store like Target or Walmart so I I know who is selling me a product and that the product works. I wonder if these units are on sale because they are a bad batch from the manufacturer and were meant to be thrown out or recycled. Maybe they&#x27;re really old. Who knows!</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was Waterpik, and I was certain its products would be wonderful. Wrong. If flossing or a toothpick won&#x27;t do the job, this weak stream won&#x27;t either. Not worth it for the mediocre job it does.</li>
    <li> It is great and is a lot quieter than the previous version of waterpik I had.  The small footprint is perfect for the smaller counter space we have in our motorhome.</li>
    <li> I developed pericoronitis with a flap of tissue extending over my wisdom tooth. This was able to clean in and around the affected area (can be a little nasty) and the condition was taken care of in a matter of 3 or 4 days. Much less expensive than going to a dentist and having them tell you you need surgery. It isn&#x27;t a permanent solution, but this will clean and alleviate symptoms for the foreseeable future for me.</li>
    <li> Cleans well.  Does a good job on removing crumbs and seeds. Similar to flossing.  Haven&#x27;t tried it with mouth wash yet.</li>
    <li> So far, so good!  Works well, lots of power and smaller than my last water pick!</li>
    <li> Things we love about it:&lt;br /&gt;1. Adjustable pressure&lt;br /&gt;2. Ease of use&lt;br /&gt;3. Compact construction and small footprint&lt;br /&gt;4. Removable water reservoir&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things that could be better:&lt;br /&gt;1. The reservoir is a bit small and if one has  brasses or implants may need to fill it more than once&lt;br /&gt;2. price is high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros out weight cons so I gave 5 starts for such a good product.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It makes flossing and cleaning gums really fun. Adding this to my dental hygiene routine has made it easy to clean my gums and made me want to up the rest of my cleaning game. I notice I&#x27;m more thorough brushing. I really would recommend using this product to anyone who needs extra motivation to floss daily. We all know it&#x27;s and important part of dental hygiene so if you&#x27;re looking for a way to make flossing easy, fun and in my opinion more convenient then this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> This thing works great!! My whole family is using it. Got it for daughter with braces and her gums are getting much healthier</li>
    <li> I learned on first usage not to start the thing up unless I was leaning over the sink; otherwise, expect a big splashy spray on your counter, backsplash, and mirror. Seems like common sense, but I guess I wasn&#x27;t thinking. And start with one of the slower speeds; #10 is like a super-focused power washer--not exaggerating. I started cautiously at #2, and I&#x27;ve settled in at #4, which is just right for a good flossing. I haven&#x27;t used the massage setting. The product does a good job, and since I leave it on my bathroom counter, there&#x27;s no &amp;#34;setup&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;put away&amp;#34; chore. Filling and emptying the reservoir is easy-peasy. I haven&#x27;t tried but one of the attachments, but the main one (in the picture) works very well for my purposes. I&#x27;ve also added a shot of mouthwash to the water in the reservoir once, and that was nice; be sure to rinse the reservoir afterward and run a few ounces of clear water through to clear the mechanism.</li>
    <li> Love it only wish that a stand had been included to hold all of the waterpiks.</li>
    <li> My morning and evening routine for cleaning my teeth is easier with better performance and healthy feel, it really takes the agony out of flossing.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  However the water pressure is no different than older models.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing ever.  I highly recommend it to anyone that is looking for a water pick.  Once finished I feel like I just left the dentist office..... That is a good thing.</li>
    <li> Dentist noticed a difference before I had a chance to mention using it.</li>
    <li> Contrary to other reviews, my tubing has stayed perfect ... i.e. goes back just like in the photo every time.</li>
    <li> Nice compact size for the counter.  Works great.</li>
    <li> My last Waterpik lasted about 4 years, so naturally I looked for a new and improved one. I am very satisfied with my new purchase and have been using it for a little over a month. It is very comfortable to use and easy to change the different types of piks.</li>
    <li> Its exactly what we needed.  So we are very pleased.</li>
    <li> I ordered the waterpick because it looks good. Now I can also say that it works well.</li>
    <li> Excellent for keeping the areas under bridgework clean. I also use it to &amp;#34;pressure wash&amp;#34; small items (like ring settings) with hot water...and it works very well for that too!!</li>
    <li> If you are like me and really hate to floss your teeth with traditional floss, then try this product. This is by far the best quality machine out there right now for the consumer level. It hold a decent amount water that can be used all at once for a nice relaxing session or bang out 2-3 1 minute session with the capacity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The waterpik comes with around 5-6 different nozzle pieces that perform different functions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you are first starting out make sure to only use around a 5-6 on the pressure. 10 is either for experts that can withstand the pain, or people who really need to pressure to take the cake off your teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> i had a learning curve.....but i like it; i ordered the tongue washer and i really like that;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will really tell next time i go to dentist&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;maybe wish i had gotten the portable so i could water pik in the shower....but not that big of a deal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;like it just fine</li>
    <li> Nice machine, I like it</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t flossed this much ever!  We&#x27;ll see what the dentist says at next month&#x27;s check up but I am very hopeful. One very cool upside between this and traditional floss is that I have a sizeable gap in between my rear-most molars and food (typically meat) gets stuck in the gap. It is pretty nasty (especially if I don&#x27;t get it out daily).  Regular floss would often push the stuff deeper into the gap and sometimes that would lead to gum irritation and bleeding.  Not anymore!  This device blows the stuff right out and never leaves any behind.  It had gotten so bad my dentist had recommended braces to close the gap...now I can save the $3k.</li>
    <li> I like it very much, but I only wish it could hold more water as I have to refill the chamber twice before I&#x27;m done.</li>
    <li> Performs well. I wish I would have purchased a waterpik years ago. Can&#x27;t believe the difference it makes when cleaning between the teeth.</li>
    <li> OK.  Good flow, get the job done, but pricey for the indifferent quality.  ..and engineered to sell you over-prices replacement tips. Don&#x27;t buy them,  Just wahs the origingal.  This model no longer has what prior models had, replaceable hoses and wands.  ...which fail easily in a variety of ways.  So, your hose cracks and you&#x27;re out the price of a new complete unit.  .</li>
    <li> Works well no complaints so far</li>
    <li> Good for kids with braces. It is Flimsy compared to the old Waterpicks.</li>
    <li> I love using the Waterpik with my braces when I don&#x27;t have time to do a 15 minute flossing regimen (all those with braces will know what I am referring to). It&#x27;s a quick 2-3 minute floss that feel pretty thorough and my teeth feel very clean! It&#x27;s also very good for your gums just as a stimulating massage. I think this product is just great for overall oral health, with or without braces.</li>
    <li> I think it is very useful.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend is now reconsidering my marriage proposal!&lt;br /&gt;The cat no longer hisses at my kisses!&lt;br /&gt;Flowers don&#x27;t close when I try to sniff them!&lt;br /&gt;The dentist stopped charging me double!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My goodness... I do say.. This Waterpik doesn&#x27;t replace good ol&#x27; flossing but it definitely does 75% of the job in a fraction of the time.  It&#x27;s as radical of a difference between manual vs electric toothbrushes.  However, if you have deep pockets and tight teeth like myself, you&#x27;ll still need to dig down in the trenches to get the persistent bits out.  The difference is that you won&#x27;t have to spend so much time at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend added some Neem Mouthwash to the solution.  Feel free to get carried away with several sessions of &amp;#34;Waterpikkin&amp;#34; at a time!  This thing feels amazing.</li>
    <li> Works good would recommend to others</li>
    <li> Works great! I love &amp; use it everyday. It provides plenty of water pressure, even at setting &amp;#34;8&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> terrific!  it&#x27;s the one that the dentist reccommends</li>
    <li> I have been regularly using the WP-100 for 4+ months now and been pretty happy with it, for the records, I have not had any dental problems since then.  The reason why I went for a WP-100 is due to frequent dental visits because of my narrow inter-teeth space which I could not work with floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the WP-660 is a decent upgrade - pause every few seconds, additional tips ...  and since there is very little difference in cost between the WP-660 and WP-100 : WP-660 is definitely a better choice.  If you already have a WP-100, it may not be a worthy upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - Waterpik has done a good job in designing and making this unit - just like the WP-100 and another shower head which I am using from the same company !</li>
    <li> Great product great price Thanks!</li>
    <li> If you wear braces, you know how difficult flossing is.  It&#x27;s awkward and time consuming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still floss the old-fashioned way too (it&#x27;s essential), but this Water Flosser gets to where the regular floss can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before this, I was using a hand-held portable irrigator from Panasonic.  It&#x27;s great for travel since it&#x27;s battery operated and small, but the Water Flosser does a lot more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How much more?  For starters you can choose light water pressure, heavy, and many settings in between.  There are a number of different interchangeable tips you can use (wish these were labeled better).  And, there are on/off switches on both the unit and the wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, it cleans your mouth really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> Purchased this to replace a previous model Water Pik. Works great. I like this one because the water reservoir has a flip top lid and is easy to remove to fill up. The only thing it does that I find mildly irritating is that as the motor runs it will periodically hesitate (like it skipped a beat). Water pressure stays up and it continues to do the job I expected, but that momentary hesitation almost makes me think the power just blinked off. We have found that using a water pick daily has done a LOT in helping us with dental hygiene, requiring far fewer visits to the dentist every year. While I use it once daily before bed, my wife uses it 2-3 times a day. She had periodontal treatments several years ago and now the dental hygienist is always amazed her teeth stay as clean as they do.</li>
    <li> Works great better than flossing the old way</li>
    <li> works great , not exactly quiet though,but great product.</li>
    <li> my demist has told be for years to get a water pik ....never would wait again. Its wonderful and your teeth felt cleaner.</li>
    <li> I have been using it every day and now my teeth are much happier and my gums are loving the free massage...</li>
    <li> THEY ARE GREAT AS THIS IS MY SECOND ONE</li>
    <li> The waterpik is great you can&#x27;t get a a better cleaner feeling!!!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s the best shipment and product</li>
    <li> This product provides amazing flossing benefits.  I was able to cancel gum surgery because of the great results I got from using the Waterpik Flosser every night.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone with periodontic issues.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an older Water Pik, and it&#x27;s quite an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1.The pik has an on/off button, which my old one didn&#x27;t have. On the old one, I&#x27;d have to keep my finger pressed pretty firmly, or water would go all over the place if I wasn&#x27;t careful. With this, I don&#x27;t have that problem.&lt;br /&gt;2. I like the fact that this has a water well top that is hinged, and doesn&#x27;t come off. The old one had a removable top, and I would often end up dropping it into the water well. Maybe I&#x27;m just extra clumsy, but I hated that.&lt;br /&gt;3. Bless Water Pik for making this in different colors! I don&#x27;t know why people who make bathroom stuff like this, think that we all like blue, because I don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s so nice to have this white one, which blends in better with my bathroom decor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. This thing is noisy! I don&#x27;t know if they can make it any quieter, but I hope someday they can.&lt;br /&gt;2. It would have been nice to have a bit more storage for the other piks that came with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REBATE:&lt;br /&gt;The day I found this, I noticed a line that said &amp;#34;$15 rebate on this item.&amp;#34; However, the next day, it had disappeared. I went to the Water Pik website, and they had nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I contacted Water Pik, and they sent me the rebate form. When I got it, the rebate said something about a receipt from a dentist&#x27;s office, so I contacted them again and said I had bought it from Amazon. They said it would be fine as long as I sent the Amazon receipt along with the rebate form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My rebate got here fairly quickly, so if you&#x27;re willing to go to some trouble, you can get $15 back!</li>
    <li> This is my review of the Waterpik Aquarius Water Flosser.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product for my daughter with braces.  I have used it daily as well.  The product is quite compact compared to others I have bought in the past.  Its all white design blended well with my bathroom decor.  The one I ordered came with a few attachments so it can be used by different members of the family.  The water reservoir was big enough to hold the right amount of water for one water flossing.  It was easy to add water.  Just flip the cover the remove the whole reservoir out to the faucet.  The water pressure is adjustable from 1 to 10.  I had to use level 10 while my daughter uses about level 8.  I found it had enough pressure to remove stuck on food (meat) in between hard to reach crevices in between the back molars.  Better than flossing alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I recommend it.  If you are looking for a water flossing device, this one is quite acceptable and was not as expensive.</li>
    <li> I had one of these years ago, and for some reason haven&#x27;t had one for many years. I use it every night to clean any remnants of food out of my mouth, That way when I go to bed, don&#x27;t have to taste supper all night.</li>
    <li> This is my second Waterpik.  As did its predecessor, this flossing tool does an excellent job of providing an invigorating clean deep down.  And while I still use traditional floss a couple of times a week just to stimulate my gums, I use this twice daily and always feel refreshed.  It also can be used with mouthwashes and other liquid rinses if required or recommended by your dentist.  The new version is easier than ever to use and comes with different tips for specific needs.</li>
    <li> this works as described - but is very lightweight - I end up knocking it over.  wish it was heavy like one I had years ago.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the Waterpik Aquarius Professional Water Flosser.  I have been using a waterpik for almost 15 years.  What I like about this one is that it is 2 buttons, one if you want to floss and another one if you want to massage your gums.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It dose not work now.the motor is broken.only use it for 8 mouth.</li>
    <li> Perfect... my teeth love it as do I</li>
    <li> ok but not the best quality. would not buy again</li>
    <li> good product.  Off/on switch does not work well.  Hopefully will get better with use</li>
    <li> Works great, but still need dental floss and proxy brush as back up for my gum issues.</li>
    <li> I found it very difficult to use, water sprayed all over the place.</li>
    <li> user friendly.  reliable so far.  hold plenty of water.  i can feel a difference in my gums already.</li>
    <li> everyday use. could be more powerful</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a water flosser before and it takes getting used to. I love the way my teeth feel after water flossing and brushing; like I just came from the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;It was my hygienist who recommended Waterpik.</li>
    <li> I like the size, conveniece of filing, ease of cleaning, storage of tips, and the ease of changing the water pressure.  The only problem I have is dripping of the tool while using it.  It is new and I may be able to control the dripping better as I get more practice.</li>
    <li> Light, compact and just as powerful as my &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; waterpik.</li>
    <li> I love this waterpik. My dental hygienist recently suggested I purchase this because it does a better job than flossing. And it surely does! I am very happy to add this to my personal hygiene routine.</li>
    <li> It is the best model of Waterpik, and is essential in my dental care!  My hygienist always gives me high marks!!</li>
    <li> Really happy with this purchase, does a great job of gently cleaning between your teeth. Delivered on time.</li>
    <li> I have owned 3 Waterpiks now. The last one developed a crack in the hose just below the wand. That is the bad news. The good news is that I would never go without one. It has kept my teeth and gums healthy with reduced plague. This model is more powerful than my last one.</li>
    <li> I like it seems to do the job</li>
    <li> Purchased for my child to clean around her palatal expander and she loves it!  It&#x27;s easy to use, sleek looking and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> My dentist loves me now. Made a BIG difference in health of gums. Deserves more publicity.</li>
    <li> I LOVE my new waterpik...The first time I used it, I used my new Sonicare toothbrush the same night. First, I loved Amazon&#x27;s same day delivery.  I ordered them both Saturday morning, and Saturday night I had a &amp;#34;just went to the dentist&amp;#34; brushing experience in my bathroom.  I laid in bed and kept running my tongue over my teeth...my mouth felt so fresh and clean!  I have since started putting a little Listerine in the water to add an additional dimension to the freshness...</li>
    <li> Good product, but wish the basin would hold more water.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I&#x27;m addicted. Never usd another water pick so can&#x27;t compare bit love this one. Take a little bit to get used to letting the water come out. Keep your head down over the sink.</li>
    <li> Everything arrived on time and it good condition.  It comes with a toothbrush attachment and several other attachments.  It seems to work well. The switch on the side that turns the water on is kind of hard to use when you are holding it in your mouth.  It would be much better if it was a button instead of a switch.</li>
    <li> Confirmed Waterpik user; prior model stopped working.  This one fills the bill.  Easy to use and smaller footprint.</li>
    <li> me and family use it everyday, a must have tool for family for dental cleaning</li>
    <li> Awesome!  I purchased March 12, and started using a couple of days later when it arrived.  I have always been barked at by my dentists and hygienists about being the Queen of Plaque...use electric toothbrush, floss every day with no improvement.  Saw my dentist yesterday for some work (after using the Water Pik for 2 weeks) and she raved about how good my teeth looked and called her assistant to see.  This after only 2 weeks!  Easy to use, easy to store.  IMy Water Pik is saving my teeth!</li>
    <li> I bought a Waterpik WP-660 Aquarius Professional Water Flosser through Amazon.com. The product has been delivered promptly but didn&#x27;t function at all. The hotline of the Firm producing /merchandizing Whaterpik didn&#x27;t work. I sent back the product for replacement. I got a new one, again not working. No power getting to the Waterpik. Of course I tried to get it started according to the description, of course there is power in the socket and of course the voltage corresponds exactly with the one required by the machine. I could send it back again. Considering that I have spent about 60US$ to send back the first water flosser any further spending would be ridiculous. I kindly ask Amazon for a feedback and for a reconsideration to sell a product which obviously is of very poor quality.[[ASIN:B00HFQQ0VU Waterpik WP-660 Aquarius Professional Water Flosser]]</li>
    <li> This a new and improved model from Water Pic.  I have been using an old one for two years and it&#x27;s still going as well.  Two years ago a dentist told me I was on the cusp of periodontal disease, and he wanted to sell me expensive dental treatments.  I did some research, bought a water pic, use it faithfully with hydrogen peroxide and water, and I haven&#x27;t had any problem since.  I changed dentist&#x27;s needlesstosay, the new dentist has continually marvelled over the last two years at how healthy my gums are.  I should have used one of these years ago, but I&#x27;m sure glad I have it now.  Also, it&#x27;s easy and price-wise to shop at Amazon.</li>
    <li> The waterpik WP-660 not only functions as advertised, it also looks nice in our bathroom. I alternate hand flossing with the use of this device.Frances</li>
    <li> I have some pockets. My dental hygienist said I needed a better water pik  with a rubber tip. I hope this is doing the job.</li>
    <li> I have used both of the current popular versions of the Waterpik and I think most reviewers lean toward the older two-tone model, but I actually really prefer this one. I think the controls offer a lot more pressure variety. I do agree, however, that there is less storage room and that is a problem. That said, it cleans your teeth exceptionally well and my dentist has commented on how much it improved the health of my gums. I&#x27;m a big fan! I do wish the power cord were longer (it&#x27;s about four feet long by my estimate), but that&#x27;s the only real drawback.</li>
    <li> Love it. First time using a flossing machine and i&#x27;m glad i purchased this one.  It is a little messy at first when you&#x27;re first learning to use it, but once you figure out how to let the water run out of your mouth, it&#x27;s a piece of cake.</li>
    <li> The item was of wrong voltage 120V instead of 240V as required in Australia</li>
    <li> The best waterpik yet!!</li>
    <li> I got this at a good price and it seems to be working fine so far. I am using distilled water with it so it doesn&#x27;t clog up the machine with minerals from regular water. There&#x27;s a short period of learning how to use it. I hate flossing so I don&#x27;t do it often enough. I am using this to supplement my flossing. It doesn&#x27;t get rid of flossing completely but it helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/6/15&lt;br /&gt;After about a year of using this, I have some recommendations and a revision of my review. I am reducing it from 5 to 3 stars mainly because the design could be better. If you think about it whenever you deal with water, if you have gaps water will enter it. The handle has so many gaps that it eventually grew mildew. I did fix it by spraying bleach into it.</li>
    <li> The stream is not strong enough, I have to use the smallest valve. Then, why did I pay for all the other valves/brushes?</li>
    <li> It should state &amp;#34;Safe, Gentle... and LOUD!&amp;#34; When I received this item, I was really excited to try it. I filled it up, hit the power button and the motor started running. I was shocked at how a little device could make so much noise. If you adjust the water flow to the highest point, it gets even louder. As for using the item, it will take a little bit of practice as you may spray places other than in your mouth. It is pretty easy and simple to use, and overall I would recommend this item for good clean dental hygiene.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had at least five Waterpik products over the years and this one is the best so far.  The operation is straight forward and identical to my previous model but it&#x27;s quieter and smother in operation.  If you have dental issues or bridges that make flossing difficult or even impossible, this is the product you want.  It may take some time to get used to if you&#x27;ve never used one before so start on the lower pressures. The only fault is that it&#x27;s difficult to pack for travel.  I have a Panasonic battery-operated unit for travel but the pressure is less - - I&#x27;m always glad to get home to the real thing.</li>
    <li> Have used it for about 2 weeks now, and I am up to the number 8 level.  I think it works as good as or better than flossing.  I tried flossing afterwards to see if it missed anything and the one time I did this, it hadn&#x27;t.  My dentist highly recommended we use this even though he always said I had good hygiene.  Like the smaller design, doesn&#x27;t take up too much room and I just hand wash tip right after I am done.</li>
    <li> Works really well.  I initally bought this to replace flossing, but there are some dissenting opinions on whether water flossers can completely replace regular flossing.  I still floss but then use the Waterpik immediately afterward with a mixture of 95% water and 5% mouthwash.  It&#x27;s truly like a blast of freshness, and it doesn&#x27;t take long go through all your teeth.  I find that even after flossing the Waterpik still blasts out some food particles that I missed.  I have a dentist appointment coming up so I&#x27;m looking forward to discussing this new flossing option with the dentist to get his opinion.  I&#x27;m really happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Needs a better place to store heads and keep them sanitary. Works great and does the job!</li>
    <li> The button on the handle sticks so I have to mess around with it a bit which can make a mess some times, but it&#x27;s livable.  I love the way my teeth look and my gums feel after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it after I brush every time.</li>
    <li> Excellent easy to use and not messy like some models.  changing the tips is a breeze. Great value for the money. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great flosser.  I have gotten great check-ups from my denist since using this.  This flosser is so powerful that it gets down deep into your gums. I definitely recommend if you&#x27;re looking for a flosser with great results.</li>
    <li> It belongs to my wife and she has tried it a few times so cannot say a whole lot about this product.</li>
    <li> By far the best! Over the years I&#x27;ve owned the Classic (WP 60/65), and the Ultra (WP-100) and now the Aquarius. The Classic was the loudest and probably the most powerful. It lasted over 5 years with daily use. The Ultra is quieter, but less powerful. Even at 10 it seemed like 7 or 8 compared to the Classic setting. The Ultra lasted roughly 5 years before the flosser hose began leaking. The Ultra is built heavier than both but much less powerful. I was sort of glad when I had to replace it. I bought the Aquarius about three weeks ago and loved it, it&#x27;s more powerful than the Ultra which feels you&#x27;re getting a much better cleaning. It&#x27;s lighter, sleek and the holder works fine for me. I was a little hesitant at first after reading some of the reviews about it&#x27;s quality. But for me this one has the power of the classic but much quieter and a better design than the previous models.</li>
    <li> Love the different modes and attachments. Great product that works very well.</li>
    <li> My wife loved it, saying it works great. She was amused as to how it sounds just like a pressure washer! She was satisfied with the ease of use and adjustable pressure. A bit messy with water spraying outward but not a large quantity.</li>
    <li> I hate flossing. I don&#x27;t mind this at all. It works really well. And my dentist says it is just as good as flossing but recommended not to use on the highest setting.</li>
    <li> it works great.  One of the attachments (per) squirted out the side and i can&#x27;t use.  All others worked fine.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been 18 months now since I purchased this product. It has literally saved my teeth and my gums. My dentist is so pleased and so am I in the improvements. It does not replace regular string flossing but actually enhances flossing by removing minute debris from crowns and hard areas. My gums longer bleed. It took 6 months to see a difference and a full year to the point I no longer have pain when my teeth are cleaned.</li>
    <li> Satisfaction, well-contented</li>
    <li> I really like it - much better than the battery operated one.</li>
    <li> If I could give the Waterpik Aquarius Water Flosser higher than five stars, I would. Not only did I love the effectiveness of the product, I was totally thrilled by the report given to me by the dentist and his assistant. They raved over the results! I am so happy about this product, I immediately ordered a second one for a family member. If you are wondering if you should buy this model of the Waterpik -- go for it. The money that you will save down the line at the dentist&#x27;s office will prove how good it really is!</li>
    <li> I have to give it 5 stars as it works perfectly fine and does everything it should. I don&#x27;t love it because you always end up with a counter top covered in water. I had the portable one you use in the shower as well, but really.. just get some dental floss (wide) and a water glass. Why do we buy this stuff?! (Yes I have the dang oralB electric tooth brush as well, it looks nice sitting on the counter and it&#x27;s a great dust collecter!) I still brush my teeth thrice a day using the good old fashioned tooth brush.</li>
    <li> recommended by dentist.</li>
    <li> Works OK, but makes a bit of a mess</li>
    <li> Good product. The on/off switch on the handle is a little difficult to use...especially when trying to turn it off while the water is squirting out. Definitely notice a different in my gums being healthier and less sensitive after a couple weeks of use.</li>
    <li> This thing is a joke.  First, it is MUCH SMALLER that it appears in any picture I have seen and holds only about a cup and a half of solution, if even that much.  It is powered by a pathetic little toy pump motor.  It is nothing like the workhorse WP60W series WaterPik units that long time users of this product are familiar with.  I was so disappointed when I took it out of the package that I put it right back in and arranged for a refund.  I feel sorry for those naive customers who were led to believe it is a \\&quot;professional\\&quot; unit when in fact it is just a plastic bathroom toy.</li>
    <li> The on/off switch was extremely hard to move.  Besides that, it is messy.  I would rather use dental floss.  Returned item.</li>
    <li> Great alternative to flossing. I currently have braces and have started to get a bit of inflammation around the top of the brackets. The water pick is great to get to any spot that is near impossible to reach. My mouth has not felt cleaner in months. One thing to be careful is not to put the power too high or can irritate the gums worse than they are and could cause attachment loss and gum recession. I am using mine at 4-5 and I can feel 100% comfortable using it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another little recommendation is to through some listerine about 10 ml in with the warm water to get a minty clean feeling :)</li>
    <li> Easy to use and effective. Small unit fits nicely on our small bathroom countertop.</li>
    <li> Too loud.  Sounds like the same waterpik my parents had 40 years ago</li>
    <li> Got braces love this thing !!</li>
    <li> I wear braces and this thing helps me reduce a good deal of time every day for shiny teeth.  The only complaint I have is the on/off button on the handle is very hard to switch - to a point that I have to use the main switch after I put the mouth piece in.</li>
    <li> Works amazing!!  Definitely a great purchase!</li>
    <li> love it....my gums were bleeding before ,,now there not ..and feel much cleaner</li>
    <li> This water pick dose an outstanding job. I have at setting 2 and I can see the difference  in my teeth and gums after a few days use. It is good for cleaning between the teeth where the toothbrush miss. If you get this follow the directions. Money well spent.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have matching flossers and we both love ours!  We like the smaller wand and the&lt;br /&gt;massage option and the different speeds..</li>
    <li> Excellent buy and works great.</li>
    <li> I really like my water pick, it dose a great job helping me keep my teeth an gums clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a waterpik since I got braces...I loved it so much that I had to buy another with the hose split on the old one.</li>
    <li> Blew the enamel off my tooth at pressure setting 6.  I imagine my dental bill is going to be at least five times the price of this thing I bought to alleviate gum issues. Sigh.</li>
    <li> My 12yr old son uses this waterpik &amp; it does a great job around his teeth &amp; brace&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again</li>
    <li> Vibrates too much, really noisy, messy but works great and way better than flossing since it tackles the front,and back of the teeth in detail.&lt;br /&gt;I personally like the plaque head the best because of the little brush.</li>
    <li> Works as expected. Takes some getting use to. Water &amp;#34;everywhere&amp;#34; in the beginning.</li>
    <li> Does a super job of cleaning and massage.</li>
    <li> I really needed this. It has a very small footprint. I followed the instructions, and have had great results!</li>
    <li> This item is great and It meets all the expectations that I need and was looking for.</li>
    <li> Waterpik does a Great Job getting between your teeth and giving your mouth that great clean feeling along with brushing</li>
    <li> My wife says &amp;#34;It&#x27;s Great&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik Aquarius Water Flosser is great!  I had been told by my dentist that I had &amp;#34;deep pockets&amp;#34;,  in which bacteria can gather and cause tooth, gum and general health problems.  I had deep cleaning done several times along with antibiotic treatments.  However the thing that has helped the most was the water flosser.  The &amp;#34;deep pockets&amp;#34; are becoming more shallow, so that the issue is no longer a problem.</li>
    <li> Hate going to the dentist? Absolute must have to use on a daily basis. Works great!</li>
    <li> I love the effectiveness of this &amp;#34;water flosser&amp;#34;.  It is much more pleasant to use, for me, than regular floss.  I subtracted one star because the pump--is--LOUD.  I would gladly pay 50% more for a product with a little more weight and sound insulation or vibration isolation.</li>
    <li> A lot better than flossing. It takes less than one minute. You can not believe the partials of food that come out after using a Oral B electric toothbrush. Highly suggest.</li>
    <li> Works well and is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I  use the waterpik treatment every evening before bed.  Sometimes I notice chunks of food that I formally would have slept with.</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 Aquarius Water Flosser (WP-660) for my husband and me.  Unfortunately both units were defective.  The ON/OFF water switch on the handles could not be moved.  Other reviewers had the same problem.  Retuning both units.</li>
    <li> Bought for my 14 year old son with braces.  He loves it and says it cleans great and gets into and cleans areas the brush cant.  He likes the on off switch on the handle and all the tips.</li>
    <li> It works great mouth feels a lot better and it&#x27;s only been 3 days</li>
    <li> Out of the package, followed directions to prime at highest setting. Pik hose unit leaked water for several seconds, creating a puddle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did it again, leaked again. Leaks near electrical housing are not that dangerous but not sanitary. Back it goes. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I had no idea that so many food particles could remain in between your teeth after brushing! everyone should have one.</li>
    <li> Everything turned out okay, Thank You FJG</li>
    <li> I have a bridge, so this Waterpik is great for getting all the bits of food out!  It&#x27;s actually quite soothing, too!</li>
    <li> Greet product, clean teeth</li>
    <li> Works great! Gets all food particles out between teeth.</li>
    <li> Dentist said there had been improvement in gum condition</li>
    <li> My dental hygenists suggested  getting a water pik to use in conjunction with flossing.  This works really well.</li>
    <li> Really cleans around crowns.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several Waterpik water flossers over the years. This one is the most compact and lightest, but the plastic is thinner. I&#x27;ve given it 4/5 stars only because I&#x27;m a bit concerned that without TLC treatment, it could break.  The feature I appreciate the most is the attached cover. It doesn&#x27;t have to be removed to access/remove the water reservoir.  Had my old one for about 10 years before the motor konked. ALSO, Waterpik&#x27;s website store offers the same unit for $20 more than Amazon.</li>
    <li> It is allright. Not satisfied to have encouter one pik can not be fixed on and ask for one exchange. The new one is ok.</li>
    <li> Ive all ways wanted one and this one is just what my dentist recommended. I love it bought one for every body in the family.</li>
    <li> This is my third Waterpik product.  I bought this to have set up at home so that I don&#x27;t have to unpack my travel Waterpik when I&#x27;m home.  This provides a lot of features and great water capacity.  I don&#x27;t use the massage feature but do use the regular flossing mode.  I&#x27;d say that this is by far my favorite Waterpik in my line up.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I bought this...a few weeks ago, and I use it twice a week. At the first time, I feel the pressure (even in the lower level) little bit high....but about three times later, it changes to &#x27;clean&#x27; feeling. I use this waterpick with sonic toothbrush...and feel healthier than before.</li>
    <li> Love my new toy.  Nice teeth are definitely under-rated:)</li>
    <li> actually easy to use and seems to get more than just flossing</li>
    <li> if you care about your teeth this is it. simple and easy flosser</li>
    <li> Good product, my only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t seem as powerful as the older model I had.  I like that this one comes with several tips for various uses.  Haven&#x27;t tried all of them yet, but those I did try worked fine.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing.  My wife has braces and says every time she uses it she feels like she just got home from the dentist.  I only wish I&#x27;d ordered it sooner!</li>
    <li> the water runs out too quickly, but overall a very good waterpik</li>
    <li> I love this waterpik  it is so much better than floss  and I love the toothbrush</li>
    <li> I just had major dental work done several months ago ... lower teeth pulled, 4 implants with attached bridge put in and needed a good Waterpik to protect my investment.  I had bought a cheap CVS battery operated knock-off initially and found that ... you really do get what you pay for!  This was a great replacement and a great find.  It is well made; great quality and has all the bells and whistles and love the fact that I am not always replacing batteries.  You will not be disappointed ... I highly recommend this model.  Just what I was looking for and just wish I had bought this initially!</li>
    <li> You need to ask yourself 3 questions before buying this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1:  Do you have plenty of room by a sink to set this while you use it?  This is not a small product, and for those of us with stand alone sinks, it may be a tight fit to have it sitting on the side.  It works much better for those with sinks set in counters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2: Is the noise of the pump operating going to bother you?  It is not very quiet to be honest.  I found it to be much louder then I expected and it makes it a problem to use depending on the time of night because of the location to bedrooms with sleeping people (especially if they are light sleepers or noise sensitive)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3: Are you ok with water splattering everywhere?  Look, you can close your mouth mostly while using it, and the directions specifically show someone with their mouth barely open letting the excess water trickle out and into the sink.  But the reality is that for certain spots in your mouth, you have to adjust how your mouth is positioned, or how open it is.  No matter what, you will get some water splatter all over the area, and if you are not careful outside the &amp;#34;sink zone&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, this product does work.  It cleans better then any flossing device I have ever used.  My mouth gets cleaner then ever before.  But there are problems and drawbacks that while to some degree I expected, I was not expecting them to be as big a problem as they are.  It works, but it also feels like an epic project that takes more time, effort, and care then I ever expected.  That&#x27;s disappointing to me for the price, because I feel like I dont want to, or cant, use it daily.</li>
    <li> I was having some issues, so decided to try this Waterpik. If you are also looking, I would recommend this particular model. What I like about it, that it is small &amp; fits great on my counter. It does come with various &amp;#34;heads&amp;#34; (which I haven&#x27;t tried yet) but it does seem to offer a great product, for a very reasonable price. I would recommend this Waterpik.</li>
    <li> using for awhile now and working great</li>
    <li> Easy and effective, not as messy as I thought it would be</li>
    <li> Mouth, and dentist, noticeable difference without the misery of flossing.</li>
    <li> Its an excellent item,I really recommend it!!</li>
    <li> This Waterpik works great!  No issues and plenty of cleaning power.</li>
    <li> This is my second Waterpik.  I used my last one so long the plastic was yellowed and ugly.  Anyone familar with the Waterpiks will be right at home with this, it is just the updated version of the product with a few improvements.  If you havent used one, be warned, once you do you wont be able to get by without one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will be amazed, and kind of grossed out, when you see how much &#x27;stuff&#x27; gets washed from between your teeth when you first start using a Waterpik.  I dont mean right after you eat and instead of brushing, I mean AFTER you brush your teeth.  The effectiveness of the Waterpik is amazing and you will be astounded at how well it works and how clean your mouth feels afterward.  My favorite trick is to add mouthwash to the water when I use it, it leaves a mouth freshness far beyond brushing or mouthwash, and it does it without the harsh burn of mouthwash alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit is smaller than my previous Waterpik, but it is sized to fit on the counter well and holds just the right amount of water.  The new features include a &#x27;studder&#x27; in the cycle every 30 seconds to allow you to time how long you clean each section of your mouth, just like the electric toothbrushes have now.  There are floss and massage settings on the unit, though admittedly I personally think the massage setting is pointless.  There are pressure settings on the unit, and another on/off and pressure setting on the handle as well.  This makes it very easy to use and prevents spraying your mirrors when you turn the unit on or off.  Even the coiled hose is well thought out, as it re-coils effortlessly and holds the handle perfectly in the unit, just like in the photo.  The water basin comes off and on easily without any leaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is another great Waterpik and has upgrades worthy of the &amp;#34;new model&amp;#34; product instead of simply a new version of the same product.  I have recommended these to my friends, and recommend to anyone wanting a fresher mouth or simpler way to clean between their teeth.</li>
    <li> So my old a-la-Starwars/Sturmtrooper face mask blue bin Waterpik broke, mainly due to the short length of tubing and stretches required to make it reach the oral cavity of this 6&#x27;4&amp;#34; user. I pre-ordered the WP-60 and resigned myself to the anemic jet on an old Braun Oral-B dental center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Observations compared to old model:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Much better looking, the rubberized buttons, and rubber tension reliever at end of wand make it so cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Water tank more ergonomic and easy to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Tubing longer, with wider loops, and stress relief at wand. These two features should make it last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. STRONGER!!! Be warned, it will make your gums hemorrhage at &amp;#34;10&amp;#34;, the new &amp;#34;8&amp;#34; is the old &amp;#34;10&amp;#34; IMHO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Massage function not of any use to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YES, after two weeks of daily use I volunteer to state that it is refreshing to see that this product is an improvement&lt;br /&gt;over the old model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep going to the dental hygienist every 6mos, hardly any plaque, thank you Waterpik!</li>
    <li> This is a good product upgrade to replace a much older model that I could no longer repair. I use this one more often and we will see in 6 months if my dental checkup is better.</li>
    <li> It works better than what I thought. I was not expecting such a quality. the size of tank and length of hose is perfect.</li>
    <li> Very useful thing. I have never thougt that gums and teeth could be cleaned in a such effective way. Very useful within an orthodontic treatment. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Easy to set up, easy to use. Keeps my mouth clean and happy!  I choose to use filtered water instead of tap, but like that you can also use a rinse aid or mouth wash in it also.  Haven&#x27;t tried that yet though.  I still use regular floss and follow up with the Waterpik, but I do notice a difference after having used it several times so far.  Worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> Very useful, powerfully and accurate</li>
    <li> THE UNIT DOES A GOOD JOB EXCEPT THE VALVE ON - OFF BUTTON IS HARD TO OPERATE FOR AN EIGHTY YEAR OLD BUT I CAN CONTROL THE UNIT BY SWITCHING OFF THE ELECTRIC PUMP SWITCH. I CALLED WATERPICK AND THEY SENT ME A NEW CONTROL HEAD BUT IT IS ALSO HARD TO CONTROL.</li>
    <li> How have I not had a Waterpik before? I really don&#x27;t understand how this isn&#x27;t a must have from all dentists.  My teeth have never ever felt cleaner, and I flossed religiously with the normal stuff. I even tried flossing a number of times after using the waterpik to test it, and my floss was spotless. The Waterpik is such an easier tool to use, I now look forward to &amp;#34;flossing&amp;#34; every night and can&#x27;t go to bed without that extra clean feeling. The size of the unit is nice and compact. It doesn&#x27;t take up much counter space and it has a nice long cord if you need to have flexibility in where you keep it.</li>
    <li> The waterpiik works great, we are happy we picked this one over many other ones we were looking at!!</li>
    <li> Been a long time since I&#x27;ve had a Waterpik.  They have made alot of improvements over the years.  Alot of  accessary attachments, many  water flow settings, hose for Water Flosser  can be easily stored when not in use.  Design has appeal, no longer store after under vanity after use.  Noise level isn&#x27;t  bad when used.  Does a great job on my teeth and gums.  Even my Dentist noticed healthier teeth and gums on my last checkup two months later....</li>
    <li> Works very well.  Seems to use more water than my ancient Water Pik did, but it does an excellent job.  My teeth feel very clean and with less plaque.</li>
    <li> Works just as advertised.  An easy way to floss and is able to get most everything out from between teeth.</li>
    <li> I love this water flosser. It really gets my teeth clean. It is compact and is easy to store when not in use. The massage feature is wonderful.</li>
    <li> No problem, satisfaction</li>
    <li> Love this waterpik works very well and does not take up a lot of space on your counter</li>
    <li> This is EXTREMELY loud and clunky!! Sounds terrible but my daughter says it works ok</li>
    <li> Terrific! Good water pressure. Easy to fill and use.</li>
    <li> Terrific little machine, after brushing, you will be surprised how many small  particles are removed by the water pic.</li>
    <li> LOVE this thing! Been using it for about 6 weeks, every night, and I can really tell the difference. Less sore gums, less things getting stuck between teeth. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Very please with this product. Better than most.</li>
    <li> Works great, very strong adjustable pressure.  Nice variety of tips.  Big improvement over the last few years in this machine.  Plan on giving as a gift this Christmas.</li>
    <li> Super cool. I fill it with clear mouthwash instead of water to enhance it&#x27;s effectiveness against cavities! Muah hah ha! The clear aspect isn&#x27;t really important it just looks better aesthetically instead of weird green or blue liquid like embalming fluid or something.</li>
    <li> Works very well, got all of the hard to clean places, my gum health improved greatly after using for just a couple weeks.</li>
    <li> Used this for three months before my dentist visit and no cavities! It takes 30 seconds to use and it powers out all of the crap between your teeth. This is miles better than brushing. Brushing won&#x27;t clean your teeth nearly as good as this, and this takes a quarter of the time. I swear by this thing.</li>
    <li> This waterpik supplements brushing and flossing to make my regular teeth cleaning program more effective.  Also, it stimulates my gums.</li>
    <li> Based on previous review on the website, I expected it more than than my normal floss. But just one trial with this, it seems to be similar. But will see it</li>
    <li> Great  improvement from the earlier waterpik which I used for 5 years.</li>
    <li> I thought for $75 I was getting a quality, high end waterpik.. nope! The previous model i had, that i paid $35 for was stronger, more durable and had a bigger water tank. This thing is a small cheap plastic toy.</li>
    <li> The was brought to me by my dentist.  It&#x27;s easier that flossing and quicker to use</li>
    <li> Love this Waterpic!! nice upgrade from a model I had in the past.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this. Your mouth will never feel so clean as when you use this. It come&#x27;s with several other tip&#x27;s including orthodontic tip&#x27;s[for brace&#x27;s or dental work]. The force of the water flow is unbelieveable. I suggest the setting to be at 4 if you recently had brace&#x27;s put on. This will really put out a spray and the force could be to much on your sore mouth. Once your mouth is no longer tender then you can turn it up. Using the orthodontic tip leave&#x27;s your mouth perfectly clean even at 2-3.</li>
    <li> The only reason I don&#x27;t give this a 5 is that I wish the water container held more water. I have to fill it 2 or 3 times to really do justice to cleaning my mouth. Otherwise, it is fabulous. It works better than the older version of Waterpik that I had because the old one would start spewing water out before I could get it to my mouth. I also like the sleek design. Easily fits between my sink and the wall.</li>
    <li> A comppact unit that is highly efficient.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and will help keep the dental technician at bay!</li>
    <li> Little messy to use but works great to get my teeth cleaned and keep my gums healthy.</li>
    <li> Works great. Comes with a variety of attachments to use or not. Simple to operate. I love it.</li>
    <li> I love the water pik. It worked so good and flossed so well. It came with mutiple brushs. You can make it so it is your kind of setting. The best part of it is it works really good for braces.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work. Normally when I floss my teeth I have to go over and over on my back teeth. This however works so much better than floss. I flossed my teeth afterwards to see if it really worked and there was not one partical of food in between my teeth. And its funner than flossing</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always hated flossing.  My dentist recommended this for me, and I love it.  It&#x27;s easy to use, doesn&#x27;t take much time, and makes my teeth feel so much cleaner!</li>
    <li> This device finds food particles that floss and floss sticks miss. Strength of the pulse can be regulated from gentle to DRILL. My gums are healthier than they&#x27;ve been in years.</li>
    <li> I have had Water Piks in the past, and this one is a clear improvement on past designs.  The two on-off switches actually work well together once you get the hang of them.  The unit is easy to keep clean and dry (which is important, since these used to be mold factories!), and you get a nice assortment of tips to choose from.  I don&#x27;t find the unit as noisy as previous models either.  While flossing is still necessary occasionally, I find that the Water Pik makes my gums and teeth feel cleaner after brushing, without beating up my mouth the way floss tends to, and flossing every night is just a pain.  The Water Pik is a pleasure to use every night and really does get stuff you miss by just brushing.</li>
    <li> My dentist has been recommending I use one of these, so this is the one I finally decided on. I like it better than regular flossing since I have TMJ and after a while my jaw starts to either ache or lock up if I do it the traditional way, even with those little floss picks. Start with the lowest setting the first few times you use it, and adjust to meet your needs. I did not floss before I tried this, just grabbed it and went for it. It did work great, I also have sensitive teeth, so starting out on low is a great idea if you&#x27;re like me and need a second to adjust to it, the temp, whatever. I use a bottle of water, not usually the whole thing and it gets my mouth really clean. I also like that you can use any medication or washes your dentist may have given you with this. Doesn&#x27;t have the tongue scrapper, but I&#x27;m going to buy one and see if it works. It doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of counter space, the cord is plenty long, and I keep the extra attachments in a baggy in the medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> I like this product. It works like I expected and the different tips gives lots of options. Your mouth feels nice and fresh. The lid seems a bit flimsy but the unit works like it should.</li>
    <li> It is perfect for my needs.</li>
    <li> Great&lt;br /&gt;It has helped so much and does such a great job of cleaning the mouth,gums and teeth&lt;br /&gt;The dentist recommend a water flosser.  this is it&lt;br /&gt;Awesome 😆😆😆😆😆</li>
    <li> Seems to do the job that it was designed for but the switch on the handle is way to hard to work. I have very strong hands so it must be impossible for Ladies to work to switch.</li>
    <li> Bought it for me and/or kids, one has braces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON:&lt;br /&gt;- it&#x27;s *not* a real flosser - if you want to replace your regular flossing, you&#x27;re seriously mistaken. After using this (and emptying two full tanks!), regular flossing still gets a lot of stuff out!!! This alone makes it deserve nothing more than 1 star - wish I could give it -1 star.&lt;br /&gt;- the on/off button is extremely poorly designed: while you&#x27;re &amp;#34;flossing&amp;#34; and water is shooting around, to use the button on handle to turn if off is a Nightmare, and often causes water shooting around. I ended up using the button on the main unit instead but that&#x27;s huge annoyance - why have a switch on handle at all if it&#x27;s so hard to impossible to use???&lt;br /&gt;- poor design of the handle rest - it&#x27;s actually a very nice concept and makes it really convenient. there is just one gotcha, a Huge one: after flossing, there is much water left in the handle. There is only one way to rest the handle, and the way will leave water in the handle forever - would have been so much better had it allow handle to rest upside down (to drip-dry)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO: on day one we had water shooting around the counter everywhere. On day three, we were able to adapt and water is mainly in the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;- pretty easy to avoid water mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Do Not buy if you want to replace your regular flossing. - this one is only good for getting rid of food debris after meal - not for flossing.</li>
    <li> I love it!! well worth the money and very helpful with me having braces</li>
    <li> This thing works awesome. I have a very hard time flossing due to tight spacing between my teeth and this really gets them clean. Works better than floss, toothpicks, etc. If I had one complaint, it is the on/off switch on the wand is a little hard to switch. You certainly won&#x27;t accidentally turn it off or on. But other than that it works great.</li>
    <li> Amazing&lt;br /&gt;My husband and I love this item</li>
    <li> It is very noisy, vibrates and the handle where the pick goes in and at the base, leaks. I returned the first one I got to WaterPik, and they sent me a new one, which does the same things, so I assume it&#x27;s a design or manufacturing problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said it does a good job cleaning my teeth.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Does take up a bit of counter space in the bathroom, but its worth it. I&#x27;ve tried 2 of the &amp;#34;portable&amp;#34; models, they didn&#x27;t last any time at all and were ineffective.  So I finally took the plunge and ordered the larger model and I&#x27;ve been very pleased I did.  I&#x27;ve had it for about 6 weeks, no problems or complaints.  I use filtered water in the tank because here in central Texas the water is very hard and causes EVERTHING to clog with debris.  Just a personal choice based on the geographical area,  I want to keep it operating smoothly as long as possible.  Most folks can probably use regular faucet water without problems.  Good product.</li>
    <li> It is too early to know yet if it is actually helping, but I found it easier to use then I thought it would be. I found that I still need to floss, at least every few days, but I am willing to do it every day so far. Perhaps that is because it is a new toy. Some complain about how loud it is, but I don&#x27;t find it that bad. I&#x27;m thinking about adding some salt to the water when I use it. I have not cleaned it yet as I have only been using it for about a week. My main complaint is that I don&#x27;t find the water shut off slider switch to be very easy to operate, especially with wet fingers. Easy to find water spraying every where!</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll be surprised to see how much food remains in your teeth even after brushing thoroughly.  The Waterpik Water Flosser removes this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to water flossing, it will be difficult to use at first.  It will be messy.  You&#x27;ll use more than one tank of water.  It&#x27;s been seven months since I&#x27;ve owned the Waterpik and I use less than one tank of water.  Your gums may bleed alot but this will stop once you use the Waterpik on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is that it is difficult to floss the back of the two front teeth and wisdom teeth.  Waterpik should include a 90 degree tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Waterpik customer service is great.  I needed to replace my handle so I emailed customer support in the evening.  I received a reply about ten minutes later notifying me that a replacement handle has been ordered.</li>
    <li> Works great wish the hoses from machine to mouth was longer</li>
    <li> There is absolutely no pressure in this thing… i am so disappointed, hate it hate it</li>
    <li> I love this machine! My youngest daughter, 13 with braces,  refers to it as the Power Washer and loves it to.</li>
    <li> I recently started Invisalign and this product was recommended to me by someone who also is going through Invisalign. This product has been a lifesaver since I have to floss 3 times a day. Extremely easy to use!</li>
    <li> It works beautifully.  The only problem I have had with it is that the on button on the water pik wand is very stiff and difficult for me to turn on.  Other than that, it is a wonderful product and was recommended by my dentist, Dr. James Engstrom, Saratoga, WY.</li>
    <li> Dentist recommended for me and I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s noisy, but has a powerful pump motor. I don&#x27;t recommend turning it up past 5 or 6 max.</li>
    <li> Verry good Water Flosser! Cleans verry Well!</li>
    <li> Love love love this water flosser. I previously had an older waterpik, and ended up having to throw it out because it would no longer hold a charge. I debated getting another cordless one, but in the end decided on this. I&#x27;m glad I chose this one. It small enough to sit in the corner of my bathroom counter, has a large enough water tank, and works so much better than my cordless one did. My teeth feel so clean after using this. The pressure settings are also really nice. I will never go back to regular flossing alone again.</li>
    <li> My teeth feel so amazing after I use my water flosser, my dentist even ask if I was flossing and I told him ya but with my water flosser, he said well it&#x27;s about time you bought one..LOL Great product, Note you will get alittle wet it you don&#x27;t hold your head over the sink, and you mouth will fill up fast with water, but as of cleaning it works wonders.</li>
    <li> I rate this product as ZERO stars.  Not just bad, not just defective, not just non-functional, but also disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the box, the product had obviously been used and returned, then repackaged and resold.&lt;br /&gt;The plastic bag that holds the tips was ripped open, some of the tips were missing, the remainder had clearly been used, or soiled in some way.&lt;br /&gt;Now, let&#x27;s think about that, a PRODUCT YOU PUT IN YOUR MOUTH, used, returned, repackaged and resold, dirty.&lt;br /&gt;There are actually laws against that in most states for other products that come into contact with bodily fluids, such as underwear.&lt;br /&gt;If this was done by Amazon fulfillment, they should check their records to see who handled the previous return of this item, and fire someone.&lt;br /&gt;On top of all that, the pump system did not work.  I have a PhD in engineering and have designed many health and medical products, so I should be able to figure out how to turn on a waterpik.  This one simply does not work.  I checked everything including the voltage on the AC line.&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;br /&gt;The product sold to me was previously used but sold AS NEW, it was defective, it was unsanitary, just plain disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;So, in my assessment, the product was defective, then it was probably returned for that reason, repackaged by some thoughtless idiot, and resold as new.&lt;br /&gt;I will not return the product, I&#x27;ll keep it for show and tell.  In my profession and for my many students, it will be an excellent example of everything that could possibly go wrong with the marketing and sale of a health/medical product.  For that purpose it is worth the $60.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: in 15 years of on-line shopping, this is only the second negative review I have ever written.  I hope it has a positive effect.</li>
    <li> I could not ever get the on switch to operate.  So had a friend turn it on and I just leave it on.  A little unhandy but made it work. Other than that, so far, does a great job of gum massage and cleaning the hard to reach places.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Use it regularly.  I did have one issue.  I used it for about 6 months and then left for a week long trip.  When I came back it no longer worked.  No power, nothing.  I called the customer service number in the box and they agreed to replace it right away.  I am very pleased with their service so far.</li>
    <li> Very good performance of the device&lt;br /&gt;Delivered on time&lt;br /&gt;Met my expectation</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work very well want to return for refund</li>
    <li> easier to use than the old model</li>
    <li> Excellent! As long as you are not lazy enough to use this every day  at least once (best before going to bed), it really works. My dentist reluctantly agreed that I don&#x27;t need deep cleaning which he recommended a month ago.</li>
    <li> Its a water pic, it does what its supposed to reliably and economically, whats not to like?</li>
    <li> I like my Waterpik! I&#x27;m not the best at flossing daily, so I bought this. It is a little loud, so I have to be be cautious about using it only when my husband is awake. Other than that, I wish I would have purchased one sooner.</li>
    <li> Fulfilled all expectations so far</li>
    <li> Fantastic product!  We love this.</li>
    <li> Waterpik Aquarius Water Flosser is exactly what I wanted.  It does a good job and doesn&#x27;t take up too much room on my counter top.</li>
    <li> it is good as expected, i am now using it daily, very good for teeth health</li>
    <li> Love it! But the motor is a bit noisy.</li>
    <li> Great Waterpik, the on and off switch on the handle is hard to turn on and off. Otherwise it works great.</li>
    <li> Like the old WaterPik my kids used when they wore braces but better looking! I will reserve judgement as to its effectiveness when I next have my teeth cleaned. The hygienist recommended it.</li>
    <li> My second Waterpik.  I like the on/off switch on the handle though it is a little difficult to slide in to the on position. Works well.</li>
    <li> First water flosser purchased so can&#x27;t compare to others but it seems effective.  However, it is difficult to push the on/off switch forward and backward.</li>
    <li> We love it and use it every day. Better than floss.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, does a great job and doesn&#x27;t take up too much space on my bathroom counter.  I recently got Invisalign braces and my dentist recommended I get a water pick to help with my dental care.  I have been using it every night and even after I floss this Waterpik finds some small piece of food I missed.  Lets hope my next dental visit reflexes my heard work</li>
    <li> Works well and has a compact design for smaller sinks.  The pump surges to let you know when you are each quarter of the way through the timer, which I don&#x27;t particularly like.  Another shortfall is the water tank, that while easier to fill then prior models, is smaller.  Overall it a good device and do not regret the purchase.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying my waterpik.  This has been a great addition to my bathroom.  I use it daily!  Seems to really clean and do the job.  My teeth feel cleaner.  I still do brush my teeth and floss daily, but this seems to really get between the teeth.  I can&#x27;t wait to hear what the dentist says when I see him next time.</li>
    <li> Great update on my old Waterpic.</li>
    <li> The front is on the side and the back is too.  The &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; button is usable only if another hand is holding the device still.  Strange design but the squirter works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that the tubing is hard plastic that fatigues and breaks very quickly.  The very expensive repair kit on the comparable Teledyne unit does not function at all well, practically it is a failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So...give it an A for action but an F for design, and an F for probable longevity.</li>
    <li> Love this machine offers multiple uses especially if you have a lot of dental work, cleans teeth and mouth exceptional well</li>
    <li> Product is as described and is a better unit than old unit I replaced as the new unit has a switch on the wand to pause the cleaning and momentarily shut off the water. Very pleased with this unit, the variety of cleaning tools and the performance cleaning my teeth.</li>
    <li> Perfect product. Much better than Philips.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife after the last water irrigator died . She loves it and has found it extremely easy to use.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used this one yet, my old one is 5yrs old, and has improved my gum receding problem so much, I will not have to have surgery!  What&#x27;s an extra few minutes each morning and evening</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with it, it does seem fragile but it does its job perfectly, so far no problem</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product , easy to use , heavy to be stable enough on a corner of my sink table and not to big , so not taking to much space . Just after one week of use I can see huge improvements. My gums in a perfect shape now.</li>
    <li> Best Waterpik product we&#x27;ve ever bought. Have two other models in the past ten years. Easy to fill and great flosser setting options.</li>
    <li> Seems to work great!  I have a weird fear/freakout with things involving dentists, teeth etc.  So when I told my dentist my problem with the concept of flossing, she recommended this product.  At first I was a little scared to try it, but it&#x27;s not bad at all!  Does exactly what it is advertised to do and keeps me from having to force a piece of string in between my teeth (which freaks me out).</li>
    <li> Works great -- child 10 uses it daily for braces.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Makes you gums feel good and helps keep them in good condition.  I use dental floss, so I don&#x27;t know how effective it is for flossing, but the massaging feature is definitely a 5 star rating.  It&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take much time.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised, but for ~$60 there really should be a better system in place for cleaning out the tubing. Mold will grow if you don&#x27;t run a little vinegar (I forget; you can google it) and water through the system every few months.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! Must have it!</li>
    <li> This is a great device. If your shopping for a waterpik then go no further.</li>
    <li> Use it everyday!  It is better than flossing for me.</li>
    <li> Excellent than thread flossing.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s broken. can not use</li>
    <li> The best of consumer water flossers</li>
    <li> Good design. Easy to keep clean. I like it!</li>
    <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED  The product description is misleading. I replaced my former unit (Waterpik Ultra Model)based on the Video and description given.  I thought the handle &amp;#34;on off&amp;#34; switch would be an enhancement that would be beneficial.  I find the switch difficult to use.  In addition the method of storing the extra attachments  ( can only store a maximum of two) is far inferior to the storage method on the Ultra Model.  I am sorry I didn&#x27;t reorder the model that I had.</li>
    <li> It works good, but it makes a loud noise when in use, so far so good, even my 7 year old likes to use it lol</li>
    <li> I love this Waterpik - convenient storage of accessories in top of waterpik - like the amount of water it holds - with previous cordless versions water would run out before finishing flossing. The size is excellent for sitting on sink counter top; doesn&#x27;t take up too much room. I just love every feature about this waterpik.</li>
    <li> Great product! Very effective however turning the machine off from the handle is not correct.  It just stops the spray a little. It does not turn the entire machine off.  Very hard to hold in your mouth, while you find the switch to turn the entire unit off.  I have sprayed the mirror several times.</li>
    <li> This was a present for my wife and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use dental floss every day and in the waterpik.</li>
    <li> needed a new one and this came in two days. Yea!</li>
    <li> Wish I had purchased a Waterpik years ago, the results are amazing!</li>
    <li> Works great and it was packed neatly</li>
    <li> Nice product - works well - my firs experience with a water pik. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been having problems with my gums, so dentist recommended extra cleaning with the Waterpik.  I like this model because the force has a continuous adjustment.  I am keeping it on a low setting (about 4), until my gums heal and can take a higher setting.  They do not bleed after using this Waterpik.  It is amazing how many little particles are left behind after brushing and flossing.  It does help to warm the water when using; cold water is not pleasant.</li>
    <li> My hygienist had been encouraging me to purchase and use one of these.  I finally gave it and bought one.  I have always thought I did a pretty good job of brushing and flossing.  But I was amazed at how much retained &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; this package will flush out.  It comes with a good assortment of tips, so no need to buy extra tips till you determine which tip(s) you will be using.  Great product and a reasonable price.  Well thought out design.</li>
    <li> This is a well-made, easy to use water flosser.  Controls are simple and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this after a tape floss and it does a nice job of flushing out between the teeth.  I do not see this unit as a remover of well stuck food remnants between teeth, though.  The water pressure needed to do that is close to hydraulic mining and not something I&#x27;d try in my mouth!&lt;br /&gt;I often use a couple of tablespoons of Listerine in the reservoir when i fill it and give it a wash when any thing shows on the clear plastic surface when it needs filling.  It is our third type of Waterpik and the best yet!</li>
    <li> I love this thing.  I hate hate hate flossing, but knew I needed to start taking better care of my teeth.  I think it&#x27;s pretty fun to use (maybe I am weird for that)!!  It came with a bunch of different heads, but I really just like the standard one (there were 3 of those).  It gets everywhere floss would go and much more.  I have a permanent retainer along by bottom teeth inside.  It&#x27;s a nightmare to try and floss between those front teeth because of this.  The waterpik makes it super easy.  Very easy to use- after you make a giant mess the first time you quickly learn how to contain the water.  I like the different settings.  I started out at the lowest and have worked my way up as my gums become less sensitive.</li>
    <li> Great Tool For Through Cleaning And Massaging Your Gums. Your Mouth Really Feels Clean After Use. High Recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this electric flosser for a couple of months now. There are more expensive flossers but I can&#x27;t imagine what they would do that this model doesn&#x27;t. It comes with a wide range of &#x27;piks&#x27; including a a little toothbrush. The water flow is strong enough to thoroughly clean every crevice in just 1 02 minutes. It two primary settings for flow (steady stream of water) and &amp;#34;massage (pulses of water). Within each of these settings, the flow can be adjusted via a dial with settings 1 - 10.&lt;br /&gt;When you turn the device on, the water doesn&#x27;t start flowing until you also slide the switch on the hand-held &amp;#34;flosser wand&amp;#34; itself, so you avoid spraying water on your sink before your lips are closed around the wand.&lt;br /&gt;The removable/swappable attachments are durable enough for me to put them in the basket of my dishwasher once a week to keep them extra clean. The cord is long enough to leave it on the counter next to the sink without having to reposition the device when using.</li>
    <li> I had to replace an older model.  Use it everyday.</li>
    <li> 2014 year best choice..</li>
    <li> Great Product, I&#x27;ve had many waterpik&#x27;s and this one is my favorite so far!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s really good for your tooth , i no need to use floss anymore, good one!</li>
    <li> I had a Waterpik years ago, and this is light years ahead of that one.  A great product!</li>
    <li> I recently got braces installed on my teeth. This has been a great help in keeping my teeth and braces clean. It really makes my mouth feel cleaner than just brushing.</li>
    <li> Nice product shipped fast</li>
    <li> We hate it and wern&#x27;t allowed to return it because I mentioned I opened the lid. Didn&#x27;t touch anything!  Seems like a very bad rule. I guess they need the money!!!!</li>
    <li> helps remove the build-up around gums caused by dry mouth syndrome</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace an older version of the waterpik.  I love the new design.  It takes up less space on the bathroom counter and is more powerful than the old one.  Also you can store 2 tips within the confines of the unit.  It&#x27;s brilliant.</li>
    <li> I have Waterpiked for over 40 years and now in my 70s the dentist always says my gums look very good.  Through the years the quality of Waterpik has gone downhill without a doubt along with the power of the stream.  Older designs were better and the units lasted much longer. I have written them about problems a few times and rec. form letters back not offering any solution.  Seems like they would want to talk with someone who has used the product for 40+ years.  Anyway, this unit is better than the last three I&#x27;ve had.  It has more power which is very important for blowing stuff out from between teeth.  The control layout is a bit backward and they should go back to an up and down oriented switch because it can be used with one hand and the unit doesn&#x27;t move when you press the button down instead of sideways. Also, these do not store well, the water resivor</li>
    <li> your mouth is filthy. handle it with this.</li>
    <li> IT WORKS GOOD BUT NEED TO OCASIONALY FLOSS TO GET THE HARDER FOOD PARTICLE BETWEEN YOUR TEETH&lt;br /&gt;AND WILL CONTINUE TO USE BUT IF IT DOESNT WORK WILL SEND BACK</li>
    <li> The new waterpik is great. It is 100% better than flossing. I wish I had bought one years ago.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this particular model. Amazon is the way to go. Their price was great.</li>
    <li> Works well and easy to operate.</li>
    <li> Nice update to my old version, which finally died.  Like the new lid, which flips up and allows user to remove reservoir easily.</li>
    <li> Good product at a fair price</li>
    <li> I love this thing.  A Waterpik was recommended by my Dentist and I was reluctant in getting one for one reason or another.  I am amazed at how well this thing works.  Time will tell and I&#x27;ll see what my Dentist says at my next cleaning.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this, the bathroom looked like a pipe had burst.  I&#x27;ll admit that I&#x27;m clumsy, and have gross/fine motor issues (It was those darn lefty scissors!), but it has taken me a few tries to &#x27;get the swing of it&#x27; (read: not open my mouth).  It works GREAT, it just takes a while for those of us who have no skills.  (You know... those of us who got picked last for dodgeball... yeah, US!)</li>
    <li> Item as stated, great product, fast delivery, smooth transaction overall!</li>
    <li> The water pik is easy to use and has many different heads that are useful. I use it every day and like it much better than I liked my previous water pik.</li>
    <li> seems to work very well, I am hoping it will cut down on my dentist visits and cost!</li>
    <li> Have only used the regular head so far but I really love it. So glad I got it.</li>
    <li> Overall, it works as advertised. The strength of each pulse is adjustable over a wide range (on max it&#x27;s way too much for me). But - it&#x27;s noisy, and doesn&#x27;t sound like a quality item. It&#x27;s a bit large. The hose is stiff. And the slide switch to turn the water on and off is a very bad design choice; this should be a momentary push button (hold down to activate, and shut off with release). Mine has occasional brief hiccups in the stream (it misses a beat); I&#x27;m not sure if this is normal and I hope that it&#x27;s not a sign of problems to come. Still, as I noted, it does get the job done.</li>
    <li> Maybe I did not know what to expect, but the water pressure is not as high as I thought, to justify for &amp;#34;Pick&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Floss&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Like this a lot. The tank size is generous, you can dial your desired water pressure, &amp; it comes with several flosser types. Cleans very well! I had the rechargeable version w/the smaller foot print~I did not like that model &amp; I&#x27;m glad I traded up.</li>
    <li> Great product - strong water pressure - with lots different picks for different purposes.</li>
    <li> This is the best. Everyone should use waterpik!</li>
    <li> What a wonderful machine. Love it. I&#x27;m my own hygienist.</li>
    <li> Great product, My Dad was a Dentist. We had these in the house as kids, the old kind. So the Wife got braces,  I got one for her, She loves it so much she is using it twice a day, Money well Spent, to protect the other money well spent.</li>
    <li> Awesome, much better than my old one and smaller footprint too.</li>
    <li> The machine was great, I like it very much, it work very well.</li>
    <li> Works Great im surprised how good it cleans in between teeth</li>
    <li> I love it so much! This saves me a lot of time compared to regular flossing.</li>
    <li> Keeps my teeth and gums feeling great.</li>
    <li> I bought it because of it&#x27;s compact size and I had other water pic products before.  I like the on/off switch on the handle.  It is a little difficult to get the handle back in it&#x27;s holder, but not as bad as some of the other reviewers have said.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product is somewhat difficult to use as it has so many tips for different uses.  You have to turn the instrument on, then use the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; button on the tank after you put the tip in your mouth; otherwise it is difficult to turn on.  Since it is recommended that the tips be replaced every three (3) months, it will turn out to be a very expensive proposition.</li>
    <li> My son loves this. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love it, cleans teeth great after flossing and brushing, easy to use and the price was great</li>
    <li> Does a really great job! Glad I made this purchase...!</li>
    <li> This Waterpik replaces my old one which did an amazing job cleaning out food particles that the floss, proxi-brush and electric toothbrush missed.  The updated version does the job with a few more perks like speed adjustments and controls on the wand.</li>
    <li> Works good, the pulsing action is intesne, more powerful than my old interplax,</li>
    <li> Works great . . .very light weight - hope it last.</li>
    <li> So convenient and really works well. Very easy to use and quick. I have braces for one year and it makes it so much easier!</li>
    <li> This product works so well, and it is beautifully implemented.  The reservoir is easy to empty and dry, the lid keeps the water clean, and it has such a small footprint.  With 6 implants including one crown covering two teeth, I was finding it impossible to get them clean using floss, picks and a sonicare toothbrush.  The addition of this waterpik made a huge improvement.  The wonderful pick called the plaque seeker with two tiny brushes and a central water jet turned out to be just what was needed to get under the crown overlaps and under that permanent bridge.  I use it on 4 for this purpose.  If you have bridges or implants or problem crowns, this tool will make a difference.</li>
    <li> Finally a great design that works and is intuitively designed for daily use.  We have been replacing our units frequently with various brands.  Most seem to loose water pressure after a year, some even sooner, others seemed to have been designed for extraterrestrials.  This unit has great water pressure and is sensible put together for easy operation, love the way the water feeding tube rolls back in place.</li>
    <li> I have been a Waterpik fan since my dentist suggested using one.  You will be shocked at the effectiveness of this product.  I do use it in addition to traditional flossing.  This item was a gift to my daughter and she and her husband are hooked.  An excellent addition to you daily dental hygiene routine.  The only problem - I had to buy the travel version as I am accustomed to the extra clean feeling after I waterpik!</li>
    <li> I have not owned a Waterpik  previously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit has a generous power cord, takes little counter space, and works like a charm. The differing heads offer a variety of intensity options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a while to figure out the best way to use it, but I am very happy with this purchase. It was recommended to me by my oral hygienist , and I am really enjoying the extra cleaning afforded at the gum line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to a friend!</li>
    <li> It does everything it says just fine. It is very loud and the massage mode is basically worthless.  Also If you like your water to taste like plastic this is the product for you!</li>
    <li> UPDATE JUNE &#x27;17 I&#x27;m sorry to say that my review below may no longer be valid. I recenly saw and handled a Waterpik Ultra at Costco, and while it still has the same model number and general appearance of an Ultra, the build quality and weight felt much cheaper and toy-like compared to the older model I have at home. So I defintiely can&#x27;t claim that the Ultra I handled is any better--and who knows, it might actually be worse--when compared to the Aquarius. Very disappointing for Waterpik to keep the name and model number, while changing the build quality. So in the toss-up between Aquarius and Ultra now, I&#x27;d go with whichever one was cheaper, and if prices are similar, I pick the Aquarius for its better appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE OCT &#x27;14: The Aquarius has dropped significantly in price since my original review, and is actually slightly cheaper now than the older Ultra. So, with prices so comparable, which unit should you buy? Unless you&#x27;re really in love with the updated look of the Aquarius, the Ultra still remains the better choice for the reasons I mention below. Also take a look at the video in the &amp;#34;Most Helpful Favorable Review,&amp;#34; where you can really see the cheap construction of the Aquarius, and how sloppily the hose holsters into the unit compared to the Ultra. This sort of negates its one advantage--the cleaner-looking design--and you&#x27;ll be wrangling to holster that hose on a daily basis. No thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW: Let me not waste your time and cut right to the chase: if you&#x27;re thinking about buying your first Waterpik flosser--or wondering if it&#x27;s time to upgrade your Ultra model--there&#x27;s only one reason to consider the pricey WP-660 Aquarius: it looks nicer and more modern than the now dated design of the Ultra. So if appearance isn&#x27;t important to you, stop reading right here and just go buy the cheaper Ultra, which (as I&#x27;ll get to in a moment) is better in just about every other way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it so happens, an attractive, modern design IS important to me, especially in an appliance that I&#x27;m going to look at all the time in my bathroom. But even in this regard I&#x27;d say the Aquarius is good but not great. It is definitely NOT an improvement in design that will have you looking past its ergonomic flaws vs. the Ultra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the on/off water flow switch is less user friendly in operation than the on/off button on the Ultra. Admittedly, there were issues with button failure at one time on the Ultra, but the replacement handle I received from Waterpik has been working for over a year now with no problems, so this seems to have been resolved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, getting the handle and hose &amp;#34;re-holstered&amp;#34; on the Aquarius is more finicky than it is on the Ultra--plus the hose never seems to sit in the unit as neatly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, the Aquarius weighs A FULL POUND less than the 2.5 pound Ultra, and you can&#x27;t help but think that the weight was trimmed by using a lighter and less durable pump mechanism. Time will tell if that&#x27;s really the case, but I&#x27;ve also found that the lightness of the Aquarius causes it to shift around too easily on my bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, only two tips can be stored in the unit vs. all the tips being storable in the Ultra&#x27;s lid. Waterpik has probably learned that its customers are fine with more limited tip storage, but again, this is no step forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fifth, the dual modes on the Aquarius--which could be seen as its only real advance vs. the single mode Ultra--are just a marketing gimmick. If you just want to massage your gums with the Ultra, simply dial down the water flow pressure and massage away. There&#x27;s no need for a special mode to do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: water flossing is a mature technology, and there are few if any &amp;#34;functional&amp;#34; reasons to introduce a new model. So it&#x27;s a shame that Waterpik didn&#x27;t make more of an effort to at least achieve better ergonomics in a killer new design with the Aquarius. You can pay 20%+ more than the Ultra and get the somewhat nicer looking but ergonomically inferior Aquarius. Or you can just buy the Ultra and not bother to upgrade if you already own it. Both units will give you the same 5-star flossing ability. The Ultra will let you hang onto some extra cash while doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for taking the time to read my review and I hope you find it helpful in making a buying decision!n pay 20%+ more than the Ultra and get the somewhat nicer looking but ergonomically inferior Aquarius.

    <li> My teeth are close together and are hard to floss, especially in the back of my mouth. So, I don&#x27;t like flossing. I use this machine once a day. I bought a second machine for my other house. I think this is better than flossing, and I use hydrogen peroxide in this machine (about three tablespoons in one full tank). Peroxide is inexpensive. My gums no longer have \\&quot;bleeders,\\&quot; and so far I haven&#x27;t had any dental problems since I have been using this machine for two years. I used to have \\&quot;bleeders.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I love the 10 levels of power and all the tips that some with this. The whole family can use it with their own tip and settings.</li>
    <li> very nice. my wife and i use it daily. get the job done, thanks.</li>
    <li> The machine is alright but boy oh boy, not worth $80.  Would never purchase another at this price.  I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
    <li> Works very well and force level is fully adjustable.  Appreciate the two modes; floss or massage.</li>
    <li> I have an older Waterpik that is approximately 5 years old. It&#x27;s done a good job but from the first time I used it, I felt like it was a little rough around the edges and very noisy. This new model is a considerable step up from that earlier one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, the handle has a spray-stop function. On the old one, it was a &amp;#34;press and hold&amp;#34; type of button and even when pressing your hardest, it still dribbled water and made a mess. The new one has a switch, and when it&#x27;s switched off, the water is stopped completely. Very handy when you need to make an adjustment and don&#x27;t need to turn it off entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also includes a massage mode that would be good for those with gum problems by cycling from &amp;#34;floss&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; with the button on the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But most of all, the motor is much quieter, less an obnoxious grind and more of an aggressive purr. I&#x27;m not sure what has changed about how it uses water, but I am able to make it through my entire mouth and take my time where the old unit would have me rushing through to finish. Appears to be about the same amount of water, and they both do an equally good job, so the new model must be more efficient in some way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One minor downside to the new unit is nozzle storage. On the old one, it was a clamshell cover for the water cup that could contain a handful of different spray nozzles. In the new one, storage has been shifted to a small area between the water cup and main body, and it can only hold two nozzles. You then need to find a place to store the others if you think you might use them. I see them getting lost, but since I only work with the main spray nozzle and occasionally the flexible-tipped one, it&#x27;s not a huge problem.</li>
    <li> I really like the water flossed.</li>
    <li> My old one broke after about 10 years, so this is the replacement.  Here&#x27;s the best part about these waterpiks:  the two brush heads that clear around crowns and between teeth.  I haven&#x27;t had a cavity in years!</li>
    <li> Works well until 7 months later when it dies with no warning.</li>
    <li> Not So Good  I have been using waterpik water flossers for several years now and they do a good job on your oral hygiene.  The thing I have had issues with is that I have been through 2 of these and they seem to break at the same point.  The cradle that holds the flossser handle cracks so I cannot use it.  Just the other day the handle is actually coming apart.  So now I am faced with another purchase of a flosser.  I will not purchase this brand ever again.  Sorry to give a bad review but this is actually what has happened.</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD! IT IS GOOD~</li>
    <li> This is a great investment on yourself. If you have dental work such as bridges and implants, this makes flossing so much more enjoyable.</li>
    <li> Works great and easy to use. 4 ☆ because it is loud and takes up space.</li>
    <li> easy to use and keep clean</li>
    <li> best item for your buck! if i don&#x27;t use it for one day I feel like my mouth is not clean!</li>
    <li> Not overly impressed, mainly because the &amp;#34;on--off&amp;#34; button is VERY difficult to operate. I have to strain, to the point where it hurts my thumb, to turn it on and off. Not acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Lightfoot</li>
    <li> Thought all was great with this Waterpik until I saw how short the cord was.  I had the old version of the Waterpik and it sat it on my bathroom counter with no problem reaching the outllet.  Bought a portable version of the Waterpik after the first counter version died and had no problem with that cord reaching the outlet.  Decided I really needed a bigger water reservoir than the portable version so purchased this one.  This version comes and I was shocked that its electrical cord was shorter than prior versions and will now no longer reach the outlet.  Insane to think that the portable version has a longer cord (by six inches) than the countertop version.  Now in order to use it, I have to attach an extension cord!  UGH! Why couldnt they have kept the cord the same length.</li>
    <li> Works great. I love this product</li>
    <li> All I can say is WOW!! this thing is powerful, I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and still have only worked up to number 4 on the power level.  It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I agree that my teeth feel like they have been professionally cleaned when I use this. I have flossed daily my entire adult life, and now I just use this wonderful waterpik! I LOVE how clean my teeth feel on a daily basis!&lt;br /&gt;I actually bought it help my 7yo clean around his braces &amp; dental appliance. It made a HUGE mess when I tried to use it on him. He is using it by himself. He cleans his teeth like a 7 year old so there is some room for improvement. However, that is not a reflection of the product.</li>
    <li> It works great and has already improved my dental hygiene within weeks.</li>
    <li> Much better than I thought; really does a good flossing job!</li>
    <li> WOW! Amazing! This product will definitely help you have a better dental visit! Your hygienist will praise your attention to your gums!&lt;br /&gt;And it makes your mouth feel cleaner and refreshing!</li>
    <li> Had one years ago, but it wore out.  NIce to have one again!</li>
    <li> Almost like having your dentist use their waterpik, its that good</li>
    <li> I liked this product, but I found it from another brand, well but i compact and efficient.</li>
    <li> It is a little noisy but works great!</li>
    <li> Awesome!! I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas, and we love it. He let me try one of the multiple tips this product comes with, and I don&#x27;t think I could ever go back to regular flossing. This makes your mouth feel fresh and clean without the annoyingness of actual floss.</li>
    <li> This wonderful product has really improved my oral hygiene. Quicker and more comprehensive than flossing. A little loud, but an amazing value for the price.</li>
    <li> My husband swears by this waterpik flosser! He&#x27;s used it for approximately 8 months now and says it has vastly improved the health of his teeth! He says it&#x27;s easy to use and perfect for anyone who wants to ensure their teeth get super clean, have build-up, and/or hate flossing. His dentist even commented on the difference. And you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> This device provides a fairly powerful stream of water.  I&#x27;ve had the cordless version and this version (corded).  Better performance with the corded version.  The footprint is fairly small.  Several different settings but I like the most powerful and constant stream.</li>
    <li> Works like how it should. Unlike it&#x27;s predecessor this one does not have any storage compartment for the heads.</li>
    <li> Our cordless water pik stopped working. This one is larger but so much more powerful. First model that really removed food particles from a full appliance over implants (top and bottom). Have to use a lower speed in order to avoid injuring gums.</li>
    <li> I havent really explored all of the extensions, so I cant give a legit review, but I like it.!!!</li>
    <li> So far it works as advertised. Pressure is great, tried a few different tips, they all perform as expected. Haven&#x27;t found anything with the unit that would make me question the purchase.</li>
    <li> Works well. Gets to those difficult spots between teeth with ease. I have not tried all the attachments yet, but I am sure they will work just fine.</li>
    <li> It is as advertised.  Works well.  Delivered on time.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Packaging on made in China, and two years warranty. But the official website of China does not recognise bought abroad, especially is that the voltage is 110 v, so worried about the bad can&#x27;t repair.</li>
    <li> Great product, as expected. Quality quality quality....I just wish a silent version could be made. Now that would be perfect!</li>
    <li> This product is so awesome for dental health. I preferred the old design, but this works fine as well.</li>
    <li> Over rated - bit clumsy to use.</li>
    <li> does not turn on and in addition, received item after return date. Stuck with a broken waterpik.</li>
    <li> exactly as described, fast shipper</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd flosser that I have purchased.  Use it a couple times a day.  Dental exams are a breeze, and no need to use dental floss string ever again.  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> This Waterpik is every bit as good as I had hoped. Works perfectly, keeps my gums healthy. It&#x27;s loud-ish, but not to the point of problem. Took a few uses before I got coordinated and stopped spraying myself. But that is also not a problem. I&#x27;m not above learning how to use an appliance. The wand fits perfectly into its holder. A bonus: It looks more attractive than the picture. I&#x27;m all-around delighted.</li>
    <li> This is my first waterpik and I LOVE it. It cleans your teeth without brushing (of course you still should brush them). It fits in small places and looks nice on a counter top. SOOOOO worth the investment!</li>
    <li> This was a great buy.  Not expensive and it works very well.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Before I use to clean my teeth feel a really big effect.&lt;br /&gt;If this is your first time to use the hydraulic strongly felt, but it is now in use to match the 8 or so.&lt;br /&gt;Dental floss, but difficult to use narrow spacing between the teeth This product does not have to worry about.&lt;br /&gt;In particular, the effect is larger after I eat meat.</li>
    <li> The idea is great and generous but the one that I got was not so great. The water pressure was lower than expected and it leaked at times. So I sent it back and bought the Ultra model instead, which came with the second device, a smaller version for travel. So for just $15 more I got two devices and twice the corresponding heads. Ultra model seems better than this one.</li>
    <li> The motor on this thing is really loud. The pulsing thing is a bit weird, but I guess it&#x27;s there for a reason. I kind of wish there was an option to have the water come out in a normal flow instead of the pulsing action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it works fine as a water flosser. The pressure is a little weak (I&#x27;m not sure why anyone would use a setting lower than 8, and 10 doesn&#x27;t seem like overkill), but the higher settings work fine.</li>
    <li> Has multiple controls and does everything as advertised</li>
    <li> My son wanted this because he was having trouble flossing with his new braces on.  He likes it.  Will be returning to the orthodontist this week, hopefully the Waterpik Flosser did a good job.  Water pressure is powerful and adjustable.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my fiance. He loves it. I&#x27;ve tried it too, there are extra nozzles with color coding that can be changed for each person. Gets the gunk out, good gum massage, and teeth feel smooth and like new afterwards.</li>
    <li> Bleeding blood when flossing 1st week, and get better and better, and stop bleeding now.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that I have to transfer voltage from 220V to 120V.</li>
    <li> waterpik worked ok but found that the on/off switch is very hard to switch on and off</li>
    <li> Just received ours.  It was used.  Quality seal broken.  Plastic torn open.  Freaking disgusting.  Ordered replacement so hopefully it will be new.  Quality control at Amazon definitely seems to be lacking.</li>
    <li> my daughter ordered it since she has difficulty flossing her teeth.  Turns out this product was way harder to use!  The water sprayed all over the bathroom and it was hard for her to push the button to the on and off positions.  I had difficulty too; it is hard to push into place.  It just didn&#x27;t match up to it&#x27;s description.</li>
    <li> my teeth are in the best condition in years. i can not wait until my next check up</li>
    <li> This item was purchased as a Christmas gift. Not for my own use</li>
    <li> Diabetic senior citizen with hate for flossing - BUT NOT NOW!  I love this thing since I&#x27;ve learned to use it.  Simple instructions even a stroke patient learned to floss!  I do give credit to my spouse for having patience to help me master this.  It&#x27;s a please to feel such clean teeth.  (I keep the pressure at 1 and it works great!) WARNING: DO NOT USE IN SHOWER!</li>
    <li> Nice waterpik, the only problem that I have is that the switch on the handle is extremely difficult to push on or push off. Maybe I just got one that is stiff and not moving well, I am not sure.  My only hesitation to ordering this model is the handle switch.  Hopefully in the future they have a better method of turning off and on, like maybe a larger switch, or just easier to move the switch.  Other than that, this is an excellent machine to use at home.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it, does just what she wants</li>
    <li> I owned the small portable one but I love this one with the cord and a smaller unit to hold while I floss.</li>
    <li> It works and very pleased with it</li>
    <li> It can clean the teeth, but noisy, was i using wrongly?</li>
    <li> My wife and I are very happy with this device.  They&#x27;ve been around for many years, but I never thought I&#x27;d want (or need) one before.  On our last visit to the dentist, the hygienist suggested to my wife that a Waterpik would make a difference in her gum line inflammation.  We&#x27;ve not been back for checkups yet, but it &#x27;feels&#x27; like it&#x27;s working well.  Not sure that it&#x27;s a replacement for flossing, as there isn&#x27;t any &#x27;mechanical&#x27; contact, but it does blast any food particles from between your teeth and probably from in the gum line too.  Can be a little sloppy to use, need to be leaned down close to the sink, as obviously the water from your mouth has to go somewhere.  I&#x27;m over six feet, and if I don&#x27;t pay attention to how far I&#x27;m bent over, water will end up running down my arm and drip off my elbow... and need to make sure you keep it aimed into your mouth.  Seems like a simple thing, but it&#x27;s easy to get it twisted and shoot water around the bathroom.  Not an issue at all, and sometimes it&#x27;s rather funny!</li>
    <li> I should have purchased this machine years ago!</li>
    <li> Seems like a great product. My Dentist recommended it, and I&#x27;m just getting used to how to use it. I think in another month my rating might be  5 stars? But so far, so good.</li>
    <li> Works like the old one that it replaced. Easier to fill, and like the tips of the implement better too. A good purchase at a good price from this seller.</li>
    <li> Pretty cool. Does the job.  Can get messy if you are not careful but that&#x27;s part of the deal.</li>
    <li> Quick ship. Works great.</li>
    <li> used it few times, works great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll caveat this review by stating that this is my first waterpik so I do not have anything to compare this to. It works well, but I&#x27;m a little disappointed with how stiff the on off button is on the wand. Its been a struggle to switch it off without making a mess... still practicing. The other item that disappoints me is how loud the motor is... this thing sounds like a jack hammer in a small bathroom. Wakes up the house if I use it early in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll like using the pik but I will likely start looking for a device that is a bit a easier to use and quieter.</li>
    <li> Great. Easy to use, teeth feel really clean.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave one to my grandson, but it does not fit over his wash basin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it have a wall attachment?</li>
    <li> Does a great job of cleaning between my teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> I like it - a little lightweight - but for the price does a good job. My dentist recommended it.</li>
    <li> fast shiped&lt;br /&gt;A low price&lt;br /&gt;Satisfaction&lt;br /&gt;very safe delivery</li>
    <li> I had one that was a hand held one as a kid with braces. This is great with the tank. Doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of counter space and makes my teeth feel fresh from the dentist clean</li>
    <li> I like this product very attractive . Bye.</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT,SHOULD SAVE ME TRIP&#x27;S TO DENTIST!</li>
    <li> . After hearing about Teflon type chemicals on some floss, I decided to finally purchase an irrigator.  After reading reviews, I decided on the Waterpik brand. I usually have the setting at about 3/4 of the way, 7 or 8, which is powerful enough to get the water between the teeth. The process is fairly straightforward and insructions are clear. This combined with Nature&#x27;s Answer Periocleanse added to the water tank, makes my mouth feel very clean and fresh.  I&#x27;ve only used the standard attachment so far ( there are 2 of them so my husband and I both get one, and oddly enough, they fit onto tiny raised plastic pieces on the back of my Phillips Sonicare electric toothbbush )</li>
    <li> Wow, this thing works wonders if you have a plaque problem like myself. Great little machine just remember to keep your mouth shut or you&#x27;ll have a unexpected bath!!</li>
    <li> well worth the money. I f you don&#x27;t like flossing and it gets to you, this is the thing for you.</li>
    <li> My teeth felt really clean.I must tell you I had to get use to using it without having water every where.  Now I can say I am past making such a mess.I would recommend to everyone.  I was surprised to see how much my tooth brush missed.</li>
    <li> I have a this, a Water Pik Ultra and am OraTec Viajet Pro. They are in different locations. They all work fine. Some have different features, but they all do the job. I wish I could say that there was The One that is just awesome, but really, they are just water flossers. When the OraTec goes, I will not be replacing it. It&#x27;s pretty fragile and clogs easily. I like the Water Pik brand. It&#x27;s reliable. This particular one has more features than is necessary to get clean teeth, but if that is important to you, go for it. I like that this one is light weight. That and the shape of it make it easier to travel with. I am into basic functions so this works fine for me. So does the Ultra with fewer features and a lower price tag. It seems reliable so far and does the job.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the waterpik.I use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;Was pleased with the price.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Its hard to turn it off and it is messy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a much more expensive version of a water flosser for a few years, and it&#x27;s starting to have problems. I jumped at the chance to try this new model from Waterpik, and I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waterpik has made guessing unnecessary -- it \\&quot;pauses\\&quot; every thirty seconds to help you pace yourself. You get a good assortment of tips -- 3 \\&quot;regular\\&quot; tips and 4 \\&quot;specialty\\&quot; tips. I&#x27;ve had periodontal disease and treatments (mine were laser -- not cheap), and I want to avoid that again if possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, a very nice unit at a decent price.</li>
    <li> I had been using the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser for a few years now. I had bought that one in 2011 when I got my braces put on, since it makes flossing soo much easier. I really thought it was one of the best inventions ever, so I was excited to give this Aquarius model a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the few improvements/differences on this Aquarius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that the lid is hinged and just lifts up and down. On the Ultra, the lid came totally off and it was cumbersome to place back on the water basin without one end falling in the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the clear water basin, as opposed to the blue, It just looks nicer  - nice and crystal clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body overall is slightly smaller and takes up a little less space on the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the look of the pressure control and the power buttons on the Aquarius better than the Ultra. The power button is a push button instead of a rocker, and it just seems more modern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flow control on the handle sort of adds an extra step when you want to pause flossing and stop the water flow momentarily. On the Ultra, you just hold the button in and release when you&#x27;re ready to start back up. In the Aquarius though it is actually a slide switch, so you actually turn the flow off and on. I like the button the Ultra a little better, but that may just be because I am used to it... using the button before was force of habit and I just kind if did it as needed without even thinking about it and I catch myself trying to just press that button and then have to stop and remember  - new machine, different button. It is not a complaint though. It is still plenty easy to control the flow. It&#x27;s just different than what I have been used to for the past several years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plenty of different tips are included to address any need you may have. I actually only ever use the orthodontic tip because that is what felt like worked best for me with my braces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are debating whether a Waterpik is a good investment or not, I can tell you without a doubt that it is a GREAT investment, especially if you have braces. It is so much easier to maintain my braces and keep them and my teeth clean. I tend to get spaces in my teeth as they shift from the braces. The gum will actually separate from the tooth a little and food gets down in there and sort of compacts as I am eating. The Waterpik gets all of that pout for me. When I skip a day or two of using the Waterpik, I end up with sore gums and particles down in there. I really try to use it every day, but we all get a little lazy every now and then, right? Brushing alone just isn&#x27;t enough though, of course, and the Waterpik is better than flossing with string, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can tell my teeth and gums are much healthier with using the Waterpik. I am a smoker, so I always had a little more builup, but using the flosser gets me much better reviews with the dental hygienist during my cleanings and checkups. My orthodontist has even said that my gums look better since I started using it. I feel good about that and I do not think I will ever stop using it.Waterpik is a good investment or not, I can tell you without a doubt that it is a GREAT investment, especially if you have braces.

    <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted a full-sized Waterpik but had to settle for smaller travel-sized versions because of non-existent counterspace.  My current/previous dental irrigator is a travel Panasonic model that has only one type of tip and a a barely adjustable flow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have actual bathroom counter space, I can have and enjoy using a real oral irrigator.  I love how there is a larger liquid capacity, different tips to clean more thoroughly and of course a handy little place to store all those tips in the lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this Waterpik and would not hesitate to buy it at MSRP.  I have no other experience with this brand&#x27;s other products or other full-sized oral irrigators so cannot compare.</li>
    <li> LOVE it; don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ve done without one all these years.  Going to buy another one for my kids to share (it comes with multiple tips).  Highly recommend!  Now I can&#x27;t wait for my next dental cleaning to see if my hygienist notices a difference.</li>
    <li> I purchased a WP-100 back in 2008 that has served me very well over the years, but it was time for something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The WP-660 has some nice new features, but takes away some that I&#x27;m going to miss from my older Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Among the new features is the mode switch which allows you to switch between massage and floss. One thing I like is the timer when you&#x27;re in floss mode, but I don&#x27;t care for the pause between cycles. It&#x27;s kind of disconcerting and vaguely annoying. I&#x27;d prefer a plain beep instead. The head now has a ratcheting feature so it doesn&#x27;t rotate so easily, but it&#x27;s almost too strong and makes it hard to smoothly change the angle of the tip. The older model didn&#x27;t have anything like that and at times seemed to move a bit too easily. So this one is a net improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The water tank at the top holds about 90 seconds worth of water which is great, but the top no longer allows a way of storing the collection of ends, which is a net loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most annoying change is the switch on the handle for stopping the flow of water. It&#x27;s hard to manipulate and the design of the WP-100 is much easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The WP-600 is a fine product and will likely serve you well over the years, but it would have been nice if they hadn&#x27;t made it harder to use than the older WP-100</li>
    <li> The Waterpik Water Flosser has a problem with it as the pick seems to come out more often than it stays in.  For that reason, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I bought this.... I absolutely love the way the water feels in my mouth&lt;br /&gt;I would like ther to be storage for the other picks in the unit</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1GFD1DUOD3AR7]]When my dentist made me a bridge, she recommended to me to get a dental water jet system for cleaning - a Waterpik.  Ordinary floss will no longer do the job as it cannot squeeze in between my new teeth.  Not very familiar at that time about what a Waterpik is, I went to do my research and bought Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser.  That was 3 years ago, now I have this new Waterpik Aquarius model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It occupies a small footprint.  The jet has 10 power settings just like the older model.  For my preference, I think 1 to 3 is weak, while 8 to 10 is too strong, so I stay right in the middle.  I recommend to start by using the number 3 setting and adjust the knob as it suits you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a number of differences from the older model.&lt;br /&gt;a) The Aquarius is more compact (although sacrificing a space for the accessories that used to be on the lid of the water reservoir - now you would need to find a place for the other tips. I put mine in the medicine cabinet). There is still a place for two extra tips; it is now located directly inside the water tank.&lt;br /&gt;b) The addition of the gum massage button and LED.&lt;br /&gt;c) Neutral colors provides better aesthetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water tank:&lt;br /&gt;I filled the older water tank with water and then pour it to the water tank of the new Aquarius.  It may look that the older model has more capacity but I found out they are just the same.  The new tank has a smaller footprint but is taller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- as with the older model, the water comes out of the tip if you forget to place it back on the hook.  This sometimes happen with the kids and have a pool of water by the side of the sink or on the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is missing?&lt;br /&gt;- an ultrasonic vibration action that is present on my Interplak water dental jet system&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are multiple attachments included. Changing between tips is very quick with the switch near the base for a quick release.  Our favorite is the brush, unfortunately there is only one provided.  The others are the regular classic flossers (3), a pick-pocket etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a dental bridge, I really will not be able to clean my teeth as thorough without a water jet.  Not only it cleans the teeth, it also massage the gums.  Of course if somebody in the family has a brace, this flosser is a must.  It makes cleaning teeth more fun, specially for the kids Comparing the old and the new,  I really don&#x27;t have a favorite between the two.  I am happy with either one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: This is also great for cleaning small things thats that are impossible to reach. Good example are jewelries, sippy cups that has rubber parts,, etc.unfortunately there is only one provided.

    <li> This is not my first unit as I have been using them for forty years, curiously no new cavities.  I go many years between filling replacements and have many 40 year old fillings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike floss which drives food scraps into the gums, this blows them free.  I blew a loose filling out once, so I only clean the sides of my teeth, I rarely use floss as it seems less effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mechanically:&lt;br /&gt;1. This unit is a bit smaller ant the tank is easier to remove an reinstall - the tank must be dried after every use and all other water removed, tho unit is easier to remove as it doesn&#x27;t stick on like the last design.  We have calcium here which is a mess if allowed to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2, Pump reservoir seems smaller, warm water is pumped very fast - gone is the cold water &amp;#34;gottcha&amp;#34;  of the previous units.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  The big deal -  My last two units failed at the feed tube attachment to the handle - they made a stress relief tip on the handle at the break point - I am hoping for added life.  Even if that does not happen, it makes storing the handle easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. I have tried other brands - not enough pressure to do the job.  I like max pressure for a quick effective cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  I like the new touch controls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.  It is not at all  obvious how they can ever improve this device.</li>
    <li> These waterpik devices really are a lot better than floss.  I have no trouble cleaning out food traps and cleaning beneath bridgework with this.  As a bonus, you can use the device to clean other objects as well that have small crevasses.  I have used it to clean my CPAP humidifier reservoir and my sonicare toothbrush- all with out having to touch the material being cleaned so the pik tip stays clean.</li>
    <li> 1. A little bite noise&lt;br /&gt;2. Lithium chargeable battery equipped is better&lt;br /&gt;3. A direct quick connected to water supply tap instead of water container is better</li>
    <li> Either I got one of these are false teeth were in order! lol.  My Dentist got on my butt a few months ago and suggested this item.  My mouth and gums were never cleaner.  Its so easy to use and only takes 30 min of your time!  In fact I went back for another visit for a deep cleaning of my teeth/gums, and she (my dentist) said she could see the difference this made.  Im very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I agonized about the rating to give this product.  On the one hand, I loved it for the two months it worked.  During the first two months, I discovered that it was easy to use and effective.  After just six weeks&#x27; use, my dentist&#x27;s hygienist commented on noticeably improved gum conditions.  Unfortunately, at the end of that two month period the pump suddenly lost 2/3 of its pressure and it is now useless.  I may buy another because I liked it so much and hope that the one I received was an anomaly.</li>
    <li> Great item to add to your dental care. Makes your mouth feel really clean and fresh. I can&#x27;t believe how much I like this&lt;br /&gt;Item. Don&#x27;t delay! Order this TODAY.</li>
    <li> Does an awesome job of cleaning your mouth and the vestiges of what you&#x27;ve eaten...leaves it fresh.</li>
    <li> I love how this makes my teeth and mouth feel. It is a great tool to keep my teeth healthy.</li>
    <li> Recommended by orthodontist after braces put on. Works well. Nice to add mouthwash.</li>
    <li> I like this flosser better than the older model we had. There are some great features, such as the on/off button on the handheld. It stores easier than the last one we had, too.</li>
    <li> Item leaks!!! There is leakage from the bottom of the handle right where the water hose enters. Unfortunately I was unable to use the item right away, since I was out of town when the package arrived. By the time I opened the Waterpik to try it out, the warranty from Amazon had expired and I was unable to return it.</li>
    <li> Very user friendly, with multiple attachments.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this product. It does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to do. It cleans under my bridge and between teeth like a pro! Definitely would recommend!</li>
    <li> it works very well. Smaller than I expected. On/off button very stiff to work.</li>
    <li> My third waterpik..this is the best yet..they are getting smaller and more powerful...</li>
    <li> I had some problems at the beginning with getting the sliding button on the pick to work but other than that I&#x27;ve enjoyed using the product and feel it has enhanced my oral hygiene very much.</li>
    <li> this was recommended by my dentist it seems to be a very good product  definitely Cleans the plaque from between your teeth&lt;br /&gt;I do think It does better than dental floss I am 100% satisfied seems to be a quality made product I would definitely recommend this&lt;br /&gt;to anyone who is interested in a Water Pik for their teeth</li>
    <li> This is not a well designed piece of equipment. It is a piece of (s&#x27; you know what). It is almost impossible to turn of the water spray.&lt;br /&gt;THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE EASYIST THING TO DO!!!! On and on it goes as you try to get the thing pointed in the right direction.</li>
    <li> Wand very difficult to turn on and off. I have to keep it on all the time and use power button instead. Older model had much better wand control. Otherwise works well.</li>
    <li> great product, I end up using only one brush head. you don&#x27;t have to use too many. , next time I would choose the product cost less water.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it, uses it everyday, great product</li>
    <li> Easy to use, clean and very effective ... especially if you are wearing braces.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past two weeks and i&#x27;m very happy with it.  It&#x27;s not too noisy, but you might wanna close the bathroom door anyway just to make sure you are&#x27;t waking anyone in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This water pick works well.  It does what it claims to do and even on a level eight setting it&#x27;s comfortable.</li>
    <li> Good size for small spaces, we don&#x27;t have a lot of room and I was concerned when ordering it. I was pleasantly surprised - clean and petite design&lt;br /&gt;It works great a bit noisy but I don&#x27;t have prior reference using another water floser.</li>
    <li> Only complaint is the on-off button on the handle is VERY difficult to use.</li>
    <li> Cleans and flosses gently with water.</li>
    <li> Does the job without hurting the gums</li>
    <li> I very much like the sleek design of the WP-660 in comparison to the old model I replaced. Don&#x27;t remember the model # of my old one but it was awkward and bulky in contrast to the new one. They both did a wonderful job and I would have given the 660 a five star rating if the water on/off switch would be easier to operate. Had a very difficult time turning it on the first time but now that I have used it a few times, it is becoming somewhat more comfortable. Will definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Works well.  It would be nice to have different colored tips for different users and also would be nice if it had a place to store the tips.</li>
    <li> Very good machine for the price ....</li>
    <li> This item was received on time and met our expectations.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> An excellent water flosser.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best thing I have ever used for oral hygiene. I highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised, it does a better job than floss.</li>
    <li> I was looking at the potential for costly treatments for my gums. In my case, this flosser solved my problems.</li>
    <li> Keeps the dentist  away</li>
    <li> While this seemed to have enough water force, the on/off button on the wand stuck from the get go. My friend had the same problem with hers.</li>
    <li> I bought this two months ago and noticed that occasionally it leaves food particles between the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, I went to the dentist today and he said this is NOT a substitute for the traditional flossing thread. This water pik can be used to remove particles of food stuck somewhere in the teeth, but is NOT a substitute for traditional flossing. Traditional flossing thread removes stuff by mechanically moving and rubbing between the teeth. Water cannot replace that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is useless to me. Because regular flossing (with the floss thread), is the what my dentist has asked me to do.</li>
    <li> it is good,but if it used in China,I have to buy a  step up/ step down transformer</li>
    <li> I love the feeling of my mouth and gums after using.  I am hoping to improve my gums to eliminate any further developments.</li>
    <li> was easy to use did exactly what I need to clean deeper in the gum area</li>
    <li> I have mailed the product more than 3 weeks and still no progress update.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Good item, good price.</li>
    <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner.  Works well with the right amount of pressure possible.</li>
    <li> Better than brushing when it comes to removing lodged food particle.  I definitely recommend this as a lot easier than conventional flossing.</li>
    <li> So far, works great. Is nice and compact!</li>
    <li> My new best friend. Not crazy about flossing but like this a lot. Took a couple times to not soak myself as I am apparently directionally challenged but after that haven&#x27;t had a problem. Use it several times a day when I am home as I like the way it feels on my gums and it seems to dislodge any stuck pieces between teeth.</li>
    <li> It is light weight. Powerful , better than the old one they have. This is a new model.</li>
    <li> WORKS WELL - BUT HAVE TO GET USE TO SQUIRTING MYSELF IN THE FACE...SATISFIED</li>
    <li> Works perfectly and as advertised.</li>
    <li> Excellent water pik, flosser, massager, I bout one for my husband and he actually uses it!</li>
    <li> Great!  just what the dentist suggested</li>
    <li> I own the Air Floss from another company (okay), but this is amazing. I love the gum massage feature. I actually think this product is better than regular flossing for 90% of time. However, there will be times when food will be stuck and string require string flossing. Make sure you close your mouth just enough so the water doesn&#x27;t go all over the bathroom. I use level 10 (max) for the massage feeling. I like it rough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: This unit leaked on me after 6 months from the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;Update (1/21/16): Water Pik promptly replaced the unit. I&#x27;m back to enjoying my water flossing and now highly recommend it to friends and families.</li>
    <li> I like the way my mouth feels after I use this water flosser.</li>
    <li> In every way satisfactory.  KH</li>
    <li> I have used the Waterpik Ultra off-and-on for the last for the last four or five years. I like using it, but it seems to leave pools of water and it is a bit rough on my gums. The Waterpik Professional is very similar, but it easy to fill the reservoir and seems to be gentler on my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - Try to use warm water - if you have sensitive teeth jet of cold water will really hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - Includes multiple tips&lt;br /&gt;  - One toothbrush water jet tip&lt;br /&gt;  - Multiple standard tips&lt;br /&gt;  - One tip for dental implants&lt;br /&gt;  - One tip for braces&lt;br /&gt;  - One Pik Pocket Tip for getting things between your teeth (only to be used on the lowest settings)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The tips can be swapped out very easily - even by younger children&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Has a *Massage&amp;#34; mode that shoots water in short bursts - but I am not fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It seems quieter than the Waterpik Ultra&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Has a dial for water pressure settings - however even at the highest settings it doesn&#x27;t seem to be too harsh on your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Has a relatively long cord - at least four feet in length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I do wish that it had a spot to hold all of the different attachments&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Verdict - I can&#x27;t say that the WaterPik is substantial improvement over the Waterpik Ultra. It seems like the Waterpik Professional has a bit less power that its predecessor but it seems to be better designed and less likely to create pools of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 1/2 Stars</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve a huge fan of Waterpik. Several years ago, when my dentist told me I had the beginnings of periodontal disease, I rushed out and got a Waterpik. I&#x27;ve been religiously using it ever since, and I&#x27;ve beaten back the periodontal disease to the point where my dentist is impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My older Waterpik still works fine, but I was anxious to try this newer version. I frankly don&#x27;t see what the improvements are that justify the higher cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s certainly prettier and more countertop worthy than my older standby. This one is taller, and the reservoir holds basically the same amount of water. This one is more glitzy with the LED stuff, and it makes the older model look quaint (but my view is that the more high tech stuff is, the more likely it is to break, and not be repairable.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pressure settings feel about the same. I use the 8 setting on the older model; this one feels slightly more rough, but that could just be because it&#x27;s so new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Aquarius also has a gum massage thing going on (and I don&#x27;t get the point of that, unless you wanna have pinky gums right before you go to the dentist.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, it works fine, but I don&#x27;t see a vast amount of difference - except in the price. Of course, that could just be because we&#x27;re in an inflation death spiral right now, so something that cost $40 a few years ago is now hitting $100. Overall, I don&#x27;t think a few bells and whistles aren&#x27;t worth double the price. But having said that, I do think anyone over the age of 30 (and certainly over 40) who wants to keep their teeth should make a Waterpik investment. It&#x27;s one of the few things that really works to preserve your dental health.</li>
    <li> This product exceeded my expectations. It&#x27;s easy to use picks and the choices for the speed pump is excellent. I rate this 5 stars.</li>
    <li> The waterpik is great.  the only problem was that it is 110 Volt, while in Israel we have 220 Volt.&lt;br /&gt;Luckily I had a transformer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best regards Ralto</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an adult with braces (recently hit my 2 year mark) and have been using a Waterpik WP-100 a.k.a the Waterpik Ultra water flosser for the entire time I&#x27;ve had my braces. Like many folks who wear braces I found that using traditional cleansing techniques was both extremely time consuming and still left food particles in my braces. The Waterpik came recommended by my dentist and orthodontist. So I jumped at the opportunity to try the WP-660.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------&lt;br /&gt;DESIGN:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The WP-660 is very similar to my WP-100. Both feature a water reservoir, hose connected wand attachment with interchangeable cleaning heads. The major changes between the two seem to be color; the WP-660 is entirely white with a clear reservoir. The wand itself on the 660 has a toggle for controlling the water stream instead of a button that required depressing on my WP-100. The WP-660 also features a massaging feature (controlled on the main body instead of the wand) not present on the WP-100.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strangely the 660 is missing the tool compartment for storing all the different cleaning attachments that my WP-100 has. This was a compartment dome that fit inside the lid of the reservoir. Additionally there is not included storage case of any type. Meaning that if you switch between cleaning heads you&#x27;re going to have to store your attachments somewhere of your own choosing or purchase a storage case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The WP-660 despite being a more expensive than my older 100-series also feels a bit more cheaply constructed. The plastics, particularly on the reservoir and lid feel cheaper and less durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------&lt;br /&gt;USE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Functionally both the 660 and 100-series are very similar. I use the orthodontic-tip attachment most because of my braces and can easily withstand the stream from the WP-100 even at it&#x27;s highest setting (10). That is not the case with the 660 and the water stream feels considerably stronger. In fact the manual for the 660 specifically points out not to use the highest water pressure setting for cleaning teeth. The massage feature is the other major change in the 660 and actually find it quite nice after thoroughly cleaning my teeth with the orthodontic-tip attachment. The massage feature essentially pulses water and helps promote gum health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the 660 and the 100 are loud but in different ways. I found the pitch of the WP-100 sounded more high-pitched, almost like a whine; and in the 660 it sounds lower, almost like a engine. Bottom-line is that neither is a quiet device though I found that I quickly adjusted to hearing it while cleaning my teeth in the same way that I adjusted to hearing my electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Similarly both devices are about the same size. Each takes up considerable real-estate on my bathroom counter but has become an indispensable part of my hygiene routine that it&#x27;s worth the small inconvenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------&lt;br /&gt;WHAT I LIKE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(+) The same cleaning action of my older WP-100 \\&quot;Ultra\\&quot; model with a little extra power and increased water pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(+) For a person with braces having a Waterpik is a must. This little device along with brushing and flossing will leave your mouth feeling clean. It&#x27;s also perfect for quick rinses after eating foods when you don&#x27;t have time for a full cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(+) Neat, clean aesthetics. The device looks good, stores easily and is easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------&lt;br /&gt;WHAT I DON&#x27;T LIKE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(-) The WP-660 is, like its predecessor, extremely loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(-) No included on-board storage for attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(-) Cheaper feeling plastics compared to the WP-100. Hopefully the cost savings that Waterpik implemented doesn&#x27;t carry over to the internal components of 660.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(-) Besides the massage feature and increased water pressure there&#x27;s little reason to purchase the WP-660 over the WP-100.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------&lt;br/&gt;CONCLUSION:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The WP-660 is a decent, well-featured water flosser. However, compared to the cheaper WP-100 Ultra there&#x27;s little reason to spend the extra money. Recommended, but also check out the WP-100 to see if that fits your needs first!/&gt;CONCLUSION:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The WP-660 is a decent, well-featured water flosser. However, compared to the cheaper WP-100 Ultra there&#x27;s little reason to spend the extra money. Recommended, but also check out the WP-100 to see if that fits your needs first!</li>
    <li> If you have never used one of thee they are awesome.  Great warranty,this comes with all of the tips.  I got it for my son&#x27;s braces, but I have come to love it as well.</li>
    <li> The best product I bought this year!</li>
    <li> This is a great water flosser.  Very convenient to use and really cleans teeth.  I was skeptical at first so I would go over my teeth with string floss to see if it really got every thing and for the most part it does.</li>
    <li> Great product! Works very well. Only con is its a loud product, very loud...nevertheless  worth the money!</li>
    <li> My teeth have never felt better</li>
    <li> I think its okay, but the on off switch gets stuck all of the time and is hard to turn on.</li>
    <li> Ordered 4 - one for everyone in the house - as per dentist&#x27;s orders.  It is wonderful!</li>
    <li> Complete piece of junk product. Within one year the garbage plastic tube started leaking water all over the counter. I normally fill the tank so that the temperature of the water is room temp and easier on the gums. I now find a water puddle on my counter.&lt;br /&gt;The design of the hose where it enters into the handle is completely poorly designed and engineered. It&#x27;s essentially a disposable part that is designed to fail.&lt;br /&gt; I had a competitive product that never broke or gave me any trouble for 10 years! I would highly recommend a Hydrofloss over this POS product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I went to order the replacement part to fix the leak. Amazon&#x27;s price is more than twice as much as buying it from Waterpik. So, even with shipping I ordered from Waterpik. Well, their ordering system sucks as bad as their product. Once you place the order, there is no confirmation page that actually tells you: Hey, thanks for your order.. Confirmed.. Nope.. No such talent at this company. So, I ended up with 2 orders. Just now I spent 30 minutes on the phone to cancel one of the two.. I don&#x27;t like their product or their quality, nor I like their website&#x27;s ordering system.</li>
    <li> Button/slide on the handle is hard to move with one hand. The button on the base is located in a strange place. It is hard to reach for it to turn it off and when there is no more water in the reservoir, all Flosser moves when you are trying to push it.&lt;br /&gt;The flossing job and gums massage are very good however. Best I tried (Sonicare, previous three models of the Waterpik).&lt;br /&gt;It is going to be my friend for 2-3 years until Waterpik redesigns the Flosser or another brand will beat competition</li>
    <li> Great product.  As advertised</li>
    <li> Very happy with how unit works and the results from its use.</li>
    <li> A little sloppy to use, but well worth it. Does an excellent job of cleaning below the gums. Use it nightly and dental hygienist said she could really tell the difference.</li>
    <li> I have used many Water Flossers from Waterpik before.  This one worked for one week and than just stopped pushing water into the hand held flossing device.  I will probably have to return it.  What a hassle.</li>
    <li> I definitely don&#x27;t like flossing like the next guy, though this is the definite future that is going to replace dental floss. It sounds like a power washer when it is turned on. You have to be careful when you first use it and get the hang of it. Since the first time you use it it sprays everywhere like a hose. Though this is a way less painful way of flossing your teeth. It seems when I use string dental floss it is a bigger pain (literally than the WaterPik. When you use this your mouth will feel refreshed. It is a definite winner in my book.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. As represented.  Lowest price I could find.  The best water pik for cleaning between the teeth and the gums.</li>
    <li> Waterpik Aquarius Professional Water Flosser&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a month into this, so I expect to either add a star or find that there&#x27;s a better brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: your mouth truly feels clean, and it fun watching the waterpik catch what the toothbrush didn&#x27;t.  Watch out for turning it on too high without easing into it for 5 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: You have to learn to balance cleaning your teeth without moving too abruptly and hurting other parts of your mouth. The water IS sharp.  It can make you bleed slightly just like dental floss can. Hurts like heck if you aim it on your tongue.</li>
    <li> For cleaning teeth daily it work fine. I just wish the water storage cup can hold&lt;br /&gt;more water than just 2 cups of water.</li>
    <li> very useful. It&#x27;s very comfortable after useing it.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Gift:  Says his gums have markedly improved.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly for me.</li>
    <li> It works for me.  I keep my teeth clean and get professional cleaning every 6 months.  The all white suits me.  The only problem I have is that it is too wide to fit in the medicine cabinet.  If I break off the brush holder, it would fit.  Don&#x27;t these companies know that some of us don&#x27;t want ugly appliances visible?</li>
    <li> Works great.  Really surprised at how much gunk it removed from my teeth after I brushed them with my ultrasonic toothbrush</li>
    <li> Bought one for my daughter who wears an expander.  She is able to use it by herself with no problem</li>
    <li> Not worth the hassle. Nice  tool but very messy. Save your money and use some floss.</li>
    <li> Great product. So much easier to use than string floss, and it really is gentle around the bridge work.  Looking for a good water pik?, try this one.</li>
    <li> Best water pik I have ever owned</li>
    <li> The maximum pressure on this device is less than on my previous standard Water-Pik and the water reservoir is 40% smaller.  Water-Pik is adding unnecessary frills by separating “flossing” from “gum massage” and having you change tips for each function – a waste of time. I wish I had bought the classic Water-Pik which both flosses and massages gums – how can you not massage the gums? – at the same time.</li>
    <li> Just what my dentist said i needed. Works real good. Easy to use</li>
    <li> Works only with 110V. I traveled to Europe with it, I plugged it to 220V. It is useless, now! I have a Oral-B power toothbrush and shaving machine that both say that it is for 110V but work great with both 110V and 220V. That is why I plugged Waterpik to 220V.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to have a waterpik ultra water flosser. I think it was much larger, but fells solid!! It seems that Aquaris has smaller water tank than the ultra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has more tips, but does not include the tongue cleaner.</li>
    <li> A high Quality product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this. Had it a couple months. I think it is great.</li>
    <li> This has completely changed my oral hygiene. My teeth have never felt so clean. It&#x27;s easy to clean and I love all the different attachments.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been going through water piks way too quickly.  I might have a winner here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, this does not in any way, shape, or form replace flossing.  I use POH floss (buypoh dot com).  The water &amp;#34;flosser&amp;#34; is just for removing bits of food between crowded teeth.  Rinsing, swishing, brushing (Sonicare), brush-picking, flossing don&#x27;t do the trick for me.  Gotta have a water pik.  I disagree with the term &amp;#34;water flosser.&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s a water pik and does not floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice unit with a 3-year warranty.  The reservoir comes out easily and it grabs whatever is necessary when putting back on.  No pushing it down to make it grab.  Put it back, turn it on, and out comes the water.  I like that the lid is not part of the reservoir.  My last garbage water pik, I dropped the reservoir and the lid cracked off.  The lid is part of the machine, so you cover it when you&#x27;re using the unit and obviously when it&#x27;s resting.  And there are holes in the lid so that it seems to air out and no thought of getting maybe moldy.  I shake the reservoir &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; before putting it back and the holes in the lid seem to keep it &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; or something like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using the unit at 8.  The highest is 10.  I use 10 when I fill the unit halfway with water and &amp;#34;clean it out&amp;#34; to expunge the baking soda that I&#x27;ve added.  But in my mouth, I stick with 8.  It&#x27;s strong enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care about the on/off switch on the handle.  I put the thing in my mouth and then turn the unit on.  I also don&#x27;t care about the 30 second markers.  I use the entire reservoir going tooth to tooth first in the front and then in the back.  I like that 30-second thing on the Sonicare so I&#x27;m sure to give each quadrant 30 seconds of brushing but don&#x27;t see the benefit of that in the water pik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hoping to get at least 3 years of service from this unit.  I will check in in a year to report back!</li>
    <li> excellent product, I fulfilled my expectations on time, packaging, quality and price. Excellent seller, highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;best regards&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guillermo Rey</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like giving my teeth a Jacuzi ride - love this so much.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. My dental hygienist recommended it and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> It is absolutely better than previous..  packaging and delivery also. Only one thing to be desired is the plug is not compatible in Korea</li>
    <li> I like this product:&lt;br /&gt;-easy to use&lt;br /&gt;- easy to set up&lt;br /&gt;- very nice pressure&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons: 4* because it is too loud and it shakes a bit when switched on</li>
    <li> The slider switch on the handle to turn off the spray is very hard to slide. As a result, I have to reach over with my other hand to find the toggle switch on the machine to turn the whole thing off.  All this whilst leaning over the sink while spray is pulsing in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have been making these things for over 40 years. There is no excuse for this inconvenient design.</li>
    <li> It does a good job cleaning my teeth. It&#x27;s easy to use and to maintain. I wish it had holders for the other tips.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected and hoped for.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Resevior is a too small.</li>
    <li> very good! I like it!</li>
    <li> Makes my teeth feel amazing. I just got it but it&#x27;s already making my mouth sing lol.</li>
    <li> only the on/off switch i have some difficulty operating while using the pik, it could be higher up the handle and easier to move. the tubing would not coil back properly if you twist the handle and not return it to the original position. overall very good.</li>
    <li> Great little waterpik. I miss my old one but they no longer make the tips for it. The water reservoir for this one seems a little small so I use two full containers per use. To me, the notice, that hiccup in the water flow is ridiculous.... when the water runs out is runs out! You can&#x27;t skip a tooth just to end on time!</li>
    <li> I used WP-100 model before, and this new WP-660 is more fancy.&lt;br /&gt;Obvious On/Off button is good, color is good, clean and thin top lid is good.&lt;br /&gt;Good job, waterpik.</li>
    <li> This is very beneficial.  It met all of my expectations, except one.  The attachments are for one person.  How do I acquire additional attachments for the family to utilize the Water Flosser, also.  It is also a bit loud but does the job.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended a water flosser for my had to floss areas [crowns]. After some research picked this one.Works great although took a little time to get used to using it.</li>
    <li> I love my Waterpik!  My dental hygienist suggested it because my back teeth are a bit crooked and food tends to get caught.  And in fact, my Waterpik works like a dream!</li>
    <li> A fine product that more than does a good job.  I&#x27;d buy it again in an instant.</li>
    <li> It leaves my teeth feeling very clean. I must go by feel to use it properly, and after almost a month, I still &#x27;misuse&#x27; it on some teeth and have to go back. I can&#x27;t finish in the one minute marked time but finish after most of the water is used.</li>
    <li> Excellent!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the following for my cousin. She is also loving it. However it cost a little more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H28S5GE?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;camp&#x3D;213733&amp;creative&#x3D;393185&amp;creativeASIN&#x3D;B00H28S5GE&amp;linkCode&#x3D;shr&amp;tag&#x3D;swiclu-20&amp;linkId&#x3D;DAXXNIKV47HKW23E&amp;sc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!</li>
    <li> The best WaterPik I&#x27;ve ever owned</li>
    <li> This is the most phenomenal product.  I continue to be amazed at what is left in my mouth, even after flossing and brushing.&lt;br /&gt;I use the waterpik several times a day because I love how clean it makes me feel.</li>
    <li> Strong as hell. I think I gums will bleed if you use anything over 2 for the settings.</li>
    <li> Stopped working after 2 months</li>
    <li> Excellent purchase!!! Easy to use and clean. My children love it!!! Help a lot if someone has dental problems or orthodontist treatments</li>
    <li> Was suggested by the dentist. I tried it and love it ... find myself using it after almost every meal.</li>
    <li> Works awesome. Love it</li>
    <li> A bit noisy on full tilt... I just keep it cranked up to max pressure, but it gets everything out!  Once in while I splash in a 1/2 oz of Listerine in the reservoir and get a nice mouthwash rinse too.  My gums are happy!</li>
    <li> Excellent. I been using an old waterpik with very good results. But I had to replace it with this one after many years of use and could not find parts for it. This new and advanced version has met all my expectations.</li>
    <li> beautiful design, very strong, I have to tuned it down a bits if it is not so expenses I will give it a 5 start</li>
    <li> SO MUCH BETTER THAN YOU LAST MODEL. THANK YOU FOR CHANGING IT. THE OLD ONES WOULD NOT WORK FOR VERY LONG BEFORE I HAD TO GET ANOTHER.  THIS ONE LOOKS LIKE IT WILL HOLD UP BETTER.  IF YOUHAVE TO CHOOSE FOR THIS AND THE OLD ONE I WOULD REMIND THIS ONE.</li>
    <li> very nice and does a good job... be careful at using the high speed to begin with</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing!!  My girlfriend, a dental hygienist, recommended I buy this when she realized that I am absolutely terrible at flossing.  I hate it, I always lose my floss, I forget to do it, etc, etc.  Since I&#x27;ve gotten my Waterpik, I&#x27;ve started using it every day and my gums and teeth are showing marked improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it feels great!  There are different strength settings, so you can adjust the flow of water to whatever is most comfortable for you.</li>
    <li> Love being able to turn the water on and off while using the machine - much easier than the &amp;#34;button&amp;#34; they used to have on the older model that always seemed to get stuck.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended the Waterpik Water Flosser to get at hard to get places, like pockets. The flosser flosses, massages the gums, and has been very effective at cleaning pockets which are hard to get with a brush. I suspect that my pockets will be reduced by the time I see the dentist again. One of the big pluses is that your teeth and the gums feel the way the do after a cleaning and you can have this every day!</li>
    <li> Works really well to help clean my gums and braces.</li>
    <li> I like the massage feature. Missing a place to store the extra picks (brushes)</li>
    <li> excellent product really does the job</li>
    <li> I really like this Waterpik and I use it after as many meals as possible--it really does a great job of releasing debris between teeth.  Originally I started out on setting &amp;#34;2&amp;#34; and gradually increased it to &amp;#34;7&amp;#34; over the course of two weeks.  The water reservoir is handy and lasts for several rinsing sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, be aware that this device *cannot* fully replace manual flossing.  I find that I still need to floss 2-3 times per week to get at some of the buildup between teeth, even with regular brushing.</li>
    <li> I bought this and then realized it was made with BPA. I&#x27;m pregnant so there is no way in hell I&#x27;m using it. Sending it back. 3 stars bc I didn&#x27;t want to leave a bad review when I hadn&#x27;t actually used it. VERY disappointed!</li>
    <li> I rate this one as 3 stars for two reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only accepts 110V as input. And an unpleasant plug.</li>
    <li> Was recommended by my dentist. Works great. I use it for flossing.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s good. it is bit of work to setting it to use though.</li>
    <li> Great....Wonderful... results</li>
    <li> Awesome!! I could not live without this!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely great.  When I went back to my dentist who recommended a waterpik, they were very happy.</li>
    <li> exceeded my expectations!!!!!!  wish I had purchased one&lt;br /&gt;years ago...my teeth feel just like when I come home from the&lt;br /&gt;dentist...slippery clean.....if you are on the fence get off&lt;br /&gt;and purchase one!!! ....just be a careful the first couple of&lt;br /&gt;time you use it....you might just give your bathroom walls&lt;br /&gt;and mirror a good water spray!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been probably ten years or more since I&#x27;ve owned a water flosser; my last one was for when I had braces as a kid.  I remember them being a true pain in the rear to operate, keep clean (along with my counters, mirrors, and sink).  I admit I wasn&#x27;t sure how I would enjoy another one from my less than fond memories of the last.  I purchased this as I&#x27;ve had some gum issues and issues with food getting stuck in my back tooth and floss just wasn&#x27;t cutting it (plus I tend to be lazy with flossing).  I must say I really love this product though.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the strange obsession I have with seeing just how much crap is still left in my teeth after I brushed and then flossed or if it&#x27;s just the convenience of this design and now being in the habit of using it, but I can&#x27;t imagine how I went so long without one.  My teeth and gums are more clean than they been in years and after three weeks of use, it&#x27;s a night and day difference on the improvement of my gum health.  I&#x27;m really still amazed about how well my gum health has improved.  It comes with several different attachments (brush, flossers, one for braces or dental work) and I&#x27;ve only used the flosser.  The water tank is large enough for me to do my entire mouth twice and I&#x27;ve never had to fill the tank twice.  I&#x27;ve only made it to level six on the dial; it goes to ten but my goal is to remove particles not my gum line and six gets the job done for me.  I have stopped flossing entirely and use this every night and my dentist said this actually works better than floss.  Overall I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> No more crumbs in teeth.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a month. It does a good job flossing.</li>
    <li> A lot of noise, the pump pressure jump during washing (to see if defective product ???), correct product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a couple of weeks now.  It appears to get stuff out of the teeth that regular flossing failed to get.  Your mouth feels really good when you are finished.  Wish I had purchased one of these a long time ago.</li>
    <li> my dentist says it works</li>
    <li> Looking at the reviews, there seems to be a consistent effort by what I take are some owners of the venerable Waterpik WP-100 Ultra to trash this new model and portrait it as inferior to the WP-100. I don&#x27;t think this is the case, the WP-660 is an improvement over the WP-100 in many ways and I&#x27;ll tell you why later. The funny thing is that when I bought my WP-100 about six years ago, there were some reviews from what I take were owners of the revered WP-60 Classic trashing the WP-100. I take some people prefer the old to the new and that&#x27;s OK. But I think some reviewers are being unfair to the Aquarius&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I owned a WP-100 that lasted for little over six years, used almost every day by two people, those are a lot of days so the WP-100 is an outstanding product. I did have to replace the water reservoir once due to the cheap rubber valve mechanism -improved on the Aquarius as you will see- that failed after three years of use and started leaking. Also, the hook for the handle broke -also improved on the Aquarius- and it was very difficult if not impossible to hang the handle onto the Waterpik body, I had to makeshift a Velcro handle that looked terrible. Googleing around I was surprised to find that this is a common issue with the WP-100, some owners have replaced the entire unit just because of a broken handle as there is no spare part available from Waterpik. Boomer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But other than those two issues, my Ultra worked flawlessly, I never had to replace the hose or the handle as some owners had to, the on-off switch never failed and it worked the same way it was when new until an accident damaged the power-cord and it stopped working. Given its state with the handle hook and its age, I thought about self-repairing it but then I decided it was time for a new unit. At first and reading all those pro-WP-100 anti-WP-660 reviews I was tempted to get another WP-100, but the price of the Aquarius was about the same as the Ultra so I decided to give it a try&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I did. The first thing you notice with the Aquarius is its modern look and high quality materials, all white and clear, and gorgeous, a significant design improvement over the WP-100. It is also lighter, which some can argue is a good thing -like me- and some can argue it is a bad thing because it \\&quot;feels\\&quot; cheap, which is also a valid point. The important thing is that its weight doesn&#x27;t compromise its operation in any way, it won&#x27;t tip-off when used nor will slide or be unstable, it is just lighter. It might be due to the use of cheaper materials on the pump as some have argued here, or just lighter materials, an overall technological improvement rather than cheapening the unit off. I guess time will tell which one is more durable, or we will have to open both units and compare its guts to get a final answer. So, why is the Aquarius better than the WP-100, other than it looks?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The WP-660 is less noisy and runs smother than the WP-100, you notice this right away. This with no compromise to the water pressure, the pressure is steady, as or more powerful than the WP-100 but it runs better, it sounds less stressed. Same or better results with less noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The hook for the handle was replaced by a sturdier piece and a different design to hold the handle, which reduces the pressure on the piece. With the WP-100, it was very easy to push the handle all the way down the hook, either by accident or just because of its design, stressing the hook and eventually breaking it; there was nothing to stop the handle to slide all the way down. As said, mine broke. That was a poor design, fixed on the Aquarius; now you just put the handle on the holder, it cannot be pushed all the way down. Some have argued that makes it difficult to handle the hose, but I didn&#x27;t find any issues, the hose juts hang there by simple gravity, it doesn&#x27;t tangle or interfere with the unit in any way&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The reservoir valve was replaced by a metal spring mechanism. This was a another design flaw of the WP-100, its reservoir valve consist of a rubber piece, very cheap in my opinion, which eventually gives up and start leaking after a few years. As said before, the only way to fix it is by buying an entire new reservoir as the little rubber piece is not available alone, which means not only paying way more but also a waste of resources. In contrast, the WP-660 has a stainless steel spring with a plastic cap, that appears way more durable and also a much better and higher quality solution. Only time will tell but it seems it will last longer than the one in the WP-100&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The knob to graduate the pressure is easier to operate. The WP-100 has a hole to put both fingers in, on the Aquarius is a protruding knob, very easy to reach and to manipulate, way better I think, easier to find when in use if needed. And also more ergonomic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The Aquarius handle has an on-off switch that actually works. The WP-100 has that dreadful push button on the handle that you need to press constantly to stop the flow of water, doesn&#x27;t stop it completely and also causes the Waterpik to make a noise like the pump is being damaged while the pressure is reverted. Not good at all, it was a poor solution at best, a useless feature at worst, it just didn&#x27;t work. On the WP-660, there is an actual on-off button; in fact the correct way to operate this new Waterpik is to turn it on the base first, then turn it on via the handle when you already have the tip inside your mouth ready to go, the water doesn&#x27;t come out unless you turn the handle on. This is much better than having to reach the switch on the base unit with the tip in your mouth or having to hold into the appalling pressure cutting button on the handle and then release it. All this while water was still coming out of the tip as the button didn&#x27;t cut the water flow completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The pace timer.  This feature is non-existent on the Ultra, and I realized it is very helpful. I use the Waterpik first on the upper section of the mouth, outside-inside and then move to the lower section, in-out and I&#x27;m done. At a pressure level of 8, the water in the reservoir, at full capacity, should last little less than 90 seconds.  The Aquarius will give you a very short flow pause at 30 seconds of use and another at 60 seconds, this is good to pace your cleaning as it should take about 30 seconds to clean each part of the mouth, up and down, and then you have an extra 20 seconds to touch-up. This avoids you having to be periodically peaking over to the reservoir to see how much water is left and instead allow you to concentrate on the cleaning and doing the job properly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The reservoir cover is now part of the unit. If you are like my mother in law that misplaces everything - sorry mom, I still love you-, chances are you have misplaced the reservoir cover of the WP-100 (as my mother in law did). This cover also contains the tips so it can be kind of an inconvenience to lose it. On the WP-660, the cover is attached with a hinge mechanism to the body of the Waterpik, no way to lose it. The tips are now stored on the unit itself, behind the reservoir&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest is about the same as the WP-100, it comes with a bunch of tips from which you will probably only use the classic jet, and a 3 years warranty. It also includes a gum massaging mode which is pointless as you can achieve the same results by regulating the pressure knob. One disadvantage to the WP-100 is that you can only store two tips on the unit and not four, but again if you are like me that use only one, this is not an issue. But it might be for some users, if you have braces for example or like to regularly use the one designed for root canal maintenance (the Pik Pocket). One thing that was bad on the WP-100 and remain as bad on the WP-660 is cable management, there is no place to wrap the cable or at least a Velcro band included to deal with the cable, this lack of cablemanagement is in part responsible for the damage to my WP-100 power cord, the cord is just hanging there. A needed improvement for the next design, please take note Waterpik&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I see no disadvantages when compared with the WP-100 and instead see many advantages. Until the unit has more years in the market, speculating about its durability without real facts is pointless at this time, so far the Aquarius works the same or better than the Ultra so it&#x27;s higher price is justifiable. And you can even get a good deal and get it at the same price or a little cheaper than the Ultra, which is a real bargainul.

    <li> I have not use it yet,but i feel it ok.</li>
    <li> The Water Pik does a fantastic job of cleaning/flossing your teeth.</li>
    <li> Could not ask for anything to work any better</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great, leaves your mouth feeling clean.</li>
    <li> Excellent product to keep gums healthy.</li>
    <li> His dentist recommended this. I was hesitant because the older Waterpiks were not that easy and they were sloppy to use. But my husband loves using this one. Not messy at all. Does the job nicely.........We use a toothbrush sanitizer to sanitize the flosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware if you have a joint replacement or heart condition, especially if you&#x27;re required to take antibiotics before any dental procedure, including a cleaning. The loosened bacteria can cause a heart attack or an infection in the prosthesis. Waterpik makes this clear in the brochure that comes with the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation is to call your cardiologist and/or orthopedic doctor before purchasing.</li>
    <li> Waterpik Aquarius Water Flosser (WP-660)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good product, I Bought it for a Friend, He had plaque issues. He is very impressed with its efficiency in removing plaques.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He Said: to me it does up to 70% of what it claims, Happy with the result, Much better than the alternatives on the Market. I will probably buy one for myself.</li>
    <li> It seems to work okay, my teeth feel cleaner.  However, it&#x27;s really messy! The on/off button on the wand is really stiff, so I have to turn it off and on on the machine, which is a little awkward.  Water squirts all over the place quite easily or runs down my arm to the floor.  I usually use it by bending over the sink as much as possible and closing my mouth.  One then needs to spit out the water or drown!  I&#x27;ve never used a waterpik before, so I don&#x27;t know if this one is unusually messy or if they all are.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough good about this.  Its the best waterpik to date.  I received a rechargeable version made by a different company that just was not powerful enough.  This leaves your gums feeling dentist clean.  I use it religiously twice a day.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Excellent flosser.  Little messy, have to develop your own technique.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with my water pik.  Excellent buy.  A Mtz.</li>
    <li> Missing Tongue Cleaner. It is a fraud !!!</li>
    <li> The product functions but its pretty noisy. It has a dial thay goes from 0 to 10 but it sounds like its going to explode if you turn it past 6. The massage function is useless. With flossing mode, I expected a more constant stream. It comes out in spurts</li>
    <li> Lasted just over 1 yr and then the pik continually came out while trying to use.  I finally got it to stay on only to have it on permanently.  The ejector stopped working completely.  I was ready to throw it out until I saw it had a 3 yrwarranty, I&#x27;m calling the customer service dept tomorrow!</li>
    <li> This replaced another Waterpik we had for years.  I like this one better.  It has good spraying power at different levels.  I also prefer the clear container for the water as I can see if water minerals are collecting so I can thoroughly clean it.  It is small and compact.  Love Waterpik ... and my dentist is glad that I do!</li>
    <li> Small size ,but sufficient for teeth cleaning. Perfect as my imagine.</li>
    <li> My gums are receding, so I need to take a really good care of my oral hygiene. I loved this water flosser. It&#x27;s strong enough to knock out food of my teeth, which is pretty amazing, and disgusting. I recommend adding Listerine to the water. It kills more the bacteria. Great product!</li>
    <li> I hated flossing my teeth with floss and didn&#x27;t do it very much. The Water Pic makes it very easy and I do it every day. My gums are now very healthy. The Water Pic is also great for getting popcorn out from under your gums.</li>
    <li> this makes flossing and cleaning around braces so much easier (or at least he says it does)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it, using a different floss head, at it gets your mouth a lot cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus, it makes for awesome fights in the bathroom when the kids are fighting over the bathroom.  It sprays all the way down the hall when on max setting!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only downside, when used by a teenager, you might be cleaning the mirror every day!  But, that is true with a teenage girl without this contraption!</li>
    <li> I love this water flosser. It is small and compact to fit nicely in my small bathroom. I call it my teeth and gum tool. When I first purchased it, I did so because I have implants and bridges, and I hated the way the threader worked, and really could not make it work. Also, when I got it, I first brushed my teeth, and then I used my little brush pics. After that, I used the pic for flossing implants and bridges, and was amazed how much gunk came out from between my teeth. Honestly, it looked like tiny bugs were being released from between my teeth and that was after the usual brush and floss.  I wish I had started using this product years ago, and I might still have my real teeth in the back instead of implants. I even love cleaning my teeth without having to put my hands in my mouth trying to grab that floss thread.</li>
    <li> This just squeaked by with a four.  The on off switch on the hand held handle is sticky and obsolete.  Just fill up the tank, and put the pic, or whatever in your mouth, and turn it on from unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not a powerful jet, but feels good and does the job.  Gentle on the gums.</li>
    <li> The pulsing action of the jet is a less than satisfactory feeling for me. I liked the steady stream of my old water flosser, but unfortunately that stream turned into more of a trickle (much like those of us with problems in certain regions down-under) so I got this little beauty to replace the old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the convenience of the on/off switch on the actual flosser. The pulsing action of the jet makes the high setting too hard on my gums, so I have to turn it down to an 8, but then it seems less effective at getting stuff out from between the ole chompers (Yes. Teeth.)  But with a little bit of luck, time, and regular dental floss we are able to get most of the food bits. I have an implant and numerous crowns, so having a water-pik is essential to my comfort and gum health.</li>
    <li> Better than expected. I wish I had bought one many years ago.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Just what my dentist recommended</li>
    <li> Good quality low-cost products.</li>
    <li> Very useful. But it is a bit loud</li>
    <li> Very nice just what I wanted THANK YOU</li>
    <li> The glosser is best only if it works. I got one in Dec last year and it lasted hardly for a month. Amazon has been great in replacing the unit in a day. I got the new one in Feb&#x27;15 but now that one stopped working too in 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended that I get a Waterpik.  After several weeks, I like the way it makes my mouth feel and I like the way it cleans. Time will tell what kind of improvement it makes in my gums. My only wish is that they would have made the reservoir a little bigger. It often requires at least a partial refill.</li>
    <li> Is very good, is I have ever used the best goods, thank amazon!</li>
    <li> Excellent product at a good price. The downside may come when replacement parts are required. It may also be messy, so it requires a sink and uses a lot of water. But for good dental hygiene - especially if your teeth trap food - it&#x27;s the best tool available for personal use.</li>
    <li> This has to be the most wonderful invention ever devised. There is a brief learning curve as to its proper use but it gets all of the food particles out of  my teeth &amp; gum line &amp; leaves me with a fresh feeling. I use it in combination with brushing, occasional string flossing (for the tough stuff) &amp; a hydrogen peroxide based mouthwash. I do wish the water controller on the handle were a bit easier to slide, but if that&#x27;s the only complaint, I still give it 5 stars. I brush &amp; use this twice a day, just because it feels so good on my gums.</li>
    <li> works well. Serves it&#x27;s purpose. Good price.</li>
    <li> The water pic died after the first time I used it....my son said he had the same problem with his.  He is returning his but I&#x27;ve decided to purchase another one at the drg store since I could not be without one.</li>
    <li> Love it .So compact  easy to use.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace a 2 year old WP-100. The WP-100 felt underpowered from date of purchase and over time seemed to lose pressure. Comments on the replacement Aquarius Professional Water Flosser follow:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;– Hinged lid is great and makes filling the reservoir easy and not fussy like the 2 piece WP-100 design. This is actually a big deal, the old lid was a nuisance and sometimes fell into the reservoir&lt;br /&gt;– On / Off switch on flosser handle works better than the button not he WP-100&lt;br /&gt;– Pressure is good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;– I&#x27;m already at max pressure and this is Waterpik&#x27;s most powerful flosser. More power would be nice.</li>
    <li> easy on the teeth and gums.  my dentist recommended this since I have large spaces between my teeth and conventional flossing doesn&#x27;t do as good a job with clearning.  easy to use if only a little messy.</li>
    <li> In the past few years I&#x27;ve bought too many electric products that I had to send back because they were defective, but not this one.  It does a good job at what it should do and my husband and I love that it has good pressure.  He bought one in a store and it was so weak it was unbelievable.</li>
    <li> Awesome item that is fun to use. Loved it so much, I purchased an additional Waterpik for my wife. I highly recommend this unit to all individuals.</li>
    <li> The video review here is excellent. I agree with its points.  I had a WP-100 model that developed a leak after a few short months this year. The company mailed me a new part to quickly repair it. Meanwhile I ordered this newer model, lighter, and a lower price. I also see they completely re-designed the part that went bad on my WP-100, the black rubber &amp;#34;valve&amp;#34; at the bottom of the water reservoir. So far very satisfied with this new model.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment and easy to use!</li>
    <li> Great for braces...wow, what a difference. Kids love it, 30 to 60 seconds and all the food particles are gone. Love it, love it, love it!</li>
    <li> replaced my old one and works great</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this, bought from Amazon, and I like that it has a small footprint compared to the Waterpiks of old. It is more than powerful enough and the water tank is just right for a single use. I like that I can control whether the water comes through on the handle of the flosser. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a water flosser that is easy to use and looks good on the countertop.</li>
    <li> Let me not waste your time and cut right to the chase: if you&#x27;re thinking about buying your first Waterpik flosser--or wondering if it&#x27;s time to upgrade your Ultra model--there&#x27;s only one reason to consider the pricey WP-660 Aquarius: it looks nicer and more modern than the now dated design of the Ultra. So if appearance isn&#x27;t important to you, stop reading right here and just go buy the cheaper Ultra, which (as I&#x27;ll get to in a moment) is better in just about every other way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it so happens, an attractive, modern design IS important to me, especially in an appliance that I&#x27;m going to look at all the time in my bathroom. But even in this regard I&#x27;d say the Aquarius is good but not great. It is definitely NOT an improvement in design that will have you looking past its ergonomic flaws vs. the Ultra.</li>
    <li> works well,kids use it for orthodontics.</li>
    <li> My second one and it is much improved. I strongly recommend it. My one concern is that while in use the motor momentarily goes off and then back on. Does this once or twice while in use.this does not interfere with its use.</li>
    <li> Great product. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
    <li> Makes the flossing process less involved.</li>
    <li> Waterpik works great!</li>
    <li> this item is of good quality and works very well.  With daily use I find I don&#x27;t need to use regular floss.  Would recommend this model.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good! I like it . I brush my teeth after every meal ,then use this machine,I feel so good!</li>
    <li> I like it but don&#x27;t know why yet. I wanted to pick one of these up because I was always curious as to how it worked, and if I could finally get rid of the awful sensation of flossing. The first thing to note is that this does blast a high powered concentration of water at your gum lines, so if you have a mirror in front of you like I do expect to do some cleaning. The instructions were a bit vague so I&#x27;ll describe the process of water flossing here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First you fill the reservoir with luke warm water, adjust the water pressure dial for intensity, and somehow try and get the thing in your mouth without spraying water everywhere. The actual usage is to align it between your teeth pointed toward the gumline. This will blow out any food stuck between your teeth and loosen up pockets of tarter. I usually do a once over on the outside of the teeth and then once on the inside. Time-wise this will add a few minutes to your daily dental routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The control and mechanism of use are easy enough to figure out, and the supplied variety of tips gives a good overall value. The unit itself is slightly bulky but not obtrusive, and it seems to fit the ambiance of my Sonicare section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this if your not the greatest flosser in the world, or just don&#x27;t like the feeling of flossing, and if your willing to do a bit of cleanup afterward.</li>
    <li> Works great. First time user of water floss, surprised how easy and better than thread way.</li>
    <li> Used every day and she loves the results</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to do.  My teeth feel clean and refreshed after using it</li>
    <li> I spend a considerable amount of time researching products before purchasing them, and a new Waterpik was no exception. I read through the pros and cons for this unit, and decided that I could purchase this confidently. The package was hassle free, and set up was a breeze. The unit is very intuitive to use, the manual is basically not needed. I love how little counter space the unit takes up, and the modern design isn&#x27;t an eyesore on the bathroom counter. The top closes over the water reservoir, so no dust collects in their. All the pieces snap together nicely, and everything feels sturdy and durable. The setting for water pressure is responsive, and I LOVE how the water flow pulses, reminding you to move on to the next area in your mouth. I like how the cord on the unit coils up back into a built in pocket on the unit. Really, this is a very good device and one I could recomend without reservation. If there&#x27;s one complaint I do have, it would be that the device doesn&#x27;t have the space to hold all the different little nozels that it comes with and can only hold two. They are tucked under the lid, thereby helping to avoid dust contamination. I guess you sacrafice the storage space for the svelt design of the unit. It&#x27;s not a huge deal, I have drawers and cupboards in my bathroom and just have the extra tips in a container in one of the drawers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros- great compact modern design&lt;br /&gt;  durable feel, not cheap feeling&lt;br /&gt;  lid closes keeping water reservoir and tips free from dust/contamination&lt;br /&gt;  intuitive user experience&lt;br /&gt;  responsive settings&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons- lack of space to hold extra tips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a good oral irrigator, I would highly recomend considering the Waterpik Aquarius</li>
    <li> Returned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaks like crazy because it&#x27;s not a good hose. Loud. Takes up a lot of space. shape of it also kind of encourages spills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are better more convenient water flossers from ToiletTree.</li>
    <li> As I get older gum issues become more of a problem.  I am amazed at how much food particles are not gotten out of my gums by flossing and brushing.  The Waterpik removes more of the debri in my mouth.  I believe in the long run it will help me to maintain good dental health.  If anything can help with good dental care, the Waterpik will.</li>
    <li> Nice design.  Works well.</li>
    <li> i love this!!! my mouth feels so fresh and clean after!! and it helps massage my gums after i floss. i am addicted! i&#x27;m going to buy one for my mom next</li>
    <li> works well. Sometimes it shuts off and will not go back on</li>
    <li> easy to use, nice and clean.</li>
    <li> Great product with a few issues.  It is difficult to operate the on/off feature on the handle when it&#x27;s wet but it&#x27;s too easy to push the eject button to release the flosser tip.  I&#x27;ve released the tip too many times while in use.  Will have to hold the handle towards the bottom to avoid this from continuing to happen.  Can some times be difficult to align the reservoir to the flosser when full of water.</li>
    <li> Works well. Adjustable pressure allows for kids-adults customize how fast the water flows.  Gets small bits out much better than floss.</li>
    <li> Works beautifully and is less noisy than the previous version. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> amazing product, everybody should have one</li>
    <li> Really good buy.  This is my 3rd waterpick and I do like it the best.  Only problem is that the release button for the tip is on the handle and it can be pushed accidentally while in use - sprays water everywhere, I have learned to avoid this problem after a few soakings (I&#x27;m left-handed that could be the problem).</li>
    <li> I like it because it&#x27;s smaller &amp; quieter than my old Waterpik monster. The pocket tip doesn&#x27;t seem to be any use, but the flosser part is fine. I hope it lasts four years, as my old one did.</li>
    <li> Better and easier than flossing.</li>
    <li> It is very useful. I got a implant and it is necessary to me.</li>
    <li> great flosser i use it daily</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING A WATER PIX FOR OH SO MANY YEARS NOW AND THIS IS THERE BEST MODEL YET AND AT A FABULOUS JPRICE THROUGH AMAZON.</li>
    <li> It is not user friendly.</li>
    <li> works well but motor is quite noisy.</li>
    <li> Very nice, does a great job and doesn&#x27;t take up too much room.  My dentist recommended it and he is an artist in a dentist&#x27;s body so my husband has beautiful teeth to take care of.</li>
    <li> I think this works very well, my only complaint is it is small, which is great for taking it on trips, but for everyday use I wish I had got a bigger one, for me I have to re-fill the water one more time to get a complete clean.</li>
    <li> Old waterpik flosser started leaking so looked around for a replacement. First I bought the cordless version but wasn&#x27;t enamored with it. The corded flosser isn&#x27;t very big (speaking of counter space) and all the parts work together well. I can get to all the nooks and crannies without any difficulty.  Seal between the water container and the main unit is excellent. I would have changed the position of the tip ejector as it is too easy to eject the tip while looking for the on/off button. Small matter, however and isn&#x27;t a deal killer.&lt;br /&gt;If you are trying to decide between this and the portable unit get this one unless you really can&#x27;t be by an outlet.</li>
    <li> Works well. Took me some time to learn the right technique but with a little persistence and time you&#x27;ll get there. I think it&#x27;s a definite must have! Sometimes I even clean hardly accessible parts of my sink with it. Sometime it fails to clean the plaque and I still have to brush. But it&#x27;s interesting how much stuff it cleans out from in between the teeth. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is a great new appliance for caring for your teeth &amp; gums. Easy to use &amp; very effective for keeping your teeth &amp; gums clean between professional teeth cleanings.</li>
    <li> several different heads to use and works great, gets the job done. Also its priced quite well. no complaints here!</li>
    <li> The best please buy it</li>
    <li> This waterpik is amazing and works very well. I have one complaint though, I mean I assume there is motor in it to pump out the stream of pressurized water, but this thing make a loud vibrating noise when it is on, and it does not go away. It is not a terrible thing, but it might be annoying to people who are close by just as a FYI. Otherwise I love it, removes anything between your teeth extremely well and leaves your mouth refreshed. I myself pour some mouthwash into the container with water just so when I am flossing with it, the mouthwash can help too.</li>
    <li> My most concern was the enough pressure to blast anything in the rear teeth that has no gaps in between. Once I used it it was excellent &amp; I&#x27;m very happy with that great advancement in my healthy clean life. I use it always after every meal with one scope of mouth wash &amp; it took me about 10 times to become an expert as it&#x27;s very easy to use. I love it.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical about using the Waterpik, but I&#x27;m now a believer.  I&#x27;ve always had a detailed dental-hygiene routine but still had trouble with those teeth in the back.  The Waterpik, set on medium, gets all the stuff my floss and brush miss, and the results can be seen and felt.  My teeth feel smooth, and my mouth feels fresher for longer after.  I was worried that this would be too rough on my gums, but neither I nor my dentist are seeing any problems so far.  I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Have not had it very long ,but seems to do the job.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE the waterpik flosser and worth the money!!!! I bought this product blindly (didn&#x27;t know anything about it besides it was great for braces). Like a lot of other people I HATE flossing especially with braces (would literally take me 20 minutes per row) however, with this flosser I was able to save time and have been getting great comments from my orthodontist and her assistants about how well my flossing has improved. Additionally, the different settings on the dial allows me to adjust the pressure of the water, making it easier on my gums after a tightening. The different tips that were included is a plus but I only use the general one. If I did have to choose a negative, it&#x27;s that I can&#x27;t move around with it and I have to floss using the string while at work or school BUT they do have a cordless flosser that should be equally efficient as this one.</li>
    <li> Grand son had to get braces at 8 years of age.  It made all the difference  in helping keep his teeth clean and much earlier to u;se then a tooth brush.</li>
    <li> The off-on switch on the handle is very helpful and I like the \\&quot;pocket flusher\\&quot; (my term), just follow directions, start gently!  Shipping was fast and secure - I received a new unit.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied I would recommend</li>
    <li> This is just what I was hoping it would be.  Flossing was irritating my gums and deepening pockets between my teeth.  The Waterpik is great.  It removes food debris and massages my gums..  I look forward to using it.  I recommend using it at the 4 or 5 setting since the one time I tried it at 9, one of my crowns came off.  (The crown must have already become very loose and it was probably a good thing that it came off when using the Waterpik and not during a social situation.)</li>
    <li> Very useful tool, outstanding results&lt;br /&gt;Yes I will recommend It to a friend</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t have time or patience to write a review all  I can say is its a hundred percent very satisfied</li>
    <li> So easy to use and cleans my teeth better than regular floss</li>
    <li> Works great and feels like you&#x27;ve just been at the dentist.  Should have gotten one a long time ago!</li>
    <li> Great little machine. After using it, I feel like I just had my teeth cleaned at the dentist&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> Wished I would have ordered a waterpik years ago. Have had this for some time now and still works great.</li>
    <li> Works well. Clear instructions. Seems like good quality construction.</li>
    <li> I was reasonably disappointed in the product as I thought that it came with a portable unit as well which it apparently did not.  We have found the pik to be adequate for out needs and do use it nearly every day.  Again I am sorry that I  mis-read the advertisement as I would have opted for a different purchase.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Only complaint would be that their older model stores the other attachments in the lid.</li>
    <li> Very good product and offer, i&#x27;ve got a little delay in the delivery because i said that it should be sent on daytime and it arrived at nightime but out of that i recomend this for all people with crowns and orthodentics</li>
    <li> Excellent product works great!</li>
    <li> This water flosser is great. I have never used water flossers before, so I cannot compare it with other flossers. However, I felt the difference right after the first use. I bought extra hard toothbrush, electric brushes, but nothing gave same affect like this Waterpik flosser. It also comes with 7 differnt tips. I read from other costumers reviews that this one is noisy, but I don&#x27;t think so. Almost everything is perfect with this product.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have ever bought a waterpik. I did not like it. I made a mess and the water in the reservoir finished very fast. If anyone is thinking of buying this, I suggest to have patience and learn how to use it. My experience my not be the fault of the device, I believe it is one of the best. I hate to say I have not used it since the first time I took it out of the box. I just bought better floss and brush more. The waterpik is something to conquer.</li>
    <li> Works well, good price</li>
    <li> Great gadget to keep teeth healthy.</li>
    <li> First time I used waterpik since the 70&#x27;s and can&#x27;t believe how much better it has become! Very easy to use and  love all the different attachments. The design is not only speak, but actually helps to ensure proper use (ensuring the water cup is properly set in the base). It&#x27;s more powerful than I remember the first generation. So powerful you can see the difference in your teeth after the first use. It&#x27;s like having a professional dentist cleaning. Packaging was tight and clean. An excellent product.</li>
    <li> Works very well, this is our 2d WaterPik, the old one gave up the ghost after 5+ years, so definitly got our money&#x27;s worth out of it.</li>
    <li> Works very well I have difficulty manipulating the traditional floss to clean my teeth. I use this instead with good results, and my mouth feels so much cleaner and fresher, overall.</li>
    <li> It does what it is suppose to do, and we use it regularly</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using this waterpik for about a month and love it.  It really helps with our oral health, can&#x27;t wait for my next dental appointment</li>
    <li> I use a Waterpik Aquarius Water Flosser (WP-660) every night and sometimes during the day if something gets stuck between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;My previous one lasted many years - only the tubing got hard and broke...</li>
    <li> I bought this item as per my hygienist, and I love it. Every time I use it, it feels like I just left the dentist for a cleaning. This is an amazing item. I don&#x27;t believe you will regret buying it.</li>
    <li> Great addition to our Dental hygene ritual! We love using this water flosser - it really cleans and massages your gums. Wish we would have started using it years ago!</li>
    <li> I bought this product about a year ago and now the motor has stopped working. I bought another form Amazon and it is leaking from somewhere inside the machine, so I am returning it for a replacement. I will give it one more try and hopefully I will get a good one this time.</li>
    <li> Modernized and more functional than earlier models.  Very satisfied</li>
    <li> This worked really well for me to help with some extra dental cleaning. Maybe too many parts. Price was good. Shipping was perfect. It was very easy to use. My dentist is proud of me now.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great, small, clean, easy to use and neat as pin!</li>
    <li> So far so good - seems to really work well.  My teeth and gums feel great, and it is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> We don&#x27;t really use this. Seemed like a good idea at the time, but does it really do anything?</li>
    <li> I wanted an oral irrigator and started looking at the variety available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually I settled for &amp;#34;WaterPik&amp;#34; and well... I liked the way the Aquarius looked (a big plus LOL), especially with the smaller foot print.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now using this unit for the 4th time since received and I have absolutely NO COMPLAINTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is what it is, it does what it claims very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a happy camper.</li>
    <li> It appears to do a very good job, your mouth feels very clean,  Waterpik, Floss , Brush&lt;br /&gt;Works good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a waterpik fan! Keeps my teeth and guns so clean and healthy. Can&#x27;t live without!</li>
    <li> The Aquarius makes significant but seemingly minor improvements over the WP-100.  I bought it to replace a decade-old WP-100 that died on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Connector in tank is made out of plastic.  The connector in the WP-100 was made of rubber, and over time it started to peel and fall apart.&lt;br /&gt;-On-off switch on handle.  The WP-100 had a pause button that was useless because it was constantly getting stuck.  This switch actually works.&lt;br /&gt;-Flip lid means no more accessories falling into the tank, which always happened to me on the WP-100.&lt;br /&gt;-It looks a lot nicer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish this unit would be shorter and fold up like the old-school Waterpiks.  The Aquarius is much lighter than the WP-100, and if they had made it more portable, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.  There are several usage modes, but honestly, I find them kind of useless and I never actually bother with them.</li>
    <li> After about a year the motor busted. The power button light still turns on but it won&#x27;t start. I didn&#x27;t save my warranty (who does?) so I&#x27;m annoyed that this broke so soon.</li>
    <li> I replaced my old water flosser with this one. Wow. It does a great job and it is so quiet compared to my old one.</li>
    <li> I would have given 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t so loud.  Theis waterpik is great.  I am obsessed with it.</li>
    <li> We all use this in our house and have great results!</li>
    <li> I have had two previous Ultra models that have each failed after 1 year (yes, I know....why would you buy another WaterPik then).  WaterPik has great customer service and replaced the last Ultra unit without cost or fuss (the first unit i just replaced on my own) due to a motor problem.  I just got this one and it is similar or slightly better than the Ultra.  Will the pump last 3 years (like the warranty covers)?  Hard to know, but daily use for even 2 years is a good bargain in this day and age.  Very efficient in removing food between teeth after brushing.  I haven&#x27;t used floss in 5 years and my dentist can&#x27;t tell!  Maybe pricey but aren&#x27;t your teeth worth it?  Buy now ($68) since last week I paid $80 (bummer for me).</li>
    <li> Excellent design and functionality in every way.  Water tooth  brushing function is a blast</li>
    <li> Does everything as described.And the price was a better buy @ Amazon than any other place I checked.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like to give it a higher rating, but the hand piece is so difficult to turn on .  It should slide much easier.  I finally got it on with the help of a rubber sure grip to open jars.  Now I keep it on and don&#x27;t make the mistake of not having the flosser tip in my mouth when I turn the main control on.  It does a good job though.</li>
    <li> Arrived exactly as described. Great value</li>
    <li> Definately better than the standard model. Having the pressure regulator at the pump instead of the handle relieves the surging hose issue. The tip releases easily due to the nice release button, and the head turns easier with the notched collar. Worth the extra $10.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for months: increasingly amazed.</li>
    <li> Have been using it about a week. Excellent and makes my mouth feels cleaner than before. However, the on-off switch on the holder is pretty hard to press, if not it would have been given a 5 rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do note to not be too ambitious to raise the pressure setting because it takes time to learn to use it properly and always point the tip at 90 degrees. I&#x27;ve raised it to 8 too quickly and by pointing the tip wrongly, I do experience jolts of pain sometimes.</li>
    <li> I love this thing, I dont know how I went so many years without a water flosser, a bit noisy but its sturdy and powerful</li>
    <li> Love this water pic. Easy to use and clean. Works great! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> So far I love this product, I can let you know in about 5 months if it made a difference on my dental hygiene visits</li>
    <li> nice water flosser, easy to use, and wonderful cleaning performance</li>
    <li> This product is recommended by my denist.  I use it everyday after I flossed but sometimes still can rinse away some leftover food between teeth.  It is amazing.</li>
    <li> Best water Pik for the money.  small compact design.  Only thing I don&#x27;t like is it&#x27;s loud but so are the others.</li>
    <li> I got this and tried it and it pulses when it&#x27;s not on pulse mode (bogs down sorta). Don&#x27;t know if I received a defective one or what. I don&#x27;t like that though. Also, this thing it soooo messy!!!! Nearly impossible to use without spraying water everywhere. The cord stays spiraled up so its very short. The button on the flosser is very hard to slide up and down to turn on and off.  Also it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s even doing any sort of flossing or cleaning. Save your money and stick with regular flossing.</li>
    <li> Amazing I love it... Highly recommend</li>
    <li> It works as well as the last water pick i had but the motor cuts out every once in a while when i&#x27;m using it, for a split second and comes back on</li>
    <li> so far I like this, have been using it about a month each night, I put in a little mouth wash and it seems to work great. I hate flossing so this has been wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The white tube connecting it to the container is not amazing, it&#x27;s coiled up but over the month has loosened up a bit and isn&#x27;t super easy to put back in the spot it goes. The wand part of it also doesn&#x27;t stay in the inadequate holder, but it&#x27;s fine, just not perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes some getting used to to hold your hand and face just right so you can let the water fall in the sink and not all over the counter, and not have water running down your arm. But I don&#x27;t think you could avoid that.</li>
    <li> I wish I had bought one of these years ago. Way better than flossing and one can see the food debris fall into the sink and flow down the drain.</li>
    <li> Walk Away feeling like you left the dentist&#x27;s office</li>
    <li> Functions as expected and just fine.  The only reason that I did not rate it with five stars is that the location where the tips are stored can only be accessed with the water reservoir removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read in other reviews where others have had problems with spraying water all over their bathroom mirrors, their faces, etc.  I do not have that problem nor did my wife.  Quite simply, those with the spraying problems should insert the tip fully into their mouths BEFORE turning the water on the handle.  Secondly, bend over the sink and keep their mouths nearly closed, opened no more than necessary to permit the water to flow into the sink!  Simple, huh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery from Amazon was as promised.  Packaging was as it should be; protected and in a box appropriate for the item being shipped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Montana Bob</li>
    <li> This device is very cool. You can use it after meals to rinse out your mouth and it&#x27;s just about like you brushed! It is kinda loud, but it works well.</li>
    <li> The water flosser was exactly what I expected,and has performed flawlessly.</li>
    <li> As an adult braces wearer I am so pleased with this Waterpik!</li>
    <li> I love the satisfied products</li>
    <li> This Waterpiik really does the job. My teeth feel like they were professionally cleaned every time I use it.</li>
    <li> I love this gadget. I wanna clarify that I AM NOT a water flosser specialist, I don&#x27;t have a degree in water flossers and, before this one, I had never used one before. Now, if after that disclaimer you&#x27;re still interested in my opinion, then here it is. When I purchased it, I was concerned about the water pressure this flosser would have, meaning I was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t be strong enough. Wrong. It has several levels of pressure and 10 is really strong! It feels really good in between your teeth as you&#x27;re using it and you can really feel it going between your teeth. Honestly, I don&#x27;t have any complaints about it. My fiance thinks the water tank is too small, but I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot of space on my bathroom counter top. I would not recommend substituting it to actual flossing, but it&#x27;s still a great complementary habit to include in your daily dental hygiene routine.</li>
    <li> The unit was delivered with the wrong voltage. 110 V instead of 220 V, which is used in all Europe.&lt;br /&gt;So actually 1 star is to much. It was not working.&lt;br /&gt;Staffan Sellgren&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;staffan@sellgren.be</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it!  My mouth feels so clean after using it.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Does the job.</li>
    <li> it works very well and does an amazing job. The only complain I have is the On/Off switch is very hard to push. It is unrealistic to really pause when you are flossing because your probably gonna need both hands to push the bottom down.</li>
    <li> Water all over the place... I hated this thing.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected. This was a big step up from the battery powered model that while not portable does a better job. Very pleased with the results and a much healthier set of gums.</li>
    <li> Omg I love this machine! I actually floss regularly first, and then use this to push the junk out. My teeth and gums feel super clean after. It&#x27;s pretty nice...</li>
    <li> Great product.  Dental hygienist was impressed with results.  Lightning fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item after the hygientist suggested I use one. It does get out food particles that brushing leaves behind. I should be using it more often but it does create a mess. I move everything out of the way and water gets all over the wall and mirror. I&#x27;m not sure why but my mouth fills up with excess water as well. I probably need to use it more often and try to figure it out better.</li>
    <li> Why did I not buy it sooner.... great waterpick</li>
    <li> I recently underwent over 10 thousand dollars of dental procedures so effective oral hygiene is a must for me.  It took a couple tries to master the correct usage but now I have the best flossed teeth in my family. I really enjoy using my water flosser daily, it leaves my mouth fresh and clean especially if I add a little bit of mouth wash to the reservoir.  I don&#x27;t have any complaints about my Waterpik Aquarius Water Flosser, it is a winner in my book.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I have quite a bit of crowns/bridges.  I love how clean this gets in all of it!!!!</li>
    <li> I have owned several Water Pik products over the years.  This model seems to have overcome many of the disappointments and limitations of previous models.  Sadly, there are no serious competitors in this market, so this particular model seems to be the best there is.</li>
    <li> WOW powerful. I think I can clean a roof with this thing.</li>
    <li> It makes your mouth feel as clean as the day you had your professional cleaning at the dentist!  Just keep your lips closed though or it will spray everywhere!</li>
    <li> Quick posted.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect solution.&lt;br /&gt;I am totally satisfied with everything.&lt;br /&gt;Best price.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of workmanship.</li>
    <li> Wish I purchased sooner</li>
    <li> loved it use it often</li>
    <li> I just had dental implants , and this machine is terrific, I use it every day before brushing .  Absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> My dentist has been recommending that I get a water flosser.  I finally did and believe that it is helping keep my teeth cleaner.  I do have issues with getting food stuck between my teeth and have found that the Waterpik Aquarius removes the food and makes my gums feel healthier.  The Aquarius seems to be well made and I have had no problems with it in the month and half that I have been using it.  Like a lot of other reviews, the on/off switch on the handle is difficult to push, but I don&#x27;t find it bothersome.  This is my first water flosser and am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> My wife just got braces put on and this device works great on them.</li>
    <li> Packaged well and arrived without damage and on time. Great unit does everything its advertised to do. Its not real loud or too big and bulky like I thought it might be. We haven&#x27;t had it long enough to tell if it makes a difference with the dental visits yet but my wife says it works well for her bridge. Glad I went with the Aquarius even though it cost a little more.</li>
    <li> First time using a waterpik and find it effective and easy to use.</li>
    <li> The on/off button is very difficult to switch on or off. I have to use both hands.  The product works like the description says. I think it is better than regular flossing. My dentist suggest using both.  I am just concerned the on/off button may break. Of course, I purchased an extended warranty for a few dollars. I would purchase it again and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Good product and fast delivery</li>
    <li> why it doesn&#x60;t work??</li>
    <li> Great for all teeth cleaning</li>
    <li> What I expected on a Water Flosser from Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for a great transaction!</li>
    <li> This is very good for people who have difficulty reaching areas of the mouth with floss and brushing.  I have a small mouth and lots of teeth so it works good for me.</li>
    <li> It works great! I finally got rid of the flossing.</li>
    <li> I do love it.  I now need just three cleanings a year instead of four, and the technician gives praise vice warnings to &amp;#34;floss better.&amp;#34;  And it saves significant time.  Buy it now.  You&#x27;ll love it, too.</li>
    <li> excellent product, works very well.</li>
    <li> Works very well for flossing and gum stimulation</li>
    <li> Little disappointed.  It seems to splash water around from the handle more than my old one.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep and call the manufacturer if t his does not work itself out.</li>
    <li> This is my first waterpik and I cannot say enough. Due to health issues I frequently have bad breath but this has helped a lot. It is messy so be sure to do it over a sink. My teeth look whiter and cleaner as well.</li>
    <li> inevitably, the semi-rigid PVC tubing that goes from the base to the wand will develop cracks and break around the point where the hose goes into the handle. When that breaks, you throw the entire unit into the trash.</li>
    <li> Mouth never has been healthier and cleaner!</li>
    <li> Stay tuned. Trying to post video of stuck problem but can&#x27;t find way on this mobile app.&lt;br /&gt;PROs: actually works since I&#x27;ve seen food particles in my stream after brushing my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;CONs: stuck button after 90 days of use. I&#x27;ve tried vinegar but nothing works. Problem is there&#x27;s no way to disassemble the handle unit to see what the problem is.</li>
    <li> This thing is so awesome. I should have gotten this a LONG time ago!!</li>
    <li> I have always relied on Waterpiks to keep my gums healthy. My previous model broke, which I&#x27;ve had for 5 years. I replaced it with this modeI and I love it. This one is very quiet compared to other models. I was surprised that it was much more efficient at cleaning than my previous one. Its controls and storage for additional tools is nice and neat. I am slightly disappointed in the amount of water the reservoir holds. It is just a little short of holding the pik about 5 seconds on each tooth. Otherwise, the performance is great, with better control of the water flow than previous models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Removes up to 99.9% of Plaque from Treated Areas*&lt;br /&gt;More Effective for Healthy Gums vs. String Floss*&lt;br /&gt;Has Hydro-Pulse Massage Mode for Enhanced Gum Stimulation&lt;br /&gt;7 Tips Included&lt;br /&gt;Tips Rotate 360 Degrees&lt;br /&gt;Has 10 Pressure settings&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;90 Seconds of Water Capacity for some maybe a little bit too short&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Purchased this Waterpik to replace my old one of 10 years.  Works like a charm.  It is a smaller base and doesn&#x27;t take up as much counter top as the old one, so already a plus in that department.  Hope this one lasts as long as the other one.</li>
    <li> Water flossing is messy at best, but this machine is simple to use and does a good job.</li>
    <li> works wonderfully, easy! only wish they would integrate to 2 buttons (pump power and flow trigger) into one button.</li>
    <li> Better because at least I use this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like a pressure washer for your mouth. I love it when I eat popcorn or steak or some other &amp;#34;debris prone&amp;#34; food and use this thing to flush out all that stuff out every corner of my mouth. So refreshing, and my breath is so much better now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like flossing with the string at all, I could never do it regularly, but with this waterpik, I do it basically everyday, so that&#x27;s a huge plus in my book. It&#x27;s fun to do.</li>
    <li> Feels a little flimsy (lid, attachment holder). I hope it holds up well.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Fast shipping. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Fine for what it is and does</li>
    <li> Works as well as I expected.</li>
    <li> This is *such* a great tool. I feel like it brings a whole new level of cleanliness to my mouth (I&#x27;m pretty much addicted to using it 1 or 2 times a day now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using a nice Sonicare electronic toothbrush &amp; flossing, but my dentist recommended I get a water pick to help out just a little more along the edge of my gums. I couple of years ago I had bought a cordless Waterpik Waterflosser ... but it was so weak that I didn&#x27;t feel like it was making a difference, and so cumbersome to use that I just really never wanted to use it (I probably used it 12 times in a couple of years).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on online reviews, I decided to give this Waterpik WP-660 a try. And was I impressed! I only have to fill the tank 1 time to do my entire mouth, I can hold the wand in any position/angle I want, and I can dial-up as much pressure as I would want. As an initial test, I turned the pressure on 6 (out of 10), and ran the water jet around the edge of the metal hole/plug in the sink - it quickly blew out all the grime that brushes &amp; cleanser hadn&#x27;t been able to get out! (if it could do that to sink grime, I knew it could easily blast out any food &amp; plaque that might be around my teeth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now (using the standard tip, and pressure from 4-8), and my teeth (and whole mouth) just &#x27;feel&#x27; cleaner than they&#x27;ve ever been. It&#x27;s so convenient to use, and I feel like it&#x27;s actually doing something, that I am actually eager to use it every day (as opposed to the cordless one), and sometimes use it an extra time after a meal or snack just to get the food remnants out from between my teeth.</li>
    <li> I use the Waterpik professional to do my teeth every night. This Waterpik works great and is made with quality materials.I would highly recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> dentist recommended and I understand why.  Leaves your mouth refreshed</li>
    <li> Fabulous, easy to use, quality product.  Purchased when a broken hand prevented usual flossing and I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it now!  Does a great job of cleaning teeth and gums.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This model is much better than the old oval tank and it&#x27;s cover, which always fell in. Pump sounds quieter too. Hose is better attached and should hold together longer. Over all, Waterpik has put out a better machine. Had two of the old ones, have two of these.</li>
    <li> Does a good job of cleaning between the teeth and under bridges (dental bridges--the homeless need not fear it).  Also effectively massages the gums and makes &#x27;em feel good, though you have to be careful to position it correctly and adjust the power setting or you&#x27;ll feel the pain.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had dental surgery for gum problems and the periodontist office recommended getting a Waterpik that has the tip designed for getting into pockets in the gums. I first bought the standard model you see everywhere at drug stores, but returned it - too big and bulky for my small sink, very noisy, no cover on the water tank, and too much water flow for me to even find the pockets. I then ordered this model and really like it. It doesn&#x27;t take up as much room on the counter, it has a cover over the water, and comes with several different tips. They include the one designed for getting into pockets, one with a toothbrush head, one designed for braces, and one with bristles that is also more effective for pockets and removing plaque. It also has two settings, floss or massage, and much better controls for the water flow you want. I like it so much that I just ordered one for my son. This is more effective than my Sonicare air/water flosser to get into those pockets.</li>
    <li> missing some items that are suppose to be included like the tongue wiper</li>
    <li> Works awesome - so much better than any other WaterPik I have had before.  Hands-down the best WaterPik of all!</li>
    <li> Bought it for my mom, she said it worked very well. The sound is a little aloud but acceptable. Need to transfer to 220V in China, remember!!</li>
    <li> So far, so good. I used to use the Phillips airfloss, but after breaking two of them, I think I&#x27;ll stick with the Waterpik going forward unless I&#x27;m traveling. They both seem to offer plenty of pressure, but the Waterpik holds so much more water that it&#x27;s way quicker and easier. I usually had to go through two refills when using the airfloss, but with this I just fill it up and turn it on until it&#x27;s all gone. I can usually do all my teeth twice. It&#x27;s obviously not as portable and requires some counter space, but overall I just think it&#x27;s better. It comes with a few different nozzles and settings, but I tend to just use the standard nozzle and max pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get rid of your airfloss though, as this really isn&#x27;t travel friendly.</li>
    <li> It works pretty good, makes a lot of noise when turned on.  Have to be careful with the on switch on the wand, as there is one to turn it on and off, also one to release the tip, I hit the wrong one and the tip came loose and I had water everywhere.  You just have to be aware where both switches are.</li>
    <li> Works well, however, hard to tell exactly how well it cleans gums and beneath teeth. Unlike floss where you remove actual food particles, I don&#x27;t see evidence of removal, except that my mouth feels cleaner after use.</li>
    <li> use it everyday. it does the job w/o leaving strings in your mouth</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had it very long but so far, so good.  It was recommended by a dental hygenist and it is definitely helping our dental issues.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Works very well.</li>
    <li> It is as I hoped it would be.</li>
    <li> purchased this to replace our other waterpik we had for a while, we love it</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  I like the massage setting. and the variable pressure dial.  Two minutes with the Flosser goes by very quickly and may need to be refilled during use; the reservoir on my old Waterpick  was much larger.  FYI - my experience confirmed what my periodontist cautioned;  you will still have to floss to remove plaque.</li>
    <li> Best investment I ever made. The bits of food coming out from every angle is worth every penny. Bye bye Flossing! Hello water gun! Great Deal and Super Fast Shipping Thanks to Prime.</li>
    <li> I like it. it&#x27;s my first warterpik&lt;br /&gt;My gingiva is weak by orthodontic device&lt;br /&gt;I feel good to my gingiva by using warterpik</li>
    <li> Easy to learn, better if the brush head could shock too.</li>
    <li> OK we&#x27;ve had this for a couple weeks now and it seems to work great.  I use it 1-2 times per day.  Wish we would have bought one sooner.  I&#x27;ve been looking into the sonic toothbrushes but from what I&#x27;ve been reading they don&#x27;t work any better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great but I stick to only using one tip. The real reason I couldn&#x27;t give it a five star is because of the sheer noise and rumble it starts if you turn it up to the highest level.</li>
    <li> Holy cow, I&#x27;m 43 years old and can&#x27;t believe I haven&#x27;t purchased one of these before. I had two teeth that  would have odor when I flossed the area. My dentist recommended a WaterPik so I purchased it since it was on sale. I brush and use this thing and I have been cured of  any foul odor or bacteria in the gumline. It&#x27;s almost magic and I can&#x27;t recommend it enough. I put a capful of peroxide in the water and have the pressure setting on eight and it works like a charm. Absolutely love&lt;br /&gt;Other people say there&#x27;s no difference between the previous model and this new one but when I purchased they both for the same price so I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> works great.. removes so much &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; after you floss.. good for folks with periodontal issues like have.&lt;br /&gt;very happy with purchase</li>
    <li> I love this item.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for selling</li>
    <li> I bought this water glosser for my wife, thinking it was the same as the one I use but this one is better.&lt;br /&gt;This one has a hinged cover which is a big  emprovement.</li>
    <li> Will pay for itself in short order.</li>
    <li> Excellent ,I love it very much!</li>
    <li> This was for my daughter and she is very happy with it</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Does a great job of leaving my mouth feeling super clean!!!</li>
    <li> I like this water flosser and would recommend it. I don&#x27;t find the hose a hinderance at all even though some other reviewers have noted that. The description is clear and true.</li>
    <li> I recommend this to anyone who has braces because I hate using floss so I only use this waterpik and an electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even after brushing your teeth, you will find this waterpik to remove additional gunk in your mouth. Sometimes, you can even smell the gunk that has been sitting between or under your gumlines (like if you have wisdom tooth partially erupted).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a must buy to avoid future dental costs!</li>
    <li> I have use Waterpiks for years, but it was finally time to get a new one; the last one lasted over 15 years.  I have always felt this is the best way to clean your teeth and massage your gums; particularly good after foods like popcorn, steak, and corn on the cob.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> good quality and good price ! thanks!</li>
    <li> Works well, does the job of knocking out gunk from between your teeth as a precursor to a good brushing.  Have had it for a year, still going strong.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd Waterjet I have purchased over the last 20 years or so.  The one before it had all the bells and whistles which I never used, never.  The first one was the very simplest and lowest priced and the one that sold me on Waterjets.  This new one is just fine except it has a few items (nozzles,spoons and ect) that I pitched while unpacking to save confusion later.</li>
    <li> Great unit! Does excellent job. Wish that water capacity reservoir was bigger</li>
    <li> really has a lot of power, be careful of setting too high</li>
    <li> I purchased this for use on my daughters braces and habit breaking bar.  It works very well at removing stuck particles and relieving some of the ache in her gums.  The only reason that it lost one star is because it is quite messy to use on my daughter.  She gets overwhelmed with the amount of water in her mouth at one time.  We usually use it over the sink so that the water runs out of her mouth directly to the sink.  I personally have not used it because I need to purchase another set of heads.  This one comes with many different heads for different functions. We have used just about all of them to figure out which work best with her hardware.  My daughter really likes the pulsating massage function, she says it relieves the aches in her gums from the habit breaking bar.  I would recommend for teens or adults, but it is a bit messy for my 7 year old.</li>
    <li> Compact so it doesn&#x27;t take alot of counter space.  Works as advertised.  Good product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and does not just cleaning but also flossing and tissue massage. Came with 4 special tip that I need for periodontal care.</li>
    <li> On time and it works as advertised</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good! I&#x27;m happy with this useful product.  I&#x27;m just having a little difficult to handle it without making a mess with the water in my face but I guess this is just a matter of practice. So far so good!</li>
    <li> This is my second Water Pik and it&#x27;s even better than the old one</li>
    <li> Overall this works very well.  I&#x27;m still working on using all the features, but so far it&#x27;s been great. No more bleeding gums due to harsh floss.  It gets spots I always struggle to clean since I have a two fill ins. It&#x27;s worth the buy and I recommend it to a friend and she had actually already bought the same one. I&#x27;m happy with it. The only reason I rated a 4 star is I haven&#x27;t used all the features just yet.</li>
    <li> Just what the dentist wanted!</li>
    <li> Great product,  works as advertized</li>
    <li> Works great. I love that the extra tools are color coated so we can all keep track of our own. I love my wife, but I don&#x27;t want to use her water flosser top.</li>
    <li> This item has worked out great for me.</li>
    <li> Great water pic - cleans and massages the gums very well with choice of force for all mouths.</li>
    <li> Excellent and as described...</li>
    <li> Good product. Mum&amp;Dad love it. Want to buy it again.</li>
    <li> Have lots of bridges and the Water Pik makes all the difference in the world after brushing.</li>
    <li> Works better than expected.  Be prepared to drip water all over if you don&#x27;t follow the directions.</li>
    <li> Does a great job!  Should have bought one a long time ago!</li>
    <li> best investment ever! i just got braces and this makes it so much easier to clean</li>
    <li> Improve the health of my gums and eliminated the need for a deep cleaning of my teeth.</li>
    <li> Very effective. When I went to my dentist they told me &amp;#34;whatever you are doing, keep it up!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Awesome I have braces.... Great buy!!!</li>
    <li> I like it, easy to use and largely effective for quick cleaning after meals. I didn&#x27;t find, however, tools other than the flosser, such as picker and massager, were very useful.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a 35% improvement over my old one.  I like the looks of it , as well.</li>
    <li> Love it! I would absolutely reccomend this, it has great pressure and very easy to use.</li>
