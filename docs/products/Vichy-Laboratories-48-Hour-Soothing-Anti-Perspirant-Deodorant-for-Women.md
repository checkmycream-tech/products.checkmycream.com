      <li>Didn&#x27;t work for me, I still sweat and had huge stains on my clothes from sweating.</li>

      <li>Every time I need to re-order, the price intimidates me, but I&#x27;m quickly reminded that I have never found a product as reliable.  </li>
      <li>but it is worth it because unlike most deodorants, it works wonderfully without fail.</li>
      <li>So definitely worth the price.</li>

      <li>Works well, but it is sticky at first.</li>
      <li>I just purchased this item and threw in in my luggage on business trip to Savannah - used it the first day in lots of heat and humidity.  </li>
      <li>I apply it after the evening shower, and it definitely lasts more than 1 day.</li>
      <li>I first purchased it in St. Barts and have been a fan ever since.  </li>
      <li>Vichy Deodorant is only for once a day, and you feel comfortable and fresh for a day.</li>
      <li>It did not irritate my very sensitive skin, but it also didn&#x27;t last for more than a couple of hours.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I have a difficult time convincing myself that I should spend this much on deodorant, but it really is amazing.  </li>
      <li>I find that this does not irritate my skin, despite the aluminum it has, and it works reasonably well.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Afterwards there is no residue, no stains, and no odors, especially when exercising and sweating all day (I live in very very hot environment).</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have a sensitive skin, but it performed very well (no rash) immediately after epilation.</li>
      <li>, it is just plain and refreshing.</li>
      <li>Vichy Anti- Transpirant 48 h. Deodorant for Very Sensitive Skin</li>
      <li>and he finds the same positive outcome.  </li>
      <li>I use it right after the shower, and let it dry.</li>
      <li>I am extremely sensitive to deodorants and even &amp;#34;hypoallergenic&amp;#34; causes me to break out.  </li>
      <li>It actually works for 48 hours, it has no smell, and its not irritating at all.</li>
      <li>5 minutes before putting clothes on, so no stains so far.</li>
      <li>Its very gentle on skin,doesn&#x27;t leave stubborn white marks on clothes,and lasts for over a month with regular every day use.</li>
      <li>I live in the desert &amp; it&#x27;s currently 117</li>
      <li>A little pricey but worth the price.</li>
      <li>I wish it was aluminum-free but at least it seems to be not too full of junky ingredients.</li>
      <li>My particular issue with antiperspirants is not the aluminum, or at least it is only a certain compound of aluminum.  </li>

<li> I have very sensitive skin - even products for sensitive skin were irritating.  </li>
<li> I also let it dry for max.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this Anti-transpirant for about 2 years now, every single day without irritation or issue.  </li>
<li> It is a bit expensive, but within 3 or 4 days, I realized that it is well worth the money.  </li>
<li> I thought this will stay wet and sticky.  </li>
<li> The bottle is also small, so you might have a tiny heart attack when it arrives, but it lasts quite a while.  </li>
<li> In my profession, my days are very physically active.</li>
<li> So far it&#x27;s been at least a. Year!</li>
<li> You really do not need to apply it everyday.</li>
<li> It can be a bit irritating if you&#x27;ve got really sensitive skin, but nothing unbearable.</li>
<li> I won&#x27;t waste anymore of my money on any other anti-perspirants.</li>
<li> I do not stink even if I sweat through it due to heavy workouts.  </li>
<li> Typically I wear a deodorant for a year or so</li>
<li> Vichy is a little pricey</li>
<li> Also, the bottle is so small that it fits in the palm of my hand.  </li>
<li> I typically have a bad reaction to aluminum, and this was no different.  </li>
<li> Is non toxic, does not work hardly at all.</li>
<li> and it is delicate</li>
<li> but when I started to use it regularly I had very uncomfortable feeling under my arms</li>
<li> Though it has no added scents, it does have a subtle scent, which I do like.  </li>
<li> and I still stand behind this review.  </li>
<li> Waste of money :-(</li>
<li> horrible does not work and not worth the money</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had such hopes for this deodorant but it just did not work well. It did not irritate my very sensitive skin, but it also didn&#x27;t last for more than a couple of hours. Waste of money :-(</li>
    <li> I like this product for being efficient. I apply it after the evening shower, and it definitely lasts more than 1 day. I also let it dry for max. 5 minutes before putting clothes on, so no stains so far. There is no odor to it, but sometimes the sweat from around-the-protected area may influence the overall odor of the armpit. I don&#x27;t have a sensitive skin, but it performed very well (no rash) immediately after epilation. Great product, I am very happy to have found an efficient antiperspirant deodorant. And the Vichy brand is one of the best in skincare, as well.</li>
    <li> Vichy Deodorant is only for once a day, and you feel comfortable and fresh for a day. And I like the fact that it has no smell at all, it is just plain and refreshing. I use it every morning, and it lasts all day long.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. It doesn&#x27;t sting.  It works great.  Does not stain clothing.  Say good by to wetness.</li>
    <li> I discovered this product when I was vacationing in London.  The label indicated fragrance-free, alcohol-free, hypo-allergenic, and PARABEN-FREE(!).  That&#x27;s everything I want. In my profession, my days are very physically active. With this product miraculously I don&#x27;t perspire.  I find that I can even skip a day or two -- I couldn&#x27;t do that with most anti-perspirants. Also it goes on invisibly and does not stain my clothes.  I won&#x27;t waste anymore of my money on any other anti-perspirants. Vichy is a little pricey but it is worth it because unlike most deodorants, it works wonderfully without fail.</li>
    <li> It is great to have this item available for purchase in the US through Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a very good one too, I been using it for two year know and I&#x27;m very satisfied with it!</li>
    <li> This product is a wonderful.  I first purchased it in St. Barts and have been a fan ever since.  The product was shipped on the schedule promised and I buy it in bulk so I&#x27;m never without it.</li>
    <li> I found this antiperspirant in France and bought it online since then.  It is expensive but lasts much longer than an equally expensive american brand (secret prescription formula for sensitive skin) and does not cause me the same irritation (itching) while still working great.  It has absolutely no smell which, in my opinion, is a great thing.  Now my husband shares it with me and he finds the same positive outcome.  So definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this deodorant, truly, and I never bother to write reviews (even for things I really like). I would probably pay any price for the comfort and piece of mind this product gives me!</li>
    <li> I have tried all kinds of deodorants and antiperspirants and this product has exceeded my expectations! It actually works for 48 hours, it has no smell, and its not irritating at all.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I wish I could find in drugstores too.</li>
    <li> Since trying this product two years ago I have not used another deodorant.  The application is smooth, there is no scent and it does not mark clothes. You really do not need to apply it everyday.</li>
    <li> My particular issue with antiperspirants is not the aluminum, or at least it is only a certain compound of aluminum.  I find that this does not irritate my skin, despite the aluminum it has, and it works reasonably well.  I do not stink even if I sweat through it due to heavy workouts.  Though it has no added scents, it does have a subtle scent, which I do like.  For me, this product works well, and does not cause me to break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No antiperspirant is going to work for all people.  For me this is the ONLY thing I have found, currently on the market, that does not irritate, AND keeps me from being stinky.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Works well, but it is sticky at first. I use it right after the shower, and let it dry. Afterwards there is no residue, no stains, and no odors, especially when exercising and sweating all day (I live in very very hot environment).</li>
    <li> I am extremely sensitive to deodorants and even &amp;#34;hypoallergenic&amp;#34; causes me to break out.  I have used Vichy for over a month and have had no problems.  A little pricey but worth the price.</li>
    <li> I was looking to avoid aluminum altogether.  I typically have a bad reaction to aluminum, and this was no different.  I wish that the product details had been available at the time of purchase.  I took a chance and it didn&#x27;t work out.  Also, the bottle is so small that it fits in the palm of my hand.  I&#x27;m a short female, by the way.  It&#x27;s quite pricey for the size.  It does work for extended protection from odor, however.  That&#x27;s why I gave it 2 stars.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product because I believe in the brand and the quality. Trust me, it has definitely lived up to expectations and would do business again!</li>
    <li> Is unscented.  Is non toxic, does not work hardly at all.</li>
    <li> horrible does not work and not worth the money</li>
    <li> I love this product!  No smell and works great for up to two days.  No sting after shaving.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Got this based on the reviews. I&#x27;m from Europe and have seen this brand in stores/drugstores a lot but have never tried it. The deodorant seems to be working wonderfully! I have no smell at the end of the day. I wish it was aluminum-free but at least it seems to be not too full of junky ingredients.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this item and threw in in my luggage on business trip to Savannah - used it the first day in lots of heat and humidity.  It worked great no issues.</li>
    <li> One of the ONLY deodorants that works for me.  Typically I wear a deodorant for a year or so and then it stops working! I was happy to find one that holds up under any condition.  A blessing., I hope it lasts a long time.  So far it&#x27;s been at least a. Year!</li>
    <li> I used the product only twice then I got severe skin irritation that I still suffer from it till now.</li>
    <li> id never use anything else</li>
    <li> I discovered this product while traveling in Europe.  Was hesitant since i always use glide gels.  I thought this will stay wet and sticky.  Ogh no, it is just amazing.  Best part yet it is so good for my sensitive skin.  ..and if i forget to use it no problem since it lasts 48 hrs.  Genius!!!!!</li>
    <li> Vichy Anti- Transpirant 48 h. Deodorant for Very Sensitive Skin i like it very much. it works well and it is delicate</li>
    <li> Fabulous! It works all day and to through a workout at Pilates. I apply it daily with no irritation, nice to be fragrance free since I enjoy nice colognes.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re trying to decide if you should buy this, you should.  It is a bit expensive, but within 3 or 4 days, I realized that it is well worth the money.  It can be a bit irritating if you&#x27;ve got really sensitive skin, but nothing unbearable.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin - even products for sensitive skin were irritating.  So far no irritation and is very effective.</li>
    <li> it;s ok to use it once in a while but when I started to use it regularly I had very uncomfortable feeling under my arms and it didn&#x27;t protect me that good either.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my sensitive armpits</li>
    <li> I have a difficult time convincing myself that I should spend this much on deodorant, but it really is amazing.  It isn&#x27;t harsh, isn&#x27;t drying and completely protects against sweating &amp; wetness.  I live in the desert &amp; it&#x27;s currently 117 and I still stand behind this review.  The stuff that you can purchase online from the US is only 24hr and it smells like flowers.  I have severe allergies and cannot stand to smell like flowers or fruit or anything chemically smelling.  I&#x27;ve been using this Anti-transpirant for about 2 years now, every single day without irritation or issue.  Every time I need to re-order, the price intimidates me, but I&#x27;m quickly reminded that I have never found a product as reliable.  The bottle is also small, so you might have a tiny heart attack when it arrives, but it lasts quite a while.  I always order a 2-pack, but would happily order a 6 pack or a case if it was offered.  If more stars were an option, I would give them towards this particular review.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, I still sweat and had huge stains on my clothes from sweating. It was only about a 2 hr deodorant.</li>
    <li> This is great deodorant,I&#x27;ve been using it for years.Its very gentle on skin,doesn&#x27;t leave stubborn white marks on clothes,and lasts for over a month with regular every day use.Highly recommended!</li>
