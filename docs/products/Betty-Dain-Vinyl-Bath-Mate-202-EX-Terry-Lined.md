      <li>I&#x27;m glad I choose this one</li>
      <li>I really love this product.  </li>
      <li>I will be getting a couple more for traveling purposes.  </li>
      <li>Do better on the lining</li>
      <li>but they switched the elastic around the side, so more water leaks in</li>
      <li>I use it mostly when I&#x27;m on trips with my long distance boyfriend and knew the hotel ones wouldn&#x27;t hold up and didn&#x27;t look very good on me.</li>
      <li>Fabulous shower cap and fantastic quick service - thank you!</li>
      <li>She liked it so much that I ordered one for myself</li>
      <li>Love the Large size!  </li>
      <li>hesitated to spend this much money on a shower cap, but I have to admit that I&#x27;m glad that I did.  </li>
      <li>It looks much cuter and girlier, which fit the request, and does a great job at keeping my hair dry.</li>
      <li>The terry cloth is much too thin.otherwise it would be fine.</li>
      <li>Well...this cap is worth EVERY penny.  </li>
      <li>And can be tossed in the wash to keep it smelling fresh</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d been using the clear, disposable ones I&#x27;d gotten from hotel rooms for many years.</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t fit into my toilet tree bags, and it leaves an indent across the top of my forehead for about 20 minutes after from the snug elastic.</li>
      <li>But on amazon it says right there that I was ordering  a terry lined shower cap.  </li>
      <li>The band that keeps the water out REALLY keeps the water out!</li>
      <li>Works great at keeping my long hair completely dry.</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t find any this large in the stores.  </li>
      <li>Fits fairly large, I have short hair, but it will be fine.  </li>
      <li>Thanks,</li>
      <li>This one is very different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Terry cloth doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
      <li>Very roomy, fits close, and voila, no wet hair.</li>
      <li>Not small like some of the others I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
      <li>The terry cloth inner lining keeps your hair dry by soaking up any moisture and the vinyl covering is soft and comfortable.</li>
      <li>old Mother.  </li>
      <li>The only downsides are it&#x27;s very bulky to carry around,</li>
      <li>Not as large as expected, but it works</li>
      <li>This cap handles my long thick hair with ease and is very comfortable to wear.</li>
      <li>usually wear my hair in its (wild and curly) natural state, but for those times when I break out the dryer and the flat iron, it&#x27;s good to know that my hard work won&#x27;t be ruined by a defective cap.  </li>
      <li>It will last me a very time long.</li>
      <li>Very snug fit without being uncomfortable, and it does its job the way it&#x27;s supposed</li>
      <li>Those fit children&#x27;s heads or people with hardly any hair!  </li>

<li> I had been looking for a long time for shower cap for my 100yr.</li>
<li> I tried other (cheaper) shower caps and found them to be too small for my long thick hair and also cheaply made...</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a tiny bit tight on my face, but I suppose that it has to be to keep your hair dry.</li>
<li> Rather spend less and get something simple.</li>
<li> , my hair NEVER gets wet.  </li>
<li> Its not too tight either.</li>
<li> Too Small for my head-</li>
<li> I have thick medium length hair</li>
<li> I received a thin vinyl cap, not the one I ordered.</li>
<li> I have long curly hair - impossible before to get all of it in a shower cap until now!  </li>
<li> Weird</li>
<li> I hate shower caps because they almost always allow a leak somewhere.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works great at keeping my long hair completely dry. And can be tossed in the wash to keep it smelling fresh, althought the flowers do fade in time (don&#x27;t they always).</li>
    <li> The terry cloth is much too thin.otherwise it would be fine. It would b nicer with heavier terrycloth. Do better on the lining</li>
    <li> Too Small for my head- lol!</li>
    <li> Love the Large size!  Couldn&#x27;t find any this large in the stores.  Those fit children&#x27;s heads or people with hardly any hair!  Great quality &amp; construction.  Looks great, too!</li>
    <li> This is a great shower cap. Very roomy, fits close, and voila, no wet hair. Weird</li>
    <li> Terry cloth doesn&#x27;t do much. Rather spend less and get something simple.</li>
    <li> never, never a leak!  It&#x27;s a tiny bit tight on my face, but I suppose that it has to be to keep your hair dry.</li>
    <li> I tried other (cheaper) shower caps and found them to be too small for my long thick hair and also cheaply made...you get what you pay for.  Well...this cap is worth EVERY penny.  I love it !  I will never get another brand again.  This cap handles my long thick hair with ease and is very comfortable to wear.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product...I will be getting a couple more for traveling purposes.  I really love this product.  It fits over my hair rollers when I shower.  Thanks,</li>
    <li> I received a thin vinyl cap, not the one I ordered. When I  contacted them, they said it&lt;br /&gt;does not come lined!  But on amazon it says right there that I was ordering  a terry lined shower cap.  Dont buy, they are liars and will not help me.  Rip off.....</li>
    <li> Fabulous shower cap and fantastic quick service - thank you!</li>
    <li> Not as large as expected, but it works</li>
    <li> This shower cap is roomy enough so hair is not smashed, and the terry lining prevents the &#x27;steamed&#x27; look after showering.  Great find!</li>
    <li> Great quality, generous size to cover hair.</li>
    <li> Not small like some of the others I&#x27;ve purchased.  Should have bought extra one for a spare. Will purchase again when needed.</li>
    <li> Simply the best shower cap I have ever found. It actually keeps your hair dry!</li>
    <li> Been buying these for years but they switched the elastic around the side, so more water leaks in</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a long time for shower cap for my 100yr. old Mother.  She liked it so much that I ordered one for myself</li>
    <li> A very good product. The terry cloth inner lining keeps your hair dry by soaking up any moisture and the vinyl covering is soft and comfortable.</li>
    <li> Best shower cap I have ever owned! Great seal around the edge, my hair NEVER gets wet.  Its not too tight either. They quality of the plastic and terry cloth liner is very good.  I have thick medium length hair and I am very happy with this purchase!</li>

I can recommend trying this one with no reservations.</li>
    <li> I deliberated over which shower cap to buy for a while. I&#x27;d been using the clear, disposable ones I&#x27;d gotten from hotel rooms for many years. I use it mostly when I&#x27;m on trips with my long distance boyfriend and knew the hotel ones wouldn&#x27;t hold up and didn&#x27;t look very good on me. So I bought this one. It looks much cuter and girlier, which fit the request, and does a great job at keeping my hair dry. It will last me a very time long. The only downsides are it&#x27;s very bulky to carry around, doesn&#x27;t fit into my toilet tree bags, and it leaves an indent across the top of my forehead for about 20 minutes after from the snug elastic. I&#x27;m glad I choose this one and I&#x27;d recommend it to others but I do wish it packed smaller in my bag.</li>
    <li> Fits fairly large, I have short hair, but it will be fine.  Someone with long hair will like this too.</li>
    <li> I have long curly hair - impossible before to get all of it in a shower cap until now!  Love It!</li>
