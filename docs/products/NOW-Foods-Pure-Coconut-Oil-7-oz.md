<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Now products have become a staple in my household and this oil does not disappoint. I have used it to moisturize my skin and hair.</li>
    <li> This oil is great.. Love this product you can use it all over your body..hair,face,skin, nails, etc...&lt;br /&gt;I love my coconut oil... : )</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe how soft and smooth it makes my skin!</li>
    <li> i use it for everything! great for your hair and better than my burts bees body lotion. makes an excellent face moisturizer and is great to fry foods with has a positive impact on people with thyroid issues</li>
    <li> Small jar for the price but the product still works!</li>
    <li> It came on time pretty good &amp; i heard that coconut oil makes your hair grow so i thought i would give it a try. I works really well if u have dry hair i recomend it..it doesnt smell like coconuts (i was hoping it would) but i didnt read close enough to see it was &amp;#34;deoderized&amp;#34; anyways, i really like this product</li>
    <li> Has been great for my skin. Better than any acne medicine out there!!</li>
    <li> I Love this for my Natural Hair. The Coconut Oil gave me shine, thickness and growth.</li>
    <li> Made great Christmas presents for the ladies in my family.</li>
    <li> Good for my face a feet .. No smell which is good !</li>
    <li> This oil is great! Lightweight, and easily converted to liquid if need be. Also if you aren&#x27;t a fan of the scented oil, this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> It works great on my face. I&#x27;m not sure why everyone is bummed that is doesn&#x27;t smell like coconut. I&#x27;m okay with that. It&#x27;s great to warm up and put in your hair before a warm shower. My scalp gets dry wearing a winter hat all day and the oil helps a lot. I have very sensitive skin and love that the coconut oil does not make my skin greasy and prone to acne. It definitely has a shine to it if you choose not wear make up, but for the ups and downs of the winter weather....it works for me!</li>
    <li> Love this it&#x27;s oily but wonderful, for my hair. Rub in Palm and it loosens ip</li>
    <li> I use coconut oils in the past, but this one is the best I purchase.  If you keep this in a cool place it won&#x27;t stay in solid form which I love.  Whenever I need it I can just grab it and apply to my skin or hair.  This is a MUST BUY no heavy scent no irration for my skin and I have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I use it as a moisturizer and it&#x27;s amazing. Also, a small amount under the eyes helps moisturize since the skin is thinner. I&#x27;ve noticed my dark circles lighten and have been religiously using with my day and night routine for close to a month.</li>
    <li> delivered on time as promised and product meets quality as expectation as described! Will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Just what the doctor ordered. Many wonderful uses and also a healthy food.</li>
    <li> This coconut oil completely looses its smell after a few weeks. Strange</li>
    <li> excellent product. I use this on my face in the morning or before I go to bed. Also to brush my toddlers teeth.</li>
    <li> excellent product.  makes a wonderful moisturizer for your skin.  calmed down the itching on my scalp.</li>
    <li> Great brand, no problems with delivery or packaging. However, I purchased this for use on skin after reading numerous blogs stating it is wonderful for that. This oil does not absorb quickly at all. Sesame and olive oil both absorb quicker.  Maybe it&#x27;s great for cooking?</li>
    <li> I use this on my hair before I wash it and have had great results.  When you get it will be completely solid, but zap it in the microwave (without the lid!) for 30 seconds and it will turn liquid.  I literally dunk my ends in and wring them out then put my hair in a bun for about 20 minutes and then shower.  Shampoo removes all the residue, but your hair will be more hydrated and my ends look much better.  There&#x27;s no smell whatsoever and this jar is about the size of Nutella, so there might be a better value out there, but I&#x27;m really impressed with the purity of this brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other products and have found that this is the best product on the market! Ordered my second jar. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> Works great as a hair conditioner and gets rid of those little white bumps on upper arms.</li>
    <li> Excellent for my skin and hair</li>
    <li> I like this Coconut oil very much, it helped to soothe my scrapes and burns. It is also a very good moisturizer for my hair and body, and I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a sent which makes it even better!!</li>
    <li> I been using this product for a week now on my skin and nails, my skin is so much smoother not dry any more. My nails are getting stronger no more dry peeling nails .</li>
    <li> This great for skin and as use as a hair mask. Make hair shiny and gives skin a nice sheen ( I am a natural blonde with a half wavy/ half curly dry hair type). Love that this brand has no extra junk in it like artificial preservative or mineral oil. Love to blend it with essential treatment oils for a scalp massage weekly or blend with other scented body butter that I want to be more moisturizing. Great for cuticles and dry nails during winter.</li>
    <li> I would have given this 5 stars, but I love the smell of coconut and missed any mention of this being de-fragranced. As I was purchasing to make my own mustache wax, I thought the coconut would lend it a great scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, aside from my minor inconvenience, I have to say it&#x27;s great stuff. Mixed up a bit with some beeswax to control the handlebars and I have to say, it&#x27;s never been softer. That it&#x27;s food grade means I&#x27;ve very happy to have it near the mouth, which I worry about with some of the other formulations out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you wanted to try it alone on a mustache, it&#x27;s lots of fun in cold weather to feel the oil suddenly solidify at the first blast of cool air. :)</li>
    <li> It has no scent, i personally would have preferred a hint of the coconut smell but an ok product overall</li>
    <li> Coconut oil is just that, and the jar is glass (which is heavier but reusable and prettier than a plastic jar).</li>
    <li> My hair stays very dry so my beautician recommend this product. It really keeps moisture in the hair great product.</li>
    <li> you can use this for your hair, scalp, and skin and it feel so good on the body. The scent is mild but the oil is thick when at room temp and turns into liquid when heat is added.</li>
    <li> it said liquid , it&#x27;s not.  oil don&#x27;t solidify.  I &#x27;ll use it.  to rub on my skin after a shower.</li>
    <li> I dont know wht this thing is but def not coconut oil,its runny and greasy i order this for my hairs but not happy with this product doesnt have any smell at all even doesnt have ingredient list or anything on bottle!! Save ur money</li>
    <li> Reduces breakage when doing pre-poo treatment and is a great sealer when locking in moisture for my natural hair</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know any better oil for dry skin</li>
    <li> This is amazing stuff.  I use it with hair conditioner and left it on overnight and wore a shower cap - my hair was amazingly soft. I use several facial products so I have also used it on my face and hands.  It is very light and not greasy - but definitely a good moisturizing product.</li>
    <li> This oil is extremely greasy, like it drips though scarfs and pillow cases. This oil is going to the trash is melts like crazy and it is completely liquified now.</li>
    <li> I grew up with the raw coconut out that had the smell. I like that this does not smell.</li>
    <li> Shipping was very fast for this product. Only thing is the top was very very very hard to take off. I had to get my husband to take it off, then ten minutes later, it sealed back up in the shower and I couldnt get the top off again. It took another five minutes to get the top off. So I just leave it in my shower without a top on because Im not dealing with the top closing on me when I need to use it. I use this product for my hair. My hair is very dry from to much bleaching, but I can see a difference now from only useing this product three times. Only thing is, it leaves my hair greasy the next day when I blow dry it. But that means its working I guess.</li>
    <li> Good for my skin and hair love it!</li>
    <li> tried this coconut oil because of the low price and did not disappoint. Was pure, completely clear when hot, then completely white when cooled. The thing i really liked about this product is it came in a glass container so none of those nasty chemicals could leach into the oil from the plastic container.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been great on my hair and and skin. Love it.</li>
    <li> Feels so good but absorbs so fast. I wish it was more like a lotion. t does feel nice on the skin when first applied but you will need to keep reapplying if you like moist skin.</li>
    <li> I have made the decision to go natural starting Feb 2012 and I needed to make sure I was keeping hair moisturized. After researching and You-Tubing natural hair,I purchased this product and I absolutely love how soft and managable my hair is with this product.</li>
    <li> I use it on my hair (perm) and skin, and it&#x27;s nice to your skin after shaving.  If you have a scratch or eczema, this moisturizes without irritating.  I think I&#x27;m going to be able to empty my medicine cabinet of my other oils and lotions.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use on acne-prone faces - your pores will get clogged</li>
    <li> Very good product,can be used in so many ways( hair and skin etc)&lt;br /&gt;. I do wish the jar was much bigger.</li>
    <li> Fresh clean and ready to use for all my DIY skin care items.</li>
    <li> Great Coconut Oil, I like the feel of it not like others that I have ordered, no rock like pebbles in it, smooth on the skin.</li>
    <li> Great oil, I use this in my home made beard oil and it works great to help stop itching and flaking.</li>
    <li> This product is great for dry hair and skin! I use it on my face daily. At first I used too much but a small bit will go a long way. It&#x27;s a great product that I would of have five stars but the lid on the jar is very hard to open. I now leave the lid barely screwed on to accommodate this but it was a big annoyance the first few times.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff use it for everything.  Hair, face, moisturizer!</li>
    <li> Perfect for dry skin and minor abrasions.  I will continue to purchase this item until the end of time.  Thank you so much for housing this product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE This stuff it works great for skin problems</li>
    <li> oh my gosh, I love NOW products. I ordered 4 and already used them out. Will be ordering more later. I use it on my hair, my skin, in my body wash. I just love it. Good texture as well.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT HELPS WITH MY DRUG SKIN!!</li>
    <li> Amazing product!!!! :-)</li>
    <li> I love this product so much, that I am going to order the largest size they have. I use it on my hair, my skin, my dog&#x27;s fur, and several other areas. Coconut oil has so many benefits that I use in so many other ways.</li>
    <li> I use a lot of organic coconut oil. I was suprised by how expensive this jar is suppose to other online vendors.</li>
    <li> I initially bought this product intending to use it to moisturize my hair as a pre-shampoo treatment as well as to seal in my hair products after I apply them. Though it worked fine in my hair, the coconut oil is deodorized, so it has no smell (which is sort of weird). I was really looking for that coconut smell and since it was deodorized, it made my question if it was even real coconut oil at all. I also wasn&#x27;t sure if this product was extra virgin, cold-pressed, and unrefined so I opted for another brand instead. However, it works great for moisturizing my skin, especially sensitive areas like on my tattoo and on scabs/dry areas. So, if you don&#x27;t mind the deodorized scent, I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I order this product all the time. The jar of coconut oil that I received was 25% empty.</li>
    <li> The oil itself is okay but why isn&#x27;t the ingredients labeled on it? So is it 100% natural but it&#x27;s not 100% coconut oil?&lt;br /&gt;NOT okay.</li>
    <li> This is high quality coconut oil. I use this coconut oil for a homemade deodorant recipe.  I keep it in the refrigerator and it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> works really well on hair and skin. Don;t need to use a lot, just a little works great.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after a youtube guru mentioned how much she liked this product.&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised by the solid state of substance, but it came with microwave instructions and was very simple to use.&lt;br /&gt;I use this as an overnight hair treatment on the ends of my hair and I love the results.</li>
    <li> One was open and was all over package. It has small beads that want melt down</li>
    <li> I use it to moisturize my hair and it&#x27;s working wonders.</li>
    <li> Love it I use it on my hair!</li>
    <li> I never bought it before so I don&#x27;t know how it is supposed to be but I think it is ok for what I need it for.</li>
    <li> Good. Does the job of coconut oil but because it&#x27;s unscented, it&#x27;s not as lovely and I wouldn&#x27;t really eat it. Also, it feels harder and thicker than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Sucks leave the hair stinky... Thought that it was like grease but no....</li>
    <li> Love it my skin my hair look Wesome.&lt;br /&gt;Def gonna buy again great product.</li>
    <li> Works great for hair and skin, melts quickly in your hands. Even has a nice smell to it. Love it!</li>
    <li> Not sure about this brand</li>
    <li> Great coconut oil. I use it for my hair and body , actually next time I will get a larger container . Love this stuff</li>
    <li> This stuff leaves my skin silky smooth. I love it and i definitely recommend it to those who battle with dry skin.</li>
    <li> Pros: 100% Pure Coconut Oil, clear, fragrance free, lots to play around with&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: After using it the lid will get stuck and wont open. Hint, use a spoon to get the oil out, do not pour oil out of jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to use as a hair oil. I poured some into a small bowl and mixed it with my jojoba oil. I really liked how my hair came out. When I was ready to make use this again, I tried to open this jar but the lid was stuck. Turns out when I poured this into the bowl, the oil was on the rim of the jar. After placing the lid back on the jar the oil must have dried under the lid making the lid stuck to the rim. I have to fight and fight, place the jar with the lid still stuck on it under warm water to melt the oil thats under the lid. Bang the edge of the lid on the corner of a counter just to get it open. By the time I get this thing open my arms and wrist hurt from all of the twisting.</li>
    <li> So me and coconut oil: I cook with it, I put it in my body oil, and in my hair. Love it</li>
    <li> I tried using it for oil pulling.  Made me sick to my stomach.</li>
    <li> Love coconut oil I use it for my hair and skin and it works wonders. However, the jar is difficult to open so don&#x27;t close it all the way.</li>
    <li> Coconut oil has many different uses, I use it as a beauty product. The description is accurate, and it shipped really fast.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS, MY GOODNESS, IT MOISTURIZES MY NATURAL HAIR SO WELL, I USE PRE-POO TREATMENT, AND ALSO TO MOISTURIZE MY HAIR WHILE SETTING IT ALSO !!! LOVE THIS COCONUT OIL</li>
    <li> Love coconut oil..it makes my hair so soft</li>
    <li> I use this to mix with my essential oils and rub in to my skin. It is really nice and melts quickly on contact as well as seems to absorb in to my skin fairly quickly. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> overly oily for my hair - start by using sparingly</li>
    <li> I have been experimenting with ingredients for a facial-make-me-look-30-again skin cr&amp;egrave;me.  This coconut oil is not the answer in it&#x27;s self, but will be part of my concoction.  I tried using it right out of the jar and it feels so-o-o-o good! until I began sweating and it pretty much melted.  I have not used it for cooking, but certainly will be adding it for skin care.</li>
    <li> Shipped promptly and was exactly as described. Good quality for a good price.</li>
    <li> It works really well for my hair and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> High quality coconut oil for cooking, skin treatment. Very clear when warm and white when cold.</li>
    <li> No smell! Not good for cooking!</li>
    <li> IMO, it&#x27;s not a good quality.  In its melted state, it had turned to a grayish color. I will stick with the extra virgin coconut oil and give this away.</li>
    <li> Now foods coconut oil is by far one of the best products I have ever purchased. Before using this particular coconut oil, my hair was very dry, frizzy, and thinned out. I began using now foods coconut oil a couple times a week as a deep conditioner for my hair. Since then my hair has become much more full and shiny. My hair is so healthy. I have people constantly asking me what did I do to my hair! I love the fact that it is pure. There are no additives or chemicals added. It&#x27;s 100% pure coconut oil. I plan on using now foods coconut oil as a moisturizer for my newborn&#x27;s skin!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with product!!! my hair absolutely loves it. Received before expected</li>
    <li> This works great and I really appreciate that it comes in a glass jar instead of plastic.</li>
    <li> This oil is fine but not even close to the Natures Way brand. I won&#x27;t order this brand again.</li>
    <li> I have natural hair &amp; I heard that coconut oil is great for retaining moisture. This product truly did the trick. The coconut oil arrived in liquid form bc of the hot temps outside but returned to solid form after a few hours. To use it in liquid form all you have to do is put the container in warm water for 30 minutes. I applied the oil to my dry hair &amp; let it sit for a couple of hours. After I rinsed the oil from my hair, I shampooed &amp; deep conditioned. My hair was soft &amp; moisturized for about a week. I love it. Must for naturals!</li>
    <li> this is a aazing product i think everybody should be useing this it workswonder on any thing i told every body about this</li>
    <li> Love this coconut oil for so many uses!!!</li>
    <li> Got the product quickly, at a good price, and am currently using it for a pinterest project that I found!!!</li>
    <li> This product is great for skin and hair... I really love the way it make your hair and skin feel daily. The seller shipped the product right away....Great product!</li>
    <li> Great product. I use it as a sealant for my hair, and for skin and oil pulling as well.</li>
    <li> so many uses for coconut oil. it&#x27;s made my skin and hair softer and a little goes a long way. great product for the price! would recommend</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Smells horrible. Not raw or natural.</li>
    <li> This dissolves well on skin and scalp. I love the feeling afterwards not greasy just smooth and your scalp is no longer itchy.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. I love how many uses there are for coconut oil! Also, with this one, it&#x27;s just coconuts so you can literally use it for everything from conditioner, to lotion, to oil for cooking. ;)</li>
    <li> I love this product, useful in many ways.  I love it for my hair and skin.  great mosturizer.  shipped fast.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about three weeks and I absolutely love it! I use it for both skin and hair treatment. I noticed a huge difference especially on my hair. I noticed my hair was looking dry and unhealthy and decided to try coconut oil after doing some research. I came across this product and took my chances. I only use a small amount and place on my hair 30-40 minutes before showering. I immediately saw/felt a difference. It feels so smooth and gives it a nice shiney look to my hair. It now looks and feels great. It helped a lot with my frizzyness as well!!! Oh my boyfriend also uses this product and I even ordered him one since he wouldn&#x27;t stop using mine! Great buy!</li>
    <li> This is very nice, and although oily, absorbs into the skin almost immediately!  Also, there&#x27;s no scent!  I purchased some salt scrub a couple of years ago, and it dried out for one reason or another.  I purchased this to add back to the salt scrub, and it worked!  I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> used it all up and need more for the home made wonderful goodies we make just for our family to use.</li>
    <li> love this stuff. i use it for my hair and combine it with lotion. works wonders</li>
    <li> I bought this for my hair and it worked out great. It is a great moisturizer! Also I used it on my skin and it made my legs really soft! The item shipped immediately and took only two days to arrive to my house!! I recommend it!</li>
    <li> No coconut scent but will have to due for now</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dry skkin and I have been faithfulling using it on my hands ans legs after a bath it feels so nice and my skin looks great..</li>
    <li> This stuff is a really nice oil to use for sealing hair after moisturizing. I love this stuff. Goes a long way and has a multipurpose.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping. Oil is not as flavorful as other brands. I like to taste a hint of coconut but I don&#x27;t with this oil.</li>
    <li> love the was it makes my skin feel after a shower, i also mix a very little bit of tamanu oil with this in another jar best mix ever i just love this coconut oil very good product</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the purchase of of this product and would recommend Now Foods Coconut Oil Pure to anyone with dry skin. The skin feels soft and no sign of dryness may not be the same for everyone.</li>
    <li> I think the price was good and the delivery was fast. I didn&#x27;t love the coconut oil but It&#x27;s good for cooking. I bought it for my skin and hair but I need something more moisturizing.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t moisturize the way I&#x27;d like. Even when I used it on my skin (I bought this for my hair), to me, it just sat on the surface of my skin/scalp. Normal baby oil was absorbed into and made my skin softer and smooth. This just sat there. My mom uses it, I guess it works better with her? I won&#x27;t give it a bad rating, because some products, better suit different people.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a major supporter of NOW Foods products line for going on two years, especially their oils, glycerin and Vitamin D softcaps.  I like the coconut oil a lot when I do my overnight prepoos a day before shampooing.  My hair feels really soft and even makes detangling breeze too.  I also use it a sealant after moisturizing and sometimes for daily shine.  Melts fast in hands without fighting too much with the chunkiness and smells nice too.  I bought 2 jars awhile ago and planning to invest in more jars in the future as long as the price stay respectable.</li>
    <li> This oil is great as I already knew coconut oil is great for strengthening hair and making it thicker. Its helping my edges grow back and also works great for sealing my edges. I has no scent and makes hair look shiny and soft and healthy. Mine came solid but once I melted it it stayed liquid after microwaving for 20 seconds. I use everyday on my temples and whole scalp and wash out every 2 days. The only way it could be better  is if it were organic</li>
    <li> The product itself is great! I use it for my lobes and to help keep them healthy.&lt;br /&gt;But when I got it in the mail it had melted and was all over the box. It looked like the seal hadn&#x27;t broken too much when I looked at it. These are in glass jars too, so I checked for cracks, but it was in good shape. It think the heat of it being in a mail truck probably had something to do with it, so I wasn&#x27;t too worried. I&#x27;ve had no problems after that, and use it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good product and I recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of coconut but this didn&#x27;t give off much smell. It is great for using in the shower and rubbing all over. I use it for skin and hair.</li>
    <li> makes my skin and hair so soft!  I love that it is multi purpose so you really get your moneys worth</li>
    <li> i just love this oil it works on skin and hair. ive recently become natural so i use it more for my hair. it works wonders and it was shipped and arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> I love it it got rid of my dandruff in just one application...and i use it for moistorizing my body, for lipchap and for my hands...</li>
    <li> Works great on hair skin I used it for my daughters hair and skin right after shower and lasting shine and moisture</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not happy with the product I received.  I&#x27;ve purchased NOW from a local health food store before so when I opened my package I was concerned that the color wasn&#x27;t right.  It was yellow instead of clear with a bit of cloudy to signify that the product was solidifying.  When I opened the jar there wasn&#x27;t a scent at all much less a smell of coconut.  You would think that when it says 100% coconut oil it would actually smell like coconut, but that wasn&#x27;t the case in this instance.  I&#x27;m very disappointed and will not buy from this company again.</li>
    <li> Slow delivery but good product</li>
    <li> Love this brand of natural coconut oil. It has done wonders for my skin and hair. The only thing that has cleared up my sometimes acne prone/normal to oily combination skin. I will be buying again but my only complaint is the jar cover. It is extremely hard to get off for a weak 105 lb woman like myself...lol. I just wish it was easier to open. I would&#x27;ve given 5 stars if that wasn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
    <li> i think I prefer it to still smell and taste like coconut sometimes.</li>
    <li> This is such a great product! I have added it to my hair care routine and my hair couldn&#x27;t be happier. So soft and moisturized. I use it quite a bit with my lavender oil (power combo) and I still have enough to last me months from now. I love it and encourage others to invest in it</li>
    <li> It has helped my skin so much I bought this because I was starting to have dry skin patches and it has cleared them all up . I especially like using it on my face what a great moisturizer without feeling greasy and you only need to use a very little bit.</li>
    <li> This is cold pressed food grade coconut oil, but I use it as a moisturizer. And really I never see myself going back to commercial lotions that cost so much more and contain who knows what chemicals. Arrived in a box, well covered from sun.  Love.</li>
    <li> It came in a day early, which was fantastic! It smells natural (no perfume smell). It is one of the best oils I have used! I plan on buying more once I finish the jar!</li>
    <li> This oil is great for cooking and as promised - high smoking heat and is very pure. The problem is that the lid is impossible to open. It takes me 5 minutes with an opener. That&#x27;s very inconvenient for cooking.</li>
    <li> It works really well to keep my skin soft and ends of hair from drying out.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Used this to make sugar and salt shrubs for Christmas with essential oils. It is great.</li>
    <li> However, it leaked from the top of the bottle, I believe it had fallen somehow! But its okay,</li>
    <li> This coconut oil is great. I used a lot of it for my hair and sometimes after shaving. So far so good. I would repurchase.</li>
    <li> i bought this particular brand because of its size.  i needed a pure coconut oil in a 7 oz container.  i really like this brand.  i use it daily for many things.  many thanks to all.</li>
    <li> Greasy and didn&#x27;t soak in</li>
    <li> I love this product. It works great for my cuticles.</li>
    <li> Love it! Fast shipping, great product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is basically magic in a jar! Originally I was worried about the size not being enough, but it was honestly plenty. I use it as a conditioner and moisturizer and am loving the results!</li>
    <li> good purchase. i use it on my skin and i like it. i bought a different brand when i was done with this jar and i like this jar better.</li>
    <li> This was a pretty good purchase, not as good as food grade Coconut Oil, but serves its purpose pretty well.</li>
    <li> I love how this product doesn&#x27;t smell like coconut so you can use it on your hair freely.</li>
    <li> I was pleased this product arrived early. However, I was expecting creamy or an oil and it&#x27;s a solid. It has to be melted down whenever you want to use it and I don&#x27;t like having to do that as I bought this product to mix with other oils to use on my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using small amounts of this in my hair after showering (I have thick, curly, dark, coarse hair) and it seems like for the first time in my life, the frizz is manageable, and my hair is soft and shiny.  I just wish it wasn&#x27;t descented!</li>
    <li> Great on skin. Makes skin feel soft.  I also use on hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the purpose of using it in a sugar scrub with other natural oils and it was perfect.  It is  also good as a moisuterizer.  Goes on light and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This coconut oil is very pure, fragrance-free, and effective. I use it on my hair and it makes it grow and feel so soft. Make sure to store it at room temperature or higher because when it is hard, it&#x27;s hard. It&#x27;s not paste-like compared to other brands. If it is hard, it makes it very difficult to scoop out of the jar.</li>
    <li> Coconut oil goodness without the rancid smell after a few days. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> This stuff moisturizes my hair like all the people who rave about it. I have added it to my hygiene routine where after I shower I put some on my lower parts lol both my lower parts. I have found that it completely eliminates odor. Like if I don&#x27;t take a shower for like 2 days I still don&#x27;t smell. Umm however I cannot oil pull with this.</li>
    <li> This product is used to seal my moisturizer in my hair. It melts very quickly.  You can hardly smell the coconut, and it is not greasy at all. This is great for your skin as well. Give it a try and I believe you will love it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to help moisturize my hair.  I found it is also a great skin moisturizer.  My only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t smell like coconut at all.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed when I received this coconut oil because it was not in the form of a fluid as described.  It&#x27;s a hard white form of coconut oil.  I know when I&#x27;ve ordered castor oil or avocado oil, it was definitely in liquid form.  However, if you rub it in your hands, it does break down into an oily lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I gave this four stars only because it clearly says it&#x27;s 7 FLUID ounces and it&#x27;s not.  Other than that, I&#x27;ll have to see if I can warm it up for my specific needs.  It&#x27;s still a great product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this too much. It was tasteless and just not what I would expect in coconut oil. On the bright side if you wnant something you can use on your skin that will help moisturize it then this might work. Kind of greasy.</li>
    <li> The product came quicker than i thought it would and I&#x27;m very satisfied, yes i will order again, my skin is very smooth and looks beautiful</li>
    <li> another outstanding product from Now foods, I use for health and beauty purpose, not for consumption.  I&#x27;m not sure this is food grade or not, but that&#x27;s not necessary for me.  I use it for skin, nails and hair.</li>
    <li> There is no smell really</li>
    <li> VCOs should be the same regardless you apply to the skin or consume directly with a spoon out of the jar. This is a low grade, processed VCO with no nutritional value sold as a beauty product which is very misleading since if the VCO is missing its nutrients then it will not have the impact as it should internally or externally on human body regardless. Not even a USDA organic since it&#x27;s facilities not up to standards of most VCOs producers that sell USDA VCO for less.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product although I should have read closer as I wanted the coconut smell. I use it on my hair and it does not seem to weigh too heavily unlike some other oils. The lid is very hard to open at times so I can only recommend leaving it a little loose. Even my hubby could not get it open a few times and he&#x27;s usually my solution to that little problem.  They should definitely fix the packaging, that will certainly cause some buyers to waste their money. Can&#x27;t use it from inside the jar.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent. This product moisturize my skin well and my scalp plus it keeps the Mosquitos from biting me thank God.</li>
    <li> The Amazon title says this is in a liquid form, but mine jar came rock hard. The directions on the jar tell you that the contents may harden. To soften submerge the jar in hot water for 30 minutes or removed the lid and put it in the microwave for a few seconds. However, the coconut oil will harden again. This is very frustrating. I&#x27;ve settled for using an old teaspoon to scrape off a bit, which I warm between my palms. Then I apply it to my face and use a warm cloth to remove the coconut oil and make up, etc. I also want to use it on my hair for a moisturizing treatment, but I&#x27;ll have to melt the oil before it can be applied to my hair. Despite using using this coconut oil for its natural moisturizing properties, I find my skin isn&#x27;t very soft after using it.</li>
    <li> After a long hot shower I love to lather this on my skin. I love to be natural and I am a vegetarian so I don&#x27;t like using over-the-counter moisturizers.</li>
    <li> Now coconut oil helps to promote hair growth by penetrating deep into the follicles and stimulating growth. It also help promotes the general health of the scalp and helps to fight against scalp problems such as insect bites and lice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its moisturizing property makes it ideal for dry hair. Coconut oil for hair growth help stop hair thinning and stimulates new hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the price of this product.</li>
    <li> I love the way this makes my skin feel, especially here in Colorado where it is so dry. It is also great as a hair conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have purchased many of oils from this brand, as well as many of coconut oils. I must say this is not my favorite. I like it however only for a body moisturizer, granted it is a good body moisturizer. I would not use it for cooking or ingestion.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell if I really like the oil but what I don&#x27;t like is how unbelievable hard the jar is to open every time I go to us it. I don&#x27;t even close it tight and I have to have my husband open it every time for me it&#x27;s frustrating</li>
    <li> I love love LOVE this product! I almost never write on message boards or give product reviews... but since Amazon has made it so easy for me to post I&#x27;ll do it just this once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product for my body (in place of lotion) and my hair (about 30  minutes a couple time a month), and to cook with. I sauté all my vegetables in coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other brands before but I always come back to this brand - it&#x27;s the BEST!</li>
    <li> Great for hair and skin! I use this stuff all over, but it&#x27;s now my official hair conditioner. I slather my hair with it each night and wash it out (very well) in the morning. Fabulous! I&#x27;m even converting my mother and sisters over to using coconut oil. It isn&#x27;t good for a daytime facial moisturizer- you&#x27;ll look seriously shiny- but your skin will look great the morning after if you use it as a nighttime moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for sometime. Put a little over my eyebrows daily for growths. Can&#x27;t say I see a difference!</li>
    <li> The product did not have the coconut aroma, which made me skeptical if it was true coconut oil which it can be any vegetable oil.  Hot oil process bring old fashion aroma.  This product claims cold process extraction.  If you wish a no aroma product, this is for you.  Otherwise, cook one yourself from a coconut cream can.  You can be more certain.  But this is quite good for simple application.</li>
    <li> For topical treatment of exzema or even dry skin, I love this product. Natural, safe, great! Highly Recommend. Was hard to find and now I&#x27;ve found it again; I will keep it on hand always. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> so loving the product. will order some more.....................&lt;br /&gt;so happy about the product. . .  . . . .. .</li>
    <li> My hair loves this oil.  It seals the moisture in my hair so well that I don&#x27;t really need to moisturize everyday.  The texture of it changes with the temperature and that helped me to know that it was pure.  The value was great because it is much cheaper than other coconut oil that I researcher.  Overall, I am very please with my purchase and all the other products I have bought from the NOW brand (Shea butter and almond oil).  They have won me over and I will continue to buy from them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this coconut oil for many things so far. As a leave in hair conditioner,for dry skin, added baking soda to it so I could removed sticky labels from jars ( a natural DIY goop remover) .My son has eczema  &amp; I&#x27;ve been applying this coconut oil on my son to his dry skin patches after his baths &amp; his eczema has cleared up a lot and his skin is sooo soft.My oil has become liquid lately because I&#x27;ve been keeping my house too warm this winter, so I just pored some of it into one of those empty travel bottle you can buy at a dollar store,I also find it more convenient &amp; easier to use when it&#x27;s in a bottle because sometimes my jar wouldn&#x27;t open when the oil hardens around the lid. ( had to run hot running water around the lid area to melt the coconut oil before I could get the lid to budge).. I have also added this oil to my everyday skin lotion &amp; I love the results. I will buy this Coconut oil again once I run out..Love it!</li>
    <li> i bought it only bcse i been reading so many good reviews on it, i thought i try it out and see if it will work for me. im currently using it for my dry hands and i used it only once for my hair.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Love this product, I use it literally all over my body, a cleanser for my face, moisturizer for my hair and body. It make my skin very soft.</li>
    <li> coconut oil is the best stuff ever i use it for everything on myself my kids my dog and the glass jar comes in handy once your done.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to use on my hair. I was pleased with the packaging, comes in a glass jar. I expected it to smell like coconut but the product has no smell at all. Overall, it works for what I need it for and I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!! Really great for your hair and your skin! I have a very sensitive face and lotions burn my skin. But this stuff has no sent at all. Just a really great moisturizer. Or you can put it on damp hair and leave on for an hour or you can sleep in it all night. And it makes a big difference. Just beware if you don&#x27;t wash your hair out all the way it could become greasy.</li>
    <li> I bought this for stretch marks and razor burn on my legs. I have sensitive mixed African-American/Latina skin that does not respond well to harsh chemicals. I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks and the razor burn is gone and some stretch marks I had are already smoothing out. I also use it on my face when running to protect my face from the cold. It doesn&#x27;t break my out and my skin feels great.</li>
    <li> Please be aware that coconut oil starts off solid and if heat is applied to it then it will turn to liquid. I like to scoop some in my hand and hold it in my hand until it becomes liquid then I put it on my skin after a shower. I haven&#x27;t found anything more moisturizing for my hair or skin.</li>
    <li> I truly love this product I use this product on my skin and hair it use when I get out of shower very good moisture and it does not keep your skin oily after applied.  I apply on face leave on over night also good for winter use!! Just an overall good product, I would recommend this for purchase you will love it!! I need this in a bigger jar since I use this up in a month!!</li>
    <li> This is made for topical treatment, I use this all over my body and it keeps me hydrated much longer than any other treatment I have used. I adore that it doesnt make me smell like anything but me, too -- that&#x27;s the biggest plus to this product, I&#x27;d say.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for hair uses since I needed a cheaper alternative to the pure coconut oil since others were $10 and above. Its not as big as I expected but it does last a long time (less is more). Its a solid then warms into liquid form really well. Great for body and hair. But I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using this product for food purposes since it is geared to external uses (disregarding the pure factor). It is a great and cheaper alternative to the other more expensive type of coconut oil if you&#x27;d like it for external purposes and works just like them. I recommend using it as a pre-poo and post-poo, works magic!</li>
    <li> Used it for my hair and it left my hair really greasy. Could be the recipe I used or the product. Either way, I wont do it again.</li>
    <li> It does not have the traditional coconut smell which I prefer but it is smooth and silky on the skin.</li>
    <li> The product arrived melted, but I do not blame the company for that. It is indeed, as other reviewers have stated, odorless. I used it on both my skin and hair. I bought it after hearing about it&#x27;s benefits and since I have issues with dry scalp, I thought this could help. It makes your skin feel great.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product.  You can never go wrong using coconut oil.  I understand it is good for weight loss if ingested daily.  I recommend it to family and friends.</li>
    <li> Awesome coconut oil however the lid is really hard to get off! I barely tighten it and it sometimes is seriously the hardest thing ever to get off. Rather than that great product!</li>
    <li> I use this for my hair and skin. I mix it with some of my lotion and it makes my skin gorgeous! And for my hair, I literally use this as a conditioning treatment once a month, I take 1/2 cup and put it in my hair for like 3hours and saran wrap my head so the oil doesnt get everywhere. Then wash it out with shampoo and conditioner... and omg my hair is GORGEOUS!!!</li>
    <li> I needed a good moisturizer to use on my dry feet. I read about coconut oil and decided to try it. So glad I did! I rub my feet with it before bed and put on socks. In the morning my feet are soft and moisterized. It also made my toenails look clean and healthy. I started using it as a hair conditioner as well. I&#x27;m very happy with the results!</li>
    <li> Satisfied customer. Thank you</li>
    <li> I have been using coconut oil since I have become natural and I absolutely love this company and product. I loved the price for it as well because I have purchased this for more from the store.</li>
    <li> I love this oil for my hair. I use extra virgin olive oil on my kinky curly hair as well but this oil is light and  very moisturizing. I noticed a huge difference in my hair, especially after using it as a pre-poo ( letting it sit on my hair for hours). My twist outs are more defined with this stuff. I simply love it. I recommend this to everyone one.</li>
    <li> Best product I have found for my dry skin &amp; dry hair.</li>
