### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It has a wonderful odor.</li>
      <li>I have used it for year&#x27;s and have not ever found another one that smells as good as Coco Mademoiselle!!</li>
      <li>GREAT PRICE!!!!!</li>
      <li>This is an excellent fragrance.</li>
      <li>lol!</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT!!!</li>
      <li>I smelled the Coco Mademoiselle By Chanel in Sephora, absolutely loved it and decided to check the prices online and then order it.</li>
      <li>I love this parfum spray!  </li>
      <li>Buy from a reputable store in person!</li>
      <li>but to each their own.</li>
      <li>I knew it was too good to be true!</li>
      <li>I purchased this as a gift for my wife for Christmas 2009, who has worn this perfume for years, and immediately upon receiving it, she noticed that the cap came off very easily (</li>
      <li>IT&#x27;S ONE OF MY FAVORITE EAU DE PARFUM SPRAY.</li>
      <li>We immediately became even more suspicious of this bottle and contacted the seller immediately.  </li>
      <li>still every time I use this perfume, I fall in love with it</li>
      <li>My Daughter love&#x27;s this product.</li>
      <li>SO MAKE SURE THAT</li>
      <li>I know of some people who love it</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>Also, Chanel puts an authentic number on the bottle which guarantees it&#x27;s product.</li>
      <li>I TOTALLY LOVE COCO MADEMOISELLE BY CHANEL,</li>
      <li>The perfume´s tap was made of plastic instead of glass, and the liquid that was inside didn´t smell as the authentic one.  </li>
      <li>great smelling product, shipper was able to get me the product in a reasonable time</li>
      <li>My favorite scent ever.</li>
      <li>I thinks is perfect for a lady that want to make a professional statement but not for a single happy woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
      <li>I was able to compare it to the original bottle that I was almost out of.</li>
      <li>and there is no comparison because the knock off bottles tend to lose that potent smell quickly after applying the perfume and a lot of times if you look close the bottles themselves have been tampered with to refill a genuine bottle with imposter perfume</li>
      <li>a woman must be two things classy and fabulous ~ coco chanel and this scent is all that and more its musky and sexy yet girlie!</li>
      <li>The scent is light, I recommend this product</li>
      <li>I have smelled both the genuine bottle and these imposter bottles</li>
      <li>Another hint is the uneven sides of the bottle, the original have the sides perfectly alligned.  </li>
      <li>I WAS EXCITED, BUT</li>
      <li>and they charge you full price for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Immediate full refund.</li>
      <li>I returned the item and got a full refund.</li>
      <li>I received water for... the floor or something, to make the house smell good or whatever, but definitely not a perfume.</li>
      <li>INVEST in a good perfume, not this cheap imitation.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!!</li>
      <li>It was NOT the real thing!!</li>
      <li>I was expecting something fresh.</li>
      <li>its more like musty and old.</li>
      <li>I was told it did not smell right.  </li>
      <li>For the first time after buying in Amazon for years, I feel robbed.</li>
      <li>(An approach that worked pretty well a year ago with Flora from Gucci.</li>
      <li>When I received the product I could tell that the fragrance was not the same as an authentic bottle that I already had purchased from a department store.</li>
      <li>(First off, I did not buy this from this buyer, or from Amazon)  </li>
      <li>Ordered the cheap perfume (from a seller that is a bit closer to where I live so that wouldn&#x27;t incur a huge cost for shipping it back).</li>
      <li>At the first application it seems like it is the real thing, but as time passes the smell becomes unbearable.</li>
      <li>It had all the indications of a knock off of the real thing.</li>
      <li>I bought the real thing in a department store.</li>
      <li>Did not seem to be the real perfume.</li>
      <li>the fragrance is NOTHING like what the real product is.&lt;br /&gt;I have passed the product to Chanel Australia for investigation.</li>
      <li>I am 26 years old so the smell is to strong and deep for me.</li>
      <li>We immediately realized that something was done to this product that wasn&#x27;t consistent with the direct designer (Coco Chanel).  </li>
      <li>The only good thing was that they returned my money back and they apologized several times.</li>
      <li>My first impression was OLD LADY..</li>
      <li>Customer Service then told my wife to look on the inside of the sealed cap that had come off of the bottle and explained to her that she should see a particular identifying mark that Coco places on the inside of those seals that authenticates their products (which I won&#x27;t disclose for security considerations of Coco).  </li>
      <li>Bills Bling\\&quot; and I would highly advise anyone against purchasing any product from this seller.</li>
      <li>When the bottle arrived from Coco Chanel, we immediately compared it to the original suspicious bottle and found that the color of the perfumes were very different and also that the sealed cap on the bottle purchased directly from Coco Chanel</li>
      <li>This item is completely inauthentic!!</li>
      <li>Last all day and worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>The bottle and labeling were not quite right, and the product inside was definitely Not Coco Mademoiselle by Chanel!</li>
      <li>I suspect that it had been watered down with alcohol because there was a strong note of it when I sprayed it.  </li>
      <li>Online 2.5 times the volume was only few bucks more expensive than Sephora and it was nice and genuine when it arrived and</li>
      <li>I have routinely bought this product for my fiancee for the last 10 years from the big department stores (Macys, Bloomingdales) and they are always genuine products.</li>
      <li>First off, I&#x27;d like to note that Amazon handled the situation swiftly and got me my money back.  </li>
      <li>It smells a lot different than the real one!</li>
      <li>The original bottle does not have any stickers and this imitation did.</li>
      <li>and they want the department stores to give them their money back or exchange it for the real thing.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a young fruity smell.</li>
      <li>It;s frequently out of stock.  </li>
      <li>I received the product in a real Chanel box,but when I see the interior was a big surprise !!</li>
      <li>These perfumes are bogus amd Amazon should cut them out completely.</li>
      <li>I am disappointed that stuff like this exists on Amazon, as I would like to know that I could be confident about going there safely for my purchases.  </li>
      <li>Then I looked at the label on the bottle buttom and compared it with the real one which I purchased in a store and saw that the Chanel had no R near its name for Copyright.</li>
      <li>This confirmed our already high suspicions that the bottle purchased by the private third party was not only tampered with but was also not authentic.  </li>
      <li>The refund was issued promptly and we used the money to purchase the same perfume directly from Coco Chanel.  </li>
      <li>My wife then contacted Coco directly and spoke to their Customer Service Department and asked them about the deficiencies she found with the bottle and the representative asked her if she had bought it directly from Coco, an authorized Coco retailer, or a  private third party and of course, my wife stated that she bought it from a private third party seller.  </li>
      <li>She thought that this was unusual and immediately compared it to the empty bottle of the same product that she still had and noticed grave differences in the construction, leading her to believe that the bottle had been tampered with or manipulated in some way.  </li>
      <li>I have bought this perfume online with little to no success in finding a genuine bottle of this perfume.</li>
      <li>But I liked Coco Mad so much and the price spread was so wide that I decided to take the risk.</li>

<li> Money well spent</li>
<li> The cap did not fit properly.</li>
<li> The Chanel name tag on the bottle was scratched, the bottle had uneven edges, the cap plastic quality was noticeably low, and finally, the scent, although seemed close at the beginning, had that fake, cheap element of poor perfumes inside.</li>
<li> I love this parfum --- but was disappointed with it.  </li>
<li> IT WAS AN IMITATION.</li>
<li> the other bottle&#x27;s cap did with little ease.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately it is not an original perfume, as expected!</li>
<li> I read the reviews and knew that I&#x27;m taking a risk since there is high possibility that the shipped product is fake.</li>
<li> I have used this perfume for a long time and this is the first time I had ever been disappointed.</li>
<li> Money down the drain!</li>
<li> Contacted the seller in few days, expressed the concern and guess what?</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Until now I realize that this was the dumbest purchase I have made on Amazon. I feel foolish and deceived by those who sold me this Coco Mademoiselle EDP.  At the first application it seems like it is the real thing, but as time passes the smell becomes unbearable. I can not even imagine of what these fake copies are made. Another hint is the uneven sides of the bottle, the original have the sides perfectly alligned.  Hope this helps to somebody else.</li>
    <li> (First off, I did not buy this from this buyer, or from Amazon)  I bought this for my girlfriend because it was recommended by a friend, so I took a chance and bought it.  My first impression was OLD LADY..it smells awful in my opinion. I know of some people who love it but I personally do not like it. It doesn&#x27;t have a young fruity smell. its more like musty and old. but to each their own.</li>
    <li> This product is a fake! Doesn&#x27;t last AT ALL!!! Furthermore, there was no info where to send it back for a refund.  Money down the drain! HATE IT! Avoid this seller!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is fake! When I got it the perfume had clearly been used because it was down to the label. It also was dirty and scrapped up. It smells a lot different than the real one! DO NOT BUY IT</li>
    <li> My Daughter love&#x27;s this product. she wears it every chance she gets. The scent is light, I recommend this product</li>
    <li> I love this parfum --- but was disappointed with it.  Sprayed it on and in 5 minutes it was gone.  Really sorry it didn&#x27;t work out for me.</li>
    <li> This product smelled like a skunk.  I had to go through Amazon to get my money back.  I knew it was too good to be true!</li>
    <li> I received the item in a timely manner but I was not satisfied with the perfume. It had all the indications of a knock off of the real thing. The scent was slightly off, the perfume was oilier than the real thing and the bottle was uneven in shape. The cap did not fit properly. I returned the item and got a full refund. I bought the real thing in a department store. They tell me they&#x27;re getting a lot of people coming in with these fake perfumes that they bought online and they want the department stores to give them their money back or exchange it for the real thing. BEWARE!</li>
    <li> This was a very bad product from the seller.  I purchased this as a gift for my wife for Christmas 2009, who has worn this perfume for years, and immediately upon receiving it, she noticed that the cap came off very easily (the cap that is supposed to be sealed to the bottle).  She thought that this was unusual and immediately compared it to the empty bottle of the same product that she still had and noticed grave differences in the construction, leading her to believe that the bottle had been tampered with or manipulated in some way.  We immediately realized that something was done to this product that wasn&#x27;t consistent with the direct designer (Coco Chanel).  My wife then contacted Coco directly and spoke to their Customer Service Department and asked them about the deficiencies she found with the bottle and the representative asked her if she had bought it directly from Coco, an authorized Coco retailer, or a  private third party and of course, my wife stated that she bought it from a private third party seller.  Customer Service then told my wife to look on the inside of the sealed cap that had come off of the bottle and explained to her that she should see a particular identifying mark that Coco places on the inside of those seals that authenticates their products (which I won&#x27;t disclose for security considerations of Coco).  My wife did not see this identifying mark.  We immediately became even more suspicious of this bottle and contacted the seller immediately.  The seller replied within 24 hours apologizing to us and telling us that she would issue an immediate refund, however; she also told us to keep the bottle and don&#x27;t even worry about sending it back, which was rather strange.  The refund was issued promptly and we used the money to purchase the same perfume directly from Coco Chanel.  When the bottle arrived from Coco Chanel, we immediately compared it to the original suspicious bottle and found that the color of the perfumes were very different and also that the sealed cap on the bottle purchased directly from Coco Chanel did not come off like the other bottle&#x27;s cap did with little ease.  This confirmed our already high suspicions that the bottle purchased by the private third party was not only tampered with but was also not authentic.  This review is not meant to be negative to Coco Chanel, as their products are authentic, geniune, and first-class, which is why my wife has been purchasing this perfume for at least 10 years.  This review is meant to bring awareness to people to excersise caution regarding the seller who sold us this product.  The seller is \\&quot;Mr. Bills Bling\\&quot; and I would highly advise anyone against purchasing any product from this seller.</li>
    <li> First off, I&#x27;d like to note that Amazon handled the situation swiftly and got me my money back.  When I received the product I could tell that the fragrance was not the same as an authentic bottle that I already had purchased from a department store. I tested them side by side.  I suspect that it had been watered down with alcohol because there was a strong note of it when I sprayed it.  I am disappointed that stuff like this exists on Amazon, as I would like to know that I could be confident about going there safely for my purchases.  The difference was that I did get my money back and without Amazon being the buffer, I might not have.</li>
    <li> The smell lasts all day, but it is a woodsy smell that gives a headache after a while. I was expecting something fresh. It is pricey but if you like woodsy, earthy fragrances then this is for you.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately it is not an original perfume, as expected! Not even close, so don&#x27;t let them cheat and rip you off!!!</li>
    <li> I thought when I purchase it was like the one at the department stores but it wasn&#x27;t after I compared.  But it is NOT a rendition</li>
    <li> I love this parfum spray!  I have used it for year&#x27;s and have not ever found another one that smells as good as Coco Mademoiselle!! Amazon has come through again, by always finding the lowest prices, for my purchases!  Thanks Amazon!!</li>
    <li> For the first time after buying in Amazon for years, I feel robbed. And I can&#x27;t even return this item. I received water for... the floor or something, to make the house smell good or whatever, but definitely not a perfume. Do NOT buy perfumes through here. Go to Macy&#x27;s and Sephora. INVEST in a good perfume, not this cheap imitation.</li>
    <li> I have routinely bought this product for my fiancee for the last 10 years from the big department stores (Macys, Bloomingdales) and they are always genuine products. I have bought this perfume online with little to no success in finding a genuine bottle of this perfume. I have smelled both the genuine bottle and these imposter bottles and there is no comparison because the knock off bottles tend to lose that potent smell quickly after applying the perfume and a lot of times if you look close the bottles themselves have been tampered with to refill a genuine bottle with imposter perfume and they charge you full price for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take it from somebody who has been ripped off multiple times by not buying direct from the department stores that have genuine products, there are no cheap bottles of expensive perfumes! Buy from a reputable store in person!</li>
    <li> I smelled the Coco Mademoiselle By Chanel in Sephora, absolutely loved it and decided to check the prices online and then order it. (An approach that worked pretty well a year ago with Flora from Gucci. Online 2.5 times the volume was only few bucks more expensive than Sephora and it was nice and genuine when it arrived and still every time I use this perfume, I fall in love with it again!)&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, back to Coco Mademoiselle By Chanel. I read the reviews and knew that I&#x27;m taking a risk since there is high possibility that the shipped product is fake. But I liked Coco Mad so much and the price spread was so wide that I decided to take the risk. Ordered the cheap perfume (from a seller that is a bit closer to where I live so that wouldn&#x27;t incur a huge cost for shipping it back). And when it arrived, yes, it was a \\&quot;bad\\&quot; \\&quot;imitation\\&quot;. The Chanel name tag on the bottle was scratched, the bottle had uneven edges, the cap plastic quality was noticeably low, and finally, the scent, although seemed close at the beginning, had that fake, cheap element of poor perfumes inside. Having the reviews here in mind, promptly I noticed that this is not what I wanted. Contacted the seller in few days, expressed the concern and guess what? Immediate full refund. And when I asked what address should I send back the product, the seller said, don&#x27;t worry about it, just discard it! lol! Something is truly fishy here, isn&#x27;t it?!&lt;br /&gt;So bottom line, although I wouldn&#x27;t discourage you at all from buying perfumes online, for Coco Mad from Chanel be extra cautious.)</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy it people. There is alot of spam going on out there. These perfumes are bogus amd Amazon should cut them out completely.</li>
    <li> What was sent to us was a replica/fake!! It was NOT the real thing!! The bottle and labeling were not quite right, and the product inside was definitely Not Coco Mademoiselle by Chanel!</li>
    <li> great smelling product, shipper was able to get me the product in a reasonable time</li>
    <li> I received the Eau de Parfum Coco Mademoiselle by Chanel in a timely manner but as soon as I opened the box I saw that the cap of the bottle was broken. Then I sprayed a spritz on my hand and I could just smell alcohol scent and vaguely a bit of Coco. Then I looked at the label on the bottle buttom and compared it with the real one which I purchased in a store and saw that the Chanel had no R near its name for Copyright. Also all the infos were not lined up the same. The bottle shape was uneven.    Beware. This is a fake!</li>
    <li> I TOTALLY LOVE COCO MADEMOISELLE BY CHANEL, SO WHEN I SEEN THAT I WAS TO BUY IT ONLINE I WAS EXCITED, BUT I DID NOT PAY ATTENTION TO WHO WAS SELLING IT, SO WHEN I RECEIVED MY P ARFUM I REALIZED THAT  IT WAS AN IMITATION. SO MAKE SURE THAT IF YOU BUY PARFUM OR COLOGNES YOU SEE WHO IS SELLING IT, IF ITS NOT FROM A LEGIT STORE SUCH AS , MACY&#x27;S NORDSTRUM, ETC.</li>
    <li> I received the product in a not very well packaged box. When I opened it, the perfume was sealed but it was sopping through the box. On the receipt, there was no info on how to contact the company in case there was any problem with the order. What a pain in the ass this turned out to be!  I&#x27;m not happy at all. I&#x27;ll think twice between ordering ANYTHING online again :-(</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for a gift. I was told it did not smell right.  I took it to the mall to compare it and found out it was not the same as the mall, plus the bottle was different.  I will never purchase stuff like this on the internet again.</li>
    <li> I received the product in a real Chanel box,but when I see the interior was a big surprise !! The perfume´s tap was made of plastic instead of glass, and the liquid that was inside didn´t smell as the authentic one.  The only good thing was that they returned my money back and they apologized several times.</li>
    <li> I am 26 years old so the smell is to strong and deep for me. I thinks is perfect for a lady that want to make a professional statement but not for a single happy woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery</li>
    <li> My favorite scent ever. Last all day and worth every penny.  You will never be disappointd with this fragrance. Money well spent</li>
    <li> Did not seem to be the real perfume. Scent was off and didn&#x27;t last as long. I have used this perfume for a long time and this is the first time I had ever been disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is not a real version of the product. AWFUL packaging with the chanel label already coming off the bottle and the fragrance is NOTHING like what the real product is.&lt;br /&gt;I have passed the product to Chanel Australia for investigation. DISGUSTING</li>
    <li> GREAT PRICE!!!!! I LOVE IT!!! IT&#x27;S ONE OF MY FAVORITE EAU DE PARFUM SPRAY. CAN&#x27;T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THIS PROCUCT</li>
    <li> This is an excellent fragrance. It is a bit sassy and I love it. It stays on all day without the constant need to spray during the day.</li>
    <li> Very hard to get.  It;s frequently out of stock.  It has a wonderful odor. I&#x27;ve been trying to place an order for quite some time.</li>
    <li> It was not like the merchandise I buy in the department stores.  It had NO smell to it...Fran</li>
    <li> This item is completely inauthentic!! As soon I received it I could tell that the bottle was noticeably different. The original bottle does not have any stickers and this imitation did. Also, Chanel puts an authentic number on the bottle which guarantees it&#x27;s product. Aside from appearance the fragrance is noticeably different. I was able to compare it to the original bottle that I was almost out of. DO NOT order this product. You will be extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> a woman must be two things classy and fabulous ~ coco chanel and this scent is all that and more its musky and sexy yet girlie!</li>
    <li> I have a hard time finding it to re-order it, I&#x27;m almost out of it.</li>
