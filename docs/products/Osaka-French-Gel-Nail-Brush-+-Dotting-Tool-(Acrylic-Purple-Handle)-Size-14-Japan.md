      <li>Best brush ever!!!!</li>
      <li>My #1 helper to make manicures beautiful!  </li>
      <li>Great tool</li>
      <li>Although it would have been great for both to work.</li>
      <li>This brush works great.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t work as great as I hoped it would.</li>
      <li>Very nice brush.  </li>
      <li>Good quality and gets the job done.</li>
      <li>This is the most purrrfect brush ever!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Makes perfect smile line, very easy to use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also nice to have the dotting tool handy at all time</li>
      <li>I love love love this brush!  </li>
      <li>One additional comment - creating a perfect French manicure is all about the brush!</li>
      <li>Excellent product to make a good smile line on your french manicure.  </li>
      <li>but I think it&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>Definitely better than the brushes I was trying to use.</li>
      <li>The curve is perfect that I make  on my French manicure.</li>
      <li>It has a fuller, shorter sable hair than most which helps with dexterity.</li>
      <li>This tool has helped me do the perfect french manicure by myself.  </li>
      <li>The curved edge is PERFECT for creating a french tip and also cleaning up polish from the cuticle.  </li>
      <li>and I love that this brush helps me clean up.</li>
      <li>I do agree that the bristles stay together better than most allowing for a true clean line.</li>
      <li>I will just keep practicing and see if it gets better but overall good brush.</li>
      <li>I am ordering 2 more right now just in case</li>
      <li>Pretty misleading but overall a very good brush with a practical dotting tool at the end</li>
      <li>This is the first time I have been able to manage it.  </li>
      <li>but as far as making my white tips not the best.</li>
      <li>The gentle smile line of the bristles allow for a variety of cleaning and creating your own variance of the smile line on your nail.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had this brush for 2 years now (full time</li>
      <li>Using this brush I did my first french manicure and it turned out great; looked as good as when I have a french manicure done at the salon.</li>
      <li>(minimal shedding, etc.)This one, as opposed to the #6 that I also ordered (which is a bit too narrow), is the perfect size to create a perfect French tip.</li>
      <li>The bristles are the right stiffness and do not spread when you are making that smile!</li>
      <li>Works really good especially if its your first time trying to use acrylic nail kit</li>
      <li>Just dipped the brush in alcohol and it smoothly and completely removed the excess polish and created smooth lines.</li>
      <li>I found this one, not knowing if it would be the exact replica</li>
      <li>The brush tip came off the first time I used it.</li>
      <li>The bristles are stiff enough so you can really scrub off any stray polish and the shape is perfect.  </li>
      <li>I got this brush over the other one on Amazon (forgot what it is called) because this one got better reviews and the reviews mentioned that the bristles were a lot stronger and thicker for creating better white tips over the other one that mentioned the bristles were kind of flimsy.</li>
      <li>I have purchased a few of these brushes, but this one really performs the best, it contains thicker hair in brush and the hairs do not fall out as other brushes that I have purchased.</li>
      <li>but it seemed to leave brush marks easily when cleaning up my french manicure.</li>
      <li>It did the job and cleaned up the nail polish on my skin very well</li>
      <li>It came 3 days sooner than they promised and packaged very well.  </li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>I purchased this brush to do the smile lines on my French manicures.  </li>
      <li>The only problem is the dotting tool fell off right when I removed from the tubular container.</li>
      <li>It could just be because I am new at this process</li>
      <li>I was really excited to get my french gel nail brush because I wanted to start doing french manicures with my Gelish nail polish.</li>
      <li>Works very well for free-hand French manicures.</li>
      <li>Will get much use out of it for french manicures and using the gelish reinforcing step.</li>
      <li>Was used to a larger size for french and my impression after using this is that it works, very well in fact.</li>
      <li>I am a professional and have been using this brush daily</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for 2 years now (full time manicurist)and it just started falling apart. Wishful thinking, I thought my local beauty supply place would still carry it.  They don&#x27;t.  I found this one, not knowing if it would be the exact replica and thankfully it is! It came 3 days sooner than they promised and packaged very well.  I am ordering 2 more right now just in case, I don&#x27;t want it disappearing on me!  It has a fuller, shorter sable hair than most which helps with dexterity. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love love love this brush!  (Everyone at my salon does to, and they are always stealing it.  ha ha ha.)  The bristles are stiff enough so you can really scrub off any stray polish and the shape is perfect.  It&#x27;s also nice to have the dotting tool handy at all time so I don&#x27;t have to search for one.</li>
    <li> Works really good especially if its your first time trying to use acrylic nail kit</li>
    <li> some of the bristles are longer than others and too soft when wet for french manicure or cuticle clean up:(</li>
    <li> Good quality and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I received my product in about two weeks.  Very nice brush.  Will get much use out of it for french manicures and using the gelish reinforcing step.</li>
    <li> Best brush ever!!!! Makes perfect smile line, very easy to use. Will  definitely recommend it. My french manicure looks professional and it takes so little time to do it!</li>
    <li> Works very well. Met my expectations.</li>
    <li> Great product! Will order again!</li>
    <li> I have purchased a few of these brushes, but this one really performs the best, it contains thicker hair in brush and the hairs do not fall out as other brushes that I have purchased.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift and do not know yet how well it worked but I think it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> Definitely better than the brushes I was trying to use. The gentle smile line of the bristles allow for a variety of cleaning and creating your own variance of the smile line on your nail. I do agree that the bristles stay together better than most allowing for a true clean line. I also recommend dipping the brush in acetone and then blotting it on a paper towel so that your nail isn&#x27;t inundated with remover.</li>
    <li> This tool has helped me do the perfect french manicure by myself.  This is the first time I have been able to manage it.  Great tool</li>
    <li> The brush tip came off the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> Works very well for free-hand French manicures.</li>
    <li> Ordered this brush after reviewing several. This brush works great. I am a DYIer doing gel manicures. Using this brush I did my first french manicure and it turned out great; looked as good as when I have a french manicure done at the salon. Just dipped the brush in alcohol and it smoothly and completely removed the excess polish and created smooth lines.</li>
    <li> Bought it for a fellow coworker sshedoes not speak English or have a computer.  She loves it when doing French tips on hands and toes</li>
    <li> My #1 helper to make manicures beautiful!  The curved edge is PERFECT for creating a french tip and also cleaning up polish from the cuticle.  I use this frequently and the brush is yet to fail on me or deteriorate in quality.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush to do the smile lines on my French manicures.  The bristles separate, and it does a horrible job because some of the bristles stick out and it leaves an uneven line.  This brush does not work well for this at all, and I think it&#x27;s overpriced.  If this is your intended use - try a different brand.</li>
    <li> I am impressed with the quality of this  brush. I am a professional and have been using this brush daily and it is holding up well (minimal shedding, etc.)This one, as opposed to the #6 that I also ordered (which is a bit too narrow), is the perfect size to create a perfect French tip.</li>
    <li> Very solid brush. Was used to a larger size for french and my impression after using this is that it works, very well in fact. One unpleasing bit of info. Why does the &#x27;&#x27;Osaka Japan&#x27;&#x27; brush come with a made in china sticker? Pretty misleading but overall a very good brush with a practical dotting tool at the end</li>
    <li> This is the most purrrfect brush ever! The curve is perfect that I make  on my French manicure. The bristles are the right stiffness and do not spread when you are making that smile! The only problem is the dotting tool fell off right when I removed from the tubular container. However, I decided not to return because I needed the brush not the dotting tool. Although it would have been great for both to work. Also, let me add this line is the same that is used by the three nail salons I have used in my area. One additional comment - creating a perfect French manicure is all about the brush! This is the best!</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get my french gel nail brush because I wanted to start doing french manicures with my Gelish nail polish. I got this brush over the other one on Amazon (forgot what it is called) because this one got better reviews and the reviews mentioned that the bristles were a lot stronger and thicker for creating better white tips over the other one that mentioned the bristles were kind of flimsy. It didn&#x27;t work as great as I hoped it would. It could just be because I am new at this process but it seemed to leave brush marks easily when cleaning up my french manicure. It did the job and cleaned up the nail polish on my skin very well but as far as making my white tips not the best. I will just keep practicing and see if it gets better but overall good brush.</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome! I am an ammeture and I love that this brush helps me clean up. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product to make a good smile line on your french manicure.  It does not get sticky or messed up with acetone.</li>
