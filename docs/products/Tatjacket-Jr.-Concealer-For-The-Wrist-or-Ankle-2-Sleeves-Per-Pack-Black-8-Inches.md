<li> She got a new job that required her to have her arm tattoo hidden.  </li>
<li> Way to small and moves around to much</li>
<li> , I feel less conscious about people looking.  </li>
<li> Poor quality - one of them ripped after only 2 days worth of use.</li>
<li> long.</li>
<li> Also a lot cooler then wearing a long sleeve shirt under my work shirt.</li>
<li> But it&#x27;s nothing a lil wash and dry</li>
<li> Band could be a little smaller on \\&quot;muscle\\&quot; side...</li>
<li> Based on the fact that there&#x27;s not much to them &amp; they were fairly expensive, as well as my son telling me that they don&#x27;t taper much if any at the wrists (&amp; are therefore loose at that end), I can only grade it a 3.</li>
<li> BUT we could use partial sleeves or under armour to cover them.</li>
<li> I had them sent to my son, who asked for them, &amp; am under the impression that they&#x27;re partial sleeves made of some sort of fabric to conceal tattoos.</li>
<li> I work in the medical field and keeps my tat hidden !</li>
<li> Purchased for work for my arms and one is shorter than the other.</li>
<li> The biggest problem that I have is that it continues to slide down my arms.  </li>
<li> The bumper sticker is going on my car as soon as I get down posting this.</li>
<li> A little pricey is my only complaint.</li>
<li> These are lightweight, not hot, serve the purpose at work, wear them with black scrubs, I look like Nurse Wonder Woman!  </li>
<li> I chose black.</li>
<li> ( makes little sense but, whatever...)</li>
<li> So, since our AC at work always seems to be broken I opted to try this smaller sleeve cover to cover my half sleeve</li>
<li> Waste of money.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Way to small and moves around to much</li>
    <li> Had to cover a tattoo for work so I bought these. They do the job very well and don&#x27;t add any heat. My arm doesn&#x27;t sweat like it did with a cut up sock on it and it doesn&#x27;t leave pressure marks on my arm either.</li>
    <li> Purchased for work for my arms and one is shorter than the other. And have to constantly pull the short one up. But other wise good.</li>
    <li> Works great just slips off a little.</li>
    <li> I have worn these every day at work for 5 years. I occasionally toss them in with my laundry. They haven&#x27;t lost their elasticity after all these years. Great product.</li>
    <li> Its a little too small</li>
    <li> it feels airy and fits well. occasionally it slides down just a bit, and after a while the seam causes some itchiness, but overall comfortable and way easier than using ace bandages every day for work!</li>
    <li> I have three sets. I love them! They hide my forearm tattoo perfectly. ..They fit and feel great! Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Nice product. Received it super fast. Band could be a little smaller on \\&quot;muscle\\&quot; side...or apparently I could just use some weightlifting. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> My husband cannot have tattoos showing at work. These sleeves help to keep him cool, while hiding his tats.</li>
    <li> These are lightweight, not hot, serve the purpose at work, wear them with black scrubs, I look like Nurse Wonder Woman!  lol</li>
    <li> Love it. It&#x27;s better then the ones I had before. Light and comfortable.</li>
    <li> They do what they are suppose to ,&lt;br /&gt;My daughter Works in a eye doctors office ,</li>
    <li> Works very well, I use this for my half sleeve so it sits around my elbow. Most people don&#x27;t even look twice at it</li>
    <li> Works great for what I need.</li>
    <li> This tattoo cover-up is okay.  The biggest problem that I have is that it continues to slide down my arms.  I only weight 125...so large arms are not an issue in my situation. I pull these  darn things up on my arms all...day....long. I wish I know how to correct this sliding problem?</li>
    <li> Covers Tattoo from wrist to elbow, great purchase and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> She got a new job that required her to have her arm tattoo hidden.  This worked perfectly and was comfortable too.</li>
    <li> I just changed jobs. My new boss is &amp;#34;old fashioned). He doesn&#x27;t think women should have tattoos. I have a rather large tattoo going down my right forearm. The tatjacket fit my arm perfectly and covers the tattoo. I chose black. I want people to know there IS a tattoo there, but for it to be covered so the boss isn&#x27;t upset. The bumper sticker is going on my car as soon as I get down posting this.</li>
    <li> wear the sleeve at work to cover my forearm tatto works perfect</li>
    <li> Great buy, great quality! fast delivery...fits and works and wears well all day! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Poorly designed, too baggy around wrist</li>
    <li> I substitute for the school district on my days off and rhis item covers my tattoos on my forearm. Make you look more professional and presentable to staff and students.</li>
    <li> I hate having to cover my tat, but rules are rules.  I ordered the black tat jacket which looks good with the uniform,  but was concerned that it might get hot. Haven&#x27;t had any issues with that. Great product.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it sets out to do.  Covers up the tattoos on my forearms and does it very well.  The sleeve stays in place (occasionally you have to pull it up but I&#x27;m not constantly struggling to keep it in place) and you can wear it multiple days in a row without it getting gross.  I&#x27;ve also washing the sleeve several times now on normal washer and drier settings and it hasn&#x27;t lost its shape nor does it show any signs that it is deteriorating.  Need to cover up tattoos for people still stuck in 1950?  This is the product for you (plus this option was about 10 dollars cheaper than buying only 1 with an under armor logo on it)!</li>
    <li> Fantastic sleeve.  Stays in place and keeps cool. I work in the medical field and keeps my tat hidden !</li>
    <li> Great instead of long sleeve shirt</li>
    <li> Poor quality - one of them ripped after only 2 days worth of use. I should have just made my own. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Works fine for hiding my forearm tattoo!</li>
    <li> Excellent for the work that I do. Being a cop and having to cover forearm tattoos during raids or any activity that I need discretion for. They are great</li>
    <li> It does what I need it to do. A little pricey is my only complaint.</li>
    <li> A good price for a good product. Makes it easy to cover my tattoos without having to wear a full long sleeve shirt. I work in a kitchen and am hot enough as is.</li>
    <li> I needed this sleeve to cover up some work.  Great fit, I feel less conscious about people looking.  It looks like a sports band/cover. Highl recommend if you need to cover it up.</li>
    <li> they are amazing for work! no need to wear long sleeves and it perfectly covers up what i need it too</li>
    <li> Fits well and stays in place.  Lightweight and cool for all day wearing.</li>
    <li> Excellent sleeves. Perfect for work!</li>
    <li> Great covering for healing tattoos, ointments don&#x27;t mess up the sheets while you sleep</li>
    <li> Great for work because my company hates to see body art,  but over time they start to lose there shape.  But it&#x27;s nothing a lil wash and dry can&#x27;t fix.</li>
    <li> I love the idea for thus as I have a tattoo on my forearm and I am small so I have smaller arms although it seemed a bit big wish it fit a tad bit more snug so I don&#x27;t have to keep pulling it up</li>
    <li> Awesome product!!! It&#x27;s just what I needed.</li>
    <li> Great product! Light airy, great coverage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I&#x27;m being asked about &amp;#34;applying&amp;#34; these concealers. I had them sent to my son, who asked for them, &amp; am under the impression that they&#x27;re partial sleeves made of some sort of fabric to conceal tattoos. Based on the fact that there&#x27;s not much to them &amp; they were fairly expensive, as well as my son telling me that they don&#x27;t taper much if any at the wrists (&amp; are therefore loose at that end), I can only grade it a 3.</li>
    <li> Great product! Covered my tattoos and are very comfortable.  I will definately buy more so I even have extras. Also a lot cooler then wearing a long sleeve shirt under my work shirt.</li>
    <li> My husband has to cover his tattoos for work and this is fantastic. doesn&#x27;t make him hot and stays in place.</li>
    <li> Love the Tat jacket cover up sleeve! I wish I didn&#x27;t have to cover my tats, but unfortunately, I do. This product is light, breathable, comfortable. Thank you!</li>
    <li> If you workout and have massive forearms, depending on what size you get, they can rip on you.  I think I just got one size too small, but overall this tat jacket is a great coverup if you need to hide your tattoos.</li>
    <li> This product is great. I work for a hospital so it does the job and its light weight. As for the logo, it&#x27;s on the inside and you can&#x27;t see through it so don&#x27;t worry. I&#x27;m picky about those things so no complaint here. I ideally would like a tighter fit but that&#x27;s is just me. It&#x27;s not loose I just like things that are a super snug.  I reccomend this product for sure and I would buy from them again.</li>
    <li> New tattoo policy at work stating that we can no longer have visible tattoos nor can we wear long sleeved shirts to cover them with BUT we could use partial sleeves or under armour to cover them. ( makes little sense but, whatever...) So, since our AC at work always seems to be broken I opted to try this smaller sleeve cover to cover my half sleeve ( yes, it&#x27;s big enough to move to the upper arm but then again I&#x27;m a girl and I&#x27;m somewhat small.)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light weight to keep me cool enough at work, stays in place for the most part and most importantly it covers my sleeve and under arm tattoo. Can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> The title of the product said it was for the forearm. I got it be auss that&#x27;s we&#x27;re my tattoo is, and it&#x27;s for the upper arm. I hate it.</li>
    <li> Perfect for tattoo coverage at work.</li>
