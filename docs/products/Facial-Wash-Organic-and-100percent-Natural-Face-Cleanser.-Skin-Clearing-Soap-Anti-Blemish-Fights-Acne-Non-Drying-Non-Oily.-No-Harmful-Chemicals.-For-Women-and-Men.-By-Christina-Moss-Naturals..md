<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very nice face cleanser. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. No breakouts. A little goes a long way. Lathers nicely. Like that its natural and organic.</li>
    <li> I have Rosacea and this is the only cleanser that I have tried in the past 20 plus years that DOES NOT make it worse!  Thank you. Oh, and a little does go a long way....</li>
    <li> Have been using this for almost a year. It works as described. No complaints. First bought this because of the environmental concern that many facial cleaners had &amp;#34;microbeads&amp;#34; that are plastic, getting into the water supply and potentially damaging to the environment.</li>
    <li> LOVE - LOVE - LOVE this product. My face feels GREAT after using this, The natural rosemary is very refreshing, leaves my skin squeaky clean, but moisturized.  Yes, this bottle is 4 oz - (which is 1/2 cup) while that may not seem like a lot, let me tell you that I have been using this product twice a day since Mid-August and I still have over 2/3 of the bottle left. A little REALLY goes a long way.  At this price for 6 months worth of product that is Organic with 100 percent natural ingredients this is incredibly affordable. My skin is extremely sensitive and I have had no problems whatsoever while using this product.  I cannot say enough good things about this cleanser.  I also LOVE the seller - EXTREMELY good communications, organic products made in small batches by hand, earth friendly, and ethical business practices. A rare find indeed in this day and age.  Do your skin a favor and order this today!  I also use the moisturizer and the serum - these 3 products together have worked wonders on my skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now.  I love it!!</li>
    <li> Love this so much! Makes your skin feel so clean. I also have sensitive skin and this product is really calming on my skin. It also doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like most other cleansers! Even though it&#x27;s only 4 ounces, it actually last quite a while. My mother and I both use the same bottle and it still takes a long time to run out! definitely worth trying!</li>
    <li> so far I&#x27;m happy with this face wash.  It truly doesn&#x27;t have any garbage in it and I&#x27;m glad they are keeping it that way.  No chemicals and all natural.  will buy again</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way is true.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had skin issues most of my life and this product has exceeded my expectations!  Love it!</li>
    <li> My face is so happy after finding this facial wash on a whim. This company is a gem to work with- they check in on you regularly in a very kind way to make sure the product is working the way you want it to. Lovely switch from the non-organic chemical warfare I used to put on my face. My skin tends to be on the oily side with some mild adult acne...and VERY sensitive. Can&#x27;t wait to try more of their products.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash. My skin feels like is regenerating faster.</li>
    <li> Love how this is making my face feel. Cleared my breakouts and has gave my skin a pretty glow</li>
    <li> Really great product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for those days where oil cleansing is too much, or travelling as well, since its difficult to travel with a bunch of oils. This face wash is actually very surprising. The tiniest dot will lather and cleanse your entire face! It does leave your skin feeling quite clean, which is a little off putting to me, since I&#x27;m used to that oiled up feeling, but my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out at all! I seriously think this bottle will last me at least a year because it is so concentrated and the quality is fantastic! Great find!</li>
    <li> At first...I saw the tiny bottle and thought I had over paid for what I got.  Its true, a little goes a long way so I assume this bottle will last me 6 months.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This review is for the facial toner.  I like it very much!  It&#x27;s very gentle, yet effective!  This is definitely a product I will continue to use!</li>
    <li> Leaves my face feeling fresh as ever....its amazing how good you feel after using this in the morning.....</li>
    <li> Used it for the fist time today. I could feel instantly a difference in my skin. Refreshed and my skin felt clean and nourished. Will def buy again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had sensitive skin and had been searching for a natural product that didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. It&#x27;s also nut-free, which is hard to find. This product is so gentle on my skin and doesn&#x27;t make me break out. It actually seems to be clearing my acne. Only a small amount is needed. I do an oil cleansing before washing with this product, and my skin feels and looks great. I also feel better about not having to worry about toxic chemicals entering my body through my skin. Great product!!</li>
    <li> I enjoyed the product</li>
    <li> I really do like this product but the new pkg dispenses too much soap and u can&#x27;t tell when your running low. But I won&#x27;t use any other facial wash.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, and I was a bit &amp;#34;annoyed&amp;#34; at first when I was constantly contacted and &amp;#34;urged&amp;#34; by the company to write a review for their products. I mean c&#x27;mon, it&#x27;s only been only 2 weeks; even though I liked it the first time I tried it, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it did what it stated.&lt;br /&gt;But I decided to write a product review now, after finishing the first bottle and am about to buy a second one for myself and another one for sister because it&#x27;s probably the best facial wash I&#x27;ve tried. Never before have my skin looked so healthy and silky after just a facial wash, and never before have I felt completely at ease, without any dryness notice after using a facial wash product.&lt;br /&gt;I was worried at first that it does not cleanse well, but after a while, I realize that just because the facial wash is gentle and smooth doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not cleansing my face. In fact, my face is super clean and still soft and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit reluctant to purchase a moisturizer from Christina Moss Naturals because of the price, so I used this facial wash in conjunction with this moisturizer &amp;#34;Olivella All Natural Virgin Olive Oil Moisturizer From Italy (50ml) 1.69 Fluid Ounces&amp;#34; and I have never had better skin than before. Definitely check it out as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers</li>
    <li> This product is great! It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin too dry and also helps in acne breakout. I used to use a tea-tree oil based face wash but this one truly outperform all I have ever used. I find it very helpful if you use it twice daily. My only complain is, even though it requires less amount, this product is very expensive!!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Facial Wash about a month ago after hearing about it on TV.  I LOVE IT, and only wish I could have been using this product for the last 50 years.  I found that I only need to use a tiny bit each time I wash my face, so it will last a long time, and it leaves my skin feeling so nice!</li>
    <li> I am from the Caribbean and this facial wash is one of the best........i have used in years. Loved it so much, i purchased a second bottle within a week of getting mine for a friend and sent it to him in New York.</li>
    <li> I used this facial wash for about two weeks and it caused my face to be drier than normal and caused my face to break out even more. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, and this cleanser does not irritate my skin at all.  It leaves my skin shiny clean.</li>
    <li> My acne skin loves it and no more white heads or cystic acne</li>
    <li> Not invasive to my skin.  You can tell the product is made by natural resources. My skin feels clean without the harsh chemicals. I love it.</li>
    <li> This is my second pregnancy and both times my normally low maintenance skin has gone haywire! I&#x27;ll get combination skin where some spots are dry and red whereas others are clogged and oily. I&#x27;ve wasted a lot of money on pregnancy safe products and even tried plain coconut oil and nothing has worked until now. I use the face wash and moisturizer and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference. I can also feel confident that my skin is not absorbing any harmful chemicals.</li>
    <li> a little goes long way. doesnt hurt my eyes, removes my make up very well, and  my face feels clean afterwards</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I was looking for an alternative to the harsh chemical facial cleansers that I had used for years and now I have finally found it.  My face is much softer and most blemishes are now gone!</li>
    <li> This is the best cleanser!  I&#x27;m thrilled that I found this, it does the job great!  Follow up with moisturizer right away to prevent drying.  I also love the organic moisturizer from Christina Moss, using both of her products have 85% cleared my problem skin and it&#x27;s been 3 weeks.  I&#x27;ve been trying to win this battle with adult acne for five years!!</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive and dry, and it is prone to breaking out, especially when it is irritated.  I have tried dozens of different facial cleansers sold in stores and on Amazon.  While the reviews of this product were great, I thought the ingredients in the product sounded very promising, which is why I wanted to try it even though it was a somewhat expensive product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small bottle will last you an extremely long time because you only need to use a very small amount, and the product lathers up very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the product for about three weeks.  The more I used the product the more my skin began to feel dried out.  Around the third day, my skin started to look and stay red because it was so dried out.  Not long after that I began getting more acne, and these breakouts were in areas of my skin that were completely clear and would rarely ever breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the skin redness and increased acne was something I have been able to put up with most of my adult life, I decided that making the problem worse by continuing to use this cleanser was not a good idea.  At no point of using this product did I see any improvement in my skin or pore shrinkage/clearing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the product is very subtle, and it was barely noticeable.  I did notice that when I would wake up in the morning that my eyes would be very dry and almost stinging, which I did not have before using the product and did not have after discontinuing the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the 3+ weeks of using this product, I switched back to using [[ASIN:B003YMJJSK CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser, 12 Ounce]].  While the CeraVe product has some questionable ingredients as far as safety, it does not cause my face to dry out and become irritated.  I will say that you need to be very careful on how you use the CeraVe cleanser because it can also dry out your skin if you over-wash or use too much of the soap (you only need a very small drop in order to make agood lather and wash your face).  About a week after returning to the CeraVe cleanser, my skin redness decreased significantly, and the breakouts began to clear up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your skin is not dried out and irritated, I also recommend using baking soda (as a gentle scrub paste (it is just water and baking soda)) one to three times per week in order to exfoliate your skin (don&#x27;t overdo it on sensitive areas).  The exfoliation is what helps with clearing out pores and removing dead skin, but it takes some time to learn how your skin will react to it, how often you should do it, and how aggressive you can be with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the Christina Moss facial cleanser has organic/natural ingredients, it was just too stripping for my skin.  Your skin needs its natural oils in order to protect itself, and if it is always dried out you will be susceptible having skin problems.  This product might be worth trying out if you have very oily skin, but I would not recommend it if you have very dry or very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love using this and have seen improvement in my skin.  My friend who works construction used it one day when his face was red from chemicals and a face mask rubbing.  It helped him so much I bought him a bottle for Christmas and he uses it everyday!</li>
    <li> I love Christina Moss Naturals after I ordered her shampoo and conditioner. I thought I would give the face wash a go. I did not apply it on a sponge or a brush as suggested. I used about a dime size amount on my finger tips in the shower. It lathered well and did not leave my skin feeling dry afterwards. The fragrance was nice and light. I loved it. I will try to get a facial brush to apply it next time.</li>
    <li> I find this to be a great product. The only reason that I&#x27;m giving it only 4 stars is because it dose slightly dry my face out. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple days now and I&#x27;m noticing a big difference besides the fact that it dries the skin. I break out pretty bad on my forhead and those are nearly gone. My boyfriend even committed on the clarity of my skin. I am very happy with this product. A very little goes a long way</li>
    <li> Gentle, but cleans well. Smells wonderful and just need to use a small amount. I love it!</li>
    <li> The face wash is OK.  I do not like the facial cream.  I need to return.  I did not like the fragrance, I did not like how it absorbs into the skin.  It states organic but there is NO certification noted anywhere.</li>
    <li> I started to use it 1 year after I gave birth to my 2nd son. Had been on Cetaphil for quite a long time, thought it was natural and good. Totally wrong there. The ingredient list tells all. Anyways, my skin was becoming very sensitive and dry. Not to mention the big pores that I didn&#x27;t even dare to look at. Really wanted to try some natural stuff thus I got to know this. My skin felt a little dry after the first a couple of uses. Hence I just stopped it. Then I was contacted by the seller for any thoughts after use. I honestly told him what happened and he, not knowing what I had gone through, immediately got what I might have used before and told me it was the common syndrome after using Cetaphil for a while. Things would be much better after a few more uses. He has also kindly offered full refund in case I still didn&#x27;t like it after more trials. I decided to give it a try and now my skin is much better. I also tried everything I can to improve my skin. But this cleanser just makes my face feel great after wash, not dry but clean enough. I take it everywhere I go. Very grateful.</li>
    <li> Comments from Doreen Firman:  I bought this on a special offer along with the facial moisturizer and face toner.  These two products I have been using and love it!  The facial wash is a new product which I hadn&#x27;t try before.  It&#x27;s been a week using the facial wash.  I love the feeling my face gives me a refreshing feel to it.  All three facial products are excellent!!  Also, I am very impressed with the customer service I received from the company.  They are truly great customer service oriented!!  Thank you Mr. Davies!</li>
    <li> Been using this product for a couple weeks now....love it!!!  I like the idea that there are no chemicals like the cleansers we have used in the past!  I will be buying one for my husbands very sensitive skin and will also try the moisturizing cream!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this facial wash. I also use Christina Moss Naturals facial moisturizer and my skin seems very happy. I am extremely conscious about the products I put on my body and I was so happy to discover this line of products--highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually use this to remove my waterproof foundation at night. I don&#x27;t own makeup removers anymore, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> My wife uses the facial wash and she is very satisfied with it and exceeds her expectations! she loves it very much</li>
    <li> This face wash make me break up more</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely manner. Works better than I had expected. When you have hormonal acne and you&#x27;re in your late 20&#x27;s, you get pretty desperate for something, ANYTHING, that will make even a slight difference. To give you something to go on, as I said, I&#x27;m a 28 year old female. I have very dry skin. Everything I&#x27;ve used prior to this dried my skin out beyond belief -- 100% natural &amp; organic or not. This still leaves my skin slightly dry sometimes, but nothing compared to the degree of other products, and at no fault of the product itself. My skin is just always going to be dry no matter what. My skin feels so clean and nice afterwards. I will be using this product for as long as it&#x27;s available. It should be noted that I use this product when I wake up and at night right before bed. One to two times a week I wash my face with this, then use a simple brown sugar, honey and olive oil (or whatever oil I feel like using at the time. Rosehip seed oil, apricot oil, coconut oil, etc.) scrub, then I use the Aztec Secret Indian Healing clay mask. I make my own skin balm that has a lot of healing and antibacterial benifits. I would use the Christina Moss moisturizer if I had the funds, but I don&#x27;t. I would still highly suggest it though since it contains almost all of the oils I use in my skin balm. I hope someone finds this review helpful. At least give it a try. And don&#x27;t expect a miracle out of any product. All acne issues stem from some kind of internal issue(s). So if you aren&#x27;t willing to get the inside right along with the outside, you will never find something that helps. Good luck to you!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Will certainly be ordering other thing from this line. I&#x27;m one happy cuastomer!</li>
    <li> I like how it takes so little to cleanse my face and it has a very nice scent. I&#x27;m glad to find something that is organic.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this stuff is amazing! I have spent A LOT of money on countless products that did not work. This product is well worth the price and quality!</li>
    <li> Wonderful. You only need a very small amount and it leaves my face squeaky clean! (Literally squeaky!). I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in the reduction of acne, but I don&#x27;t use great quality makeup as of right now. I follow with their moisturizer, and I love the combination together. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I enjoy this wash a lot. I have purchased twice already.</li>
    <li> At first I pondered on if I would order this product because of the price but I finally took the plunge and let me say I have never had such an amazing facial cleanser! My face is never oily or dry after cleaning, I use it in the morning and before bed at night. My P.C.O.S breakouts have almost completely disappeared and it is so concentrated that such a small bottle really lasts a long time! I can not imagine using any other cleaner on my face now.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way! I&#x27;ve had a very hard time finding a natural cleanser, nonetheless organic, that lathers and cleans so well! My face does not feel dry or oily after. I love this product. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work for me, causing breakouts. But the return was speedy and hassle-free. Sounds like it works for others.</li>
    <li> This product is great.  I&#x27;ve recently switched over to using all organic/natural products for my skin and I have to say this is just as good as the pricey facial wash I used to use.  A little goes a very long way.  I&#x27;m very happy I made the switch.  This also works well with the clarisonic cleaner - foams up well when I used the clarisonic with this but even using a dime size amount by hand is more than enough.</li>
    <li> Contains Rosemary extract and essential oil which is unfortunately very allergenic to me. I wanted to like it, but the redness and itching was too intense after the first facial wash.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using a facial wash.  I love it and will continue.  KA</li>
    <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t  dry out my skin.</li>
    <li> Love, love it. A little definitely goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Great face wash. My skin is super sensitive, it reacts to everything and it did not react to this product. I&#x27;m a celiac and have lots of food sensitivities and usually get a rash on my face from normal face wash. I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Overrated product to be honest it isn&#x27;t that great, at first considering it costs much more then competition for what you get, in my opinion overpriced and overhyped.</li>
    <li> Only have to use a little to get the job done. Like that is made of all natural products. Makes my skin a little dry.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try something that was organic and not as expensive as my Veda products. Really love how it gets your makeup off and your skin feels clean. No need for a goner.</li>
    <li> A very small amount of this facial wash is necessary to cleanse my face.  I have sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t like a lot of products.  This works great and I am very happy with it.  I will definitely be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> I received this product at a discount in exchange for providing an honest review. Right off, I will say I dislike a face wash that doesn&#x27;t come on a pad or cloth that I can rub on and walk away. I&#x27;m WAY too busy to keep up with &#x27;real&#x27; face wash. That being said, I went all in on this one since it got such good reviews. I purchased a face scrubber to go with my new wash and just tried it out! The smell is great. It&#x27;s not overwhelmingly floral or anything, nor does it smell like I just poured chemicals all over my face. So that is a HUGE plus for me. Initially I did as the package directed and got my face damp with warm water and only used a small amount of the wash. It didn&#x27;t foam up as I had expected it to, so I added a little more water to the brush and it foamed up nicely right away-so I think that was user error on my part. I then rinsed and patted my face dry. The end result is my face is VERY soft to the touch, which I love, but also feels a little dry when I smile, etc. at the same time.-Not terribly, but a little, which is the reason for my 4 star instead of 5. I think I would for sure invest in the moisturizer with the wash next time for a top notch result. I do like it enough to try it again and buy accompanying products for the moisture aspect. Overall it&#x27;s a really nice product!</li>
    <li> I am really loving this face wash so far!</li>
    <li> I have to say that my daughters absolutely love this face wash. They are both very much into anything organic and clean. This facial wash works excellent. It has what to me is a mild eucalyptus scent. Very pleasing scent and a great face wash. The actual bottle is very well designed as well as the label. You can tell that a lot if thought went into this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review of the product. The opinions of the product are based on my experience with and use of the product.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance and texture.  Love the bit of mint in it, makes my face feel refresh and clean after washing.  I will definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> this face wash is amazing! i&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and will continue to do so. best face wash thus far!!</li>
    <li> Been trying to find an organic, clean, simple face wash for a while now &amp; I&#x27;m so relived to say I&#x27;ve finally found the perfect one. I&#x27;ve always had very sensitive, acne prone skin &amp; this cleanser works like magic.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way and I feel it does a nice job of cleaning my face without drying out my skin.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! I love how it is so concentrated. I only have to put a little on and it covers my entire face. I think this will last me for a while. And my skin feels really smooth after. I am a guy and my friends have commented that my face looks shiny. I would highly recommend this. Also I don&#x27;t have acne any more. I think I may try their moisterizer too</li>
    <li> Clean and refreshing face wash.  It will remove all oils and dirt.  It is rather drying so make sure that you apply a moisturizer when you are done washing.</li>
    <li> After loving the facial cream I thought I would give the wash a try.  Love it too!  It has a wonderful fresh scent and actually has a lather to it unlike many washes.  Very little goes a long way so it lasts a long time.  Leaves my skin clean without drying it out.  Love this line of facial products!</li>
    <li> This is amazing face wash! I use it with my clarisonic and my skin no longer seems unbalanced and acne is minimized!</li>
    <li> Great product! A little more pricey than what I usually spend on face wash, but its definitely one of those things &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;. The quality is so good that you only have to use a little bit. So, cost wise it ends up probably being the same price as cheap face washes from the grocery store. I also liked the earthy, kind of musky, smell.</li>
    <li> Small bottle big price, the scent is mild. My face and beard seems to like it, but it also like Johnson&#x27;s Baby Shampoo...</li>
    <li> Love it! Highly recommend this product, cleansing but not drying.</li>
    <li> Sorry this may be good for others ,but this caused a rash on my face.</li>
    <li> I developed peri-oral dermatitis unexpectedly last year and needed to find paraben-free facial products. This is the first face wash I tried and it&#x27;s great! My face was able to clear up and has stayed that way; I purchased a new bottle when my first ran out and have been very happy. You don&#x27;t have to use very much at all so the bottle lasts a good while and I agree with other reviewers that it doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling dry.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this face wash. Do not be discouraged by the size of the bottle- a little bit goes a long way. I have never suffered from acne, but I was looking for a face wash to take the dirt off without feeling like all of my natural oils are stripped off and this product does just that. I have also tried other natural face washes that felt like it wasn&#x27;t taking the dirt off enough. After using this product for a little longer than a month,  my skin is a lot softer and looks even (and my blackheads are gone). I no longer have a need for foundation during the day. Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed because the bottle was tiny!!!!  TINY.  I sent it back immediately.  It was like a travel size container for $30.  What was I going to do with that?</li>
    <li> Love this face wash! I can never find anything that cleans my skin without over drying... I&#x27;ve had no problem with this, my skin looks the best it has, and I&#x27;m not stuck in this dry/broken out cycle.</li>
    <li> This facial wash is great, my face is so smooth and you only need a couple of drops for a sudsy face wash, will order again.</li>
    <li> Very Happy with all their products...been using them for almost a year. The wash is very concentrated, so don&#x27;t be put off by the small bottle. All one needs is a tiny tiny amount to wash your face. We don&#x27;t need a big bottle full of chemicals to fool us!!!! And CM Naturals uses minimal packaging. Last of all their customer service is excellent.</li>
    <li> Very gentle, fragrance-free face wash for those with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Thank you thank you....I finally found a face wash that is working great on my face. I was shopping around looking for an organic face wash...tried a few of them but It wasn&#x27;t working on my mild acne. I found your product and it&#x27;s working amazing on my face. I love it so much I ordered my nephew and sister one too!!! Also ordered the moisturizer...love it!!!!</li>
    <li> My skin is super dry,after I use it my skin feels  fresh and not that dry. I love it!</li>
    <li> Love Christina Moss Naturals, products are gentle.</li>
    <li> I really like the facial wash. I was looking for something that has natural ingredients and no chemicals. I use it in the morning and at night. It does not leave my face feeling tight like another cleanser I was using. It does have a nice scent that is not too strong. You only need to a very tiny bit to put all over the face so the small bottle it comes in will last for a while. It was shipped quickly and I received it quickly. Thanks for a great product. I do like the new container the facial wash is in now. It gives a nice, new look. But it is a little more expensive than when I last bought it.</li>
    <li> My skin was dry and flaking.  My makeup just made it look worse.  After using the facial wash and moisturizer for just one week I noticed a huge improvement.  Now my face doesn&#x27;t flake and my makeup looks smooth.  This is a wonderful  product.</li>
    <li> Maybe should use more days</li>
    <li> This face wash is amazing! The scent is very light and fresh not overpowering. It removes makeup easily, didn&#x27;t cause any redness or breakouts and you only have to use a tiny amount. Yes, the bottle is small but if you only use a little it will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;This is my 3rd CM product purchase and I have been extremely impressed with everything. I recommend giving them a try.</li>
    <li> Left my skin dry but wonderful customer service. It might work for your skin so it&#x27;s worth giving it a try!</li>
    <li> This face wash is a delight to use. It takes very little to get a gentle, rich lather and it rinses off quickly.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry sensitive skin and have had nothing but wonderful results with this products.  Smells great too.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. The bottle is small so I was not sure if I he made a good purchase at first but after using it I am very happy with it and will continue to use it. It smells amazing and my very sensitive skin is looking clear and healthy after using it for about a month. And I really only use a drop each time. I think it will last me a while. Thanks for this high quality face wash at an affordable price!</li>
    <li> I just purchased my 2nd bottle!  I wish this facial wash came in a gallon jug so I could use it from head to toe!!  I&#x27;m so tired of all the chemicals that either burn my face or completely dry it out.  The concentrated feel, the scent and the lather is just pure heaven.  Seriously give this a try, you&#x27;ll never go back to another cosmetic counter!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this facial wash! The first facial wash that does not irratate my sensitive skin. I definitely recommend this facial wash to anyone with sensitive skin. Will buy again. Don&#x27;t worry about bottle size, a small amount goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Works great.  An excellent product that leaves your face feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
    <li> It smells fresh, but did little to improve or spice up my skin regiment in the mornings and night.  Take it or leave it, really.  At least the ingredients are natural and organic.</li>
    <li> Gave me the worst acne I&#x27;ve ever had in my life, so much so that I had to go on anti-biotics. I changed nothing other than my cleanser, and could not stop breaking out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice; yet my face turns red.  Therefore, I don&#x27;t know if I shall keep it.</li>
    <li> Awesome! I love how it feels on my skin. It&#x27;s gentle and very refreshing.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this face wash. It has greatly cleared up my skin. I&#x27;ve been using Murad for 2-3 years and keep having white heads and cystic acne. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks, taking skin vitamins and my skin looks much better. No more redness and I&#x27;m down to 1 little cyst. It feels amazing. Less black and white heads too!!! Thank you!!! This product is great. I started using in conjunction with Japanese Camellia Oil for a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> It is a quality product, but I suffer from very dry skin, and found it to be a little irritating.</li>
    <li> Used along with my Clarisonic, my face has never felt better or clearer! Natural is the way to go folks--don&#x27;t buy that junk off the grocery store shelves!</li>
    <li> Love this face wash &amp; the way it cleanses my face, my skin dosen&#x27;t feel dry and it allows my moisturizer to glide on. A small amount lathers my entire face &amp; neck!</li>
    <li> Great face wash.  It took me a week or so get used to it, during which time I was experiencing a little dryness.  I have since adapted and love it.  You don&#x27;t need to use a lot so this small bottle lasts a long time.  My husband is using it too and loves it.  Keeps my face clear and it smells nice too.</li>
    <li> I really love the feeling I get after washing my face with Christina Moss Naturals facial wash!  It feels so very clean!  Love that is is all natural ingredients, which is why I purchased it in the first place.  Time will tell if it helps me with my adult acne.  So far, I think it has helped a little bit.  But, I think I need a bit more time.  But either way, I will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> I really like this product because it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. I have oily, acne prone skin and this facial wash leaves my skin feeling fresh without being stripped of natural moisture. I highly recommend it! I must say that it has reduced the appearance of acne, not 100% but it&#x27;s an improvement.</li>
    <li> I just started using it. I like it so far.</li>
    <li> If you have allergies, this is not the product for you.  I immediately became congested, sneezed and then could not breathe!</li>
    <li> Great facial wash. Natural ingredients and so far seems to be effective. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for six months or so.  I really like it.  Small bottle but just a drop or two creates enough lather for my face and neck.  It&#x27;s consistent, hasn&#x27;t thinned or clogged.  Smells good.  Rinses off easily.  No cloth necessary.  I have dry skin but after washing my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry or tight, just clean.  I just ordered the moisturizer.  I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
    <li> I ordered this face wash about a month ago and have been using it every day since. I did notice it diminished the look of my pores and black heads within a few weeks. I also have sensitive skin so it was a relief to not have to worry about my face breaking out (just don&#x27;t rub too hard). The smell isn&#x27;t the most appealing but I have no sensitivity to that sort of thing anyway (I can deal and it does go away soon after use). Also, at first I used only a little because I wanted to make it last longer but the only way to get a good clean is to use about a quarter-size amount or larger. Easy to rinse off as well. I will consider re-buying unless I feel like trying something new like I did with this one. :)</li>
    <li> Expensive for face wash? Yes. Worth it? With out a doubt. I just got this product 5 days ago but I can already tell a difference in my skin. I also purchased the Christina Moss Moisturizer and the Peak Vitamin C Serum With Hyaluronic Acid. These three products together have done wonders so far. I have gluten and soy allergies (and sensitive to chemicals). Every time I try to use face wash that I buy from the store (even whole foods) my skin just looks terrible. I do better without using face products. I am 28 but have brown spots  (I don&#x27;t know if they are from my thyroid issues or sun exposure?) and fine lines and I can already see an improvement on both. My skin just looks brighter and healthier. I also like the way it suds up and feels on my face. It is true, you just need a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will also be buying the toner. Hopefully, everything keeps going great with it.</li>
    <li> Love this facial wash.  A little goes a long way and my face feel great.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even remember how I came across Christina Moss Naturals facial wash and moisturizer, but I&#x27;m so happy I did.  The wash cleanses everything gently and knowing it&#x27;s natural makes me happy.  It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found, and I&#x27;m going to stop the quest for the perfect wash &amp; moisturizer.  I have finally found them both.</li>
    <li> best product I have tried yet. I am changing for the better as far as for myself and for animals, so I wanted something that fit both areas. I have sensitive skin and this product is perfect!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few weeks but I really like it.  My face doesn&#x27;t feel dried out and it smells great!</li>
    <li> I love this facial wash. My skin feels and looks great.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with acne all my adult life. I have used so many products, I decided to try an organic face wash. So far, so good. It cleans well and afterwards your face will feel softer, not dried out. I use with my clairsonic brush.</li>
    <li> Great product had it for a while now, lasts long, fresh feeling</li>
    <li> Works well and doesn&#x27;t dry my face</li>
    <li> I got this for a friend with sensitive skin. She has nothing but praise for this product and highly recommended it.</li>
    <li> Very gentle and smells nice (although not a fan of the continuous emails from the company until you post a review...) Overall, I&#x27;d recommend</li>
    <li> Best face wash I have ever used!</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this more than 5 stars! My skin is very sensitive, acne prone, oily and mildly eczematic - and I just turned 50! I no longer need a monthly facial after using this. Leaves skin so  very soft and clean. Whatever they use in here is really a magic formula. But I know it&#x27;s all natural and good for you! This little bottle has solved all my facial problems.  A little goes a long, long, long way too. I use it with my Clarisonic Mia facial cleaning brush and it&#x27;s the perfect thing to use with it. I definitely would recommend to everyone I know. Buy it!</li>
    <li> I loved this product till my Doctor told me not to use it because off all the oils in it for my acne. I was only able to use it 3 times but loved it when I used it. I was so disappointed my Doctor told me not to use it. It seems extremely natural and I would recommend this product but would double check with your Doctor first if you have acne.</li>
    <li> the face wash is gentle and leaves my skin feeling smooth and really nice!!</li>
    <li> Best face wash. I have very sensitive skin and this is the only face wash I will use from now on.</li>
    <li> This facial wash leaves my face feeling soft, yet squeaky clean at the same time. It only takes a little bit to clean your entire face. It spreads easily and creates a light foam after application. It has a lovely aromatic scent, with a hint of menthol.  I feel refreshed and awake after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product for a low promotional price in exchange for a review.</li>
    <li> My favorite face wash. 1 bottle lasts me six months! I have terrible, sensitive, acne-prone skin and typically have only been able to use cetaphil. My skin glows with this and I appreciate its natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> Nice and gentle but it&#x27;s drying</li>
    <li> Excellent product as well as superb customer service.  Very very happy with my purchase and will continue to use it in my skin care regimen</li>
    <li> Like holy water in a bottle....the bottle itself is small but it will last you a long time. Its very consentrated so you only need about a dime sized amount on your face. It doesnt strip my fave of moisture or anything and it is gentle. Im enjoying this product so far. Other cleansers usually dry my skin out and use up quickly.</li>
    <li> Husband says this doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> The only reason I&#x27;ve given this product a 4 star rating is because this was only my second purchase. So far, I can honestly say, it&#x27;s been a fantastic product. Non drying to my problematic complexion, and yet, my skin feels very clean and vibrant. I use this product twice daily. I am still waiting for a few more times that I order to give this product a fair rating, which very well could be 5-star!&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very clean and invigorating at the same time. So far, I do love it.</li>
    <li> This face wash smells wonderful and feels wonderful on the skin.</li>
    <li> Clearing upp my ance! :))</li>
    <li> Product is nice and clean and gentle. My skin feels nice after using it, doesn&#x27;t feel dry at all afterwards. I would only recommend another choice of maybe rose or jasmine (flowery) smelling. Nothing strong, just slight because I don&#x27;t prefer the Eucalyptus or tee tree smell. I know it&#x27;s clean but it&#x27;s kind of anti-septical smelling. Just my own personal preference on scent is all. The product is great tho. :) Thanks!</li>
    <li> Love this product!!  At first my skin broke out a little as I had only used Philosophy products for years, and breaking out was something my skin had never ever done even when I was a teenager. I attributed it to the change and kept with it.  Two weeks now and I LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!  My skin feels fantastic.  I know you only need a small amnt but I do wish it came in a larger bottle.  Definitely will be sticking with this product.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Last a good amount of time, good ingredients, and beyond effective... Highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> Because you only need a little for each use, it is lasting quite a long time.  Great buy and works well too.  Does leave your skin a little dry but, is as expected.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash. It actually cleans your skin without any residue left behind but also without the drying out effects that other face washes usually have.&lt;br /&gt;I love that its all natural, like for real ALL NATURAL! It&#x27;s a good feeling to know with certainty that I&#x27;m not putting chemicals into my skin.</li>
    <li> This is a nice facial wash, but I feel as though I have to use more than others suggest in order to have a creamy lather.  What I can&#x27;t get over is the horrible smell!  With all the lovely organic essential oils on the market you would think they could have tried a little harder to make it a nicer experience for the senses.  A body or hair care product has got to smell wonderful for me to want to use it.  I may add some lavender oil to this wash, but I still question the value. I&#x27;ll see just how long it lasts me and decide then.  For heaven&#x27;s sake Christinsa Moss make smell good!!!</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical at first but it&#x27;s the best face wash I&#x27;ve ever used. It makes my face feel so soft and clean and even smells really good! Also I haven&#x27;t had a single pimple since I&#x27;ve started using it</li>
    <li> Love it. Does not strip your face which I hate!!</li>
    <li> Made my face feel clean, somewhat. But it did nothing for my acne nor blackheads. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, I&#x27;m aware of that. Personally, it didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
    <li> To start off, I&#x27;ll just say that my skin type is- very dry/dehydrated, acne-prone, and sensitive. I&#x27;ve used drugstore face washes my entire life and always leaned toward ones that were labeled as &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;noncomedogenic&amp;#34;. None of them ever really stood out or wowed me though. THIS face wash wowed me. I decided to purchase it after reading all the good reviews and seeing how simple the ingredients in it were.. and I&#x27;m really glad I did. While it may seem pricey for a face wash, just keep in mind that it is all natural and is a concentrated formula so you literally only need to use a pea sized amount to wash your entire face and neck. Every time I use it it leaves my skin feeling really soft and clean.. and more importantly, it doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling tight, which is new to me! It hasn&#x27;t broken me out at all..  if anything it seems to calm my skin a bit. I&#x27;m just a big fan of this face wash and would highly recommend it to all skin types. Yes, even acne-prone and dry/sensitive skin types! The only downfall I&#x27;ve found is that it doesn&#x27;t remove makeup well. For me that&#x27;s no big deal though.. I use an eye makeup remover and face wipe before washing my face anyway.</li>
    <li> Great skin feel afterwards. I see improvements in my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this. It&#x27;s organic so there are no irritants. This doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry out. It smells nice too.</li>
    <li> Only a small amount is needed. My face feels clean and refreshed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s silky light and doesn&#x27;t make my face feel tight. I&#x27;ve been using Aveda products for years and now I&#x27;ve switched - because I want truly all natural skin care. My skin is soft, it feels clean!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this face wash. I like knowing I&#x27;m not putting chemicals on my face, and it has helped my acne slightly. I don&#x27;t use it as regularly as I should, but I have noticed a difference in that I don&#x27;t break out nearly as much, and it is smaller when I do break out.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t stress how much  I recommend ALL of Christina Moss products! If you&#x27;re hesitant because of the price DON&#x27;T BE...It&#x27;s so worth it. With their face wash, moisturizer, and toner combined I&#x27;m not only acne free but my skin is healthy happy and vibrant!  I couldn&#x27;t be any happier with their products or their customer service! Kenny rock&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> Simply love these products!  Recommend them to everyone.  My skin has come back to normal, dryness has gone away, and feels good.  This and the moisturizer are simply the best!</li>
    <li> This stuff is excellent with the clarisonic and it&#x27;s very gentle. I think it&#x27;s the only face-wash I&#x27;ve ever used daily that doesn&#x27;t make my skin peel. Recommend it to anyone looking for a great face-wash with organic/natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is so gentle yet so effective! I&#x27;m an ingredient snob, and these ingredients are A1 plus they help keep my oil/acne prone skin under control. I use this twice daily and follow it up with the toner &amp; moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to check the ingredients, but it smells, feels natural and cleansed my face very well better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried. Placing another order just wish the price was a little bit more reasonable.</li>
    <li> Happy!!! I&#x27;ve used a major label&#x27;s Naturals line face wash for about a year now but never really loved it.  It didn&#x27;t do a great job with removing my makeup and my skin didn&#x27;t feel great; kind of dried out.&lt;br /&gt;So my expectations for this weren&#x27;t too high based on that experience.  Great News! This stuff is fantastic!!!  I will loyally use this &amp; the moisturizer from now on!</li>
    <li> I love this wash.  I have combination skin, also getting a little older and this product is awesome.  First off, it smells great.  But lots of things smell great, but contain too many chemicals.  I&#x27;ve started getting more into botanicals and essential oils and love that this product uses those in its formula.  I like that I can understand what the ingredients of this product are. It also works fantastic, it doesn&#x27;t dry out the dry areas of my skin or make the oily areas oilier. It is a nice balance.  My skin feels refreshed, clean and not dry or tight.  It lathers well and as stated, a little bit is all you need to really cleanse your face.  It works well for removing my makeup at night.  I&#x27;m glad I had the chance to try this product out in exhange for my review.  It is definitely one I&#x27;ll reorder.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash! It cleanses my face so well, removes all my make up and my face doesn&#x27;t feel dry at all! I recommend this product :-D</li>
    <li> Facial wash cleanses my skin without it leaving my skin feeling tight. I have VERY sensitive skin. I also use the moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I honestly do not know what I did before Moss Naturals products. My skin just LOVES this wash and the moisturizing cream. It really helps with dryness and keep the balance for someone who has combination skin like me. It&#x27;s awesome, money well spent. Don&#x27;t be turned off by the small size, you really need just a pea sized drop to wash your entire face and neck. Takes off make up well too.</li>
    <li> Works awesome!! I use it to wash off my makeup and it works really good. I use Sea Breeze Astringent the Original formula afterwards to get all of the remaining dirt if there&#x27;s any left, which most of the time there isn&#x27;t. I also love that it is all natural!! Will definitely keep using!</li>
    <li> This dried my face out more than it was dry before using it.  Had to give up after only 2 days of trying it.  Very disappointed as it said it was very good for dry skin.  Now I have 2 bottles.  Oh well, maybe the kid can use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Was advised by company to keep using product and delighted to say, it has worked very well, the more I use.  So thankful to receive such great Customer Service.  This Company Cares and there is not many that do what they do.  Above and beyond to make you happy!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much!!</li>
    <li> Thought this was a bit expensive for the size of the bottle but as others mentioned, a little goes a long way. You really don&#x27;t need much.  I have been using for about 2 weeks and my skin feels better.  It does not leave my skin feeling dry. I have normal to oily skin and works great for me. I really like the fact that its organic. I would recommend this product.  I will most likely purchase again when I am out.  Its worth the money.</li>
    <li> I used it for about a week. It dried my skin terribly and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with dry skin! Still dealing with the flaking. Not a product for me!</li>
    <li> Love this facial wash.  Skin feels clean after use. No funny smells.  I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I am quite pleased with this facial cleanser!  I have to use a very small amount each time I wash, and it has helped prevent acne from reoccurring on my face due to the grease/oil/chemicals that other cleaners left...Halleluiah!!!  I highly recommend giving this natural product a try!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used high end products and other natural or organic facial cleansers but nothing worked as great as this product! I have adult acne and rosacea, very sensitive, combination skin that is dry in winter and oilier in the summer. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and have noticed a huge improvement in getting rid of my acne and making my skin look healthier. I would definitely buy again and the moisturizer is perfect, too!</li>
    <li> It is gentle and effective.</li>
    <li> 1 month of using this facial wash and my skin looks fabulous, and I have bad skin.  I will see what other products they produce, because my skin really likes this one. It smells heavenly and the tips they email be really work.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first when I started trying this face wash. It contains a lot of oils and I was worried it would make my face breakout. It worked very well and my face always felt fresh! You do not need to use very much so the bottle lasted a long time! The only reason I have not bought more is that I decided to make my own face wash and see how it works out for me.</li>
    <li> I love it!Smells great. Feels great on your skin and skin feels great after using it. Have loved all the Christina Moss products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I enjoy how gentle this facewash is. It smells neutral to me, so there&#x27;s no strong scent that comes with it, and my skin feels clean and refreshed afterwards.</li>
    <li> But right when I used this product my skin felt relieved and revived, its kinda of to soon to tell but after my first wash I am thinking this product is the answer for my skin problems.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and how great my face feels after using it. Already on my second bottle.</li>
    <li> Bought this about a month ago and really like it so far. You only need a small drop to wash your whole face and remove makeup. I have used it twice a day for a month and my husband has been using it pretty regularly too and it is still over 3/4 full. Very good value for how much you get and it&#x27;s very moisturizing as well. Great face wash!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!  I just love this stuff!</li>
    <li> A little definitely goes a long way.  Leaves my face feeling incredibly clean.  I&#x27;m switching to organic personal care products, and am glad to have found this.</li>
    <li> Love this facial cleanser, cleans well, and I know it is totally natural. A delight to use, I want to continue to buy from this amazing company. Check out their moisturizer , they are the best natural moisturizer I had ever used!</li>
    <li> I feel like this is a mediocre product. It had no tingle nor smell. The smell isn&#x27;t the thing that bothered me because I&#x27;m not a fan of smell when it comes to face wash. but the fact that this product recommended an organic moisturizer, mud mask and organic serum (that I purchased at the same time) It&#x27;s difficult to know what product actually works. With the price tag on this natural facial wash, you would think you would see a clear difference a few times after applying, but I did not (with this product alone.) My daily ritual was cleaning my face with this wash, applying the serum, followed by the moisturizer (same name.) I would also apply the &amp;#34;Pure Dead Sea Mud Mask&amp;#34; weekly. The first 2 weeks, my friends noticed the difference, after that, the comments stopped and the mirror told a different story. I do not recommend this specific product but the good thing is that it does come with a 30 day money back guarantee</li>
    <li> Like the results and the feeling of this face wash but don&#x27;t like the price. It&#x27;s a bit pricey for what i am used to buying for face wash. Overall though, I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> MY SKIN IS EXTREMELY SENSATIVE AND I WAS AFRAID TO TRY IT. NO IRRITATION, NO DRY SKIN AND NO BURN. THIS CLEANSER IS WONDERFUL!!  CUSTOMER SERVICE IS UNBELIEVABLE AND, &amp;#34;YES,&amp;#34; I&#x27;M SHOUTING!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It really helps my skin a lot. I like the fact that it is natural and does not have all those harsh chemicals in it.</li>
    <li> This is the best face wash I have ever used, and I used pretty much all of them that are for men.</li>
    <li> Very natural and light and easy to absorb to the skin</li>
    <li> I really like this facial wash.  It rinses clean and doesnt leave my skin dry!  The last organic wash I got, was good but it seems like I couldnt get it all rinsed off and it didnt foam or anything.  This wash is very concentrated so even though the bottle is small you dont use very much at all. I only use a dime size drop, rub my palms together to make a foam and it covers my face and throat and rinses nice and clean.  I highly recommend it !&lt;br /&gt;Everything I get from Christina Moss Naturals has been great so far !  (Moisturizer and facial wash).</li>
    <li> Not real excited about this one. I think it clogged my skin</li>
    <li> I would like to add to all the wonderful reviews with 2 things.&lt;br /&gt;1. I had started a face wash/toner/moisturizer routine that I got from target, Something inexpensive, and that helped immediately. But, after 2 months it seemed like I platoed in improvement and still had break outs just not as bad. Then I decided to try fancier stuff and this clears up everything! And it&#x27;s not harsh but deff use a moisturizer. I no longer need a toner.&lt;br /&gt;  2ndly! One day I sortof got fabric paint all over my hands and through my clothes on my hip and leg (4yr old craft project and they didn&#x27;t have a spot of paint on them!) So anyway, this fabric paint wasn&#x27;t coming off easily and I scrubbed with 2 different soaps, gave up and went to wash my face. When I put this magic stuff on my fingers and rubbed to start making a lather the fabric paint came off. Completely! With very little scrubbing mostly rubbing :D. I also used it to rub off one of those temporary tattoos. Yay!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve just reviewed the moisturizer I use with this If anyone is interested.</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser. It&#x27;s gentle and cleans deeply and actually gets my eye make up off better than any product I&#x27;ve used(washable makeup). I plan to continue to use this product. Very happy with the results.  The bottle is small but I&#x27;ve had mine for a couple of months and barely have made a dent in it.  Only takes a pea sized amount.</li>
    <li> Seems to work fine, too early to tell. But love the timely shipping.</li>
    <li> It was the most expensive face wash I&#x27;d ever bought... and the best by so, so far, that I&#x27;ll be buying it as long as they sell it! I&#x27;ve been using it for the past three months (close to it, anyway), and I&#x27;m only half-way through the bottle. Great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Note: If you&#x27;re like me, you /will/ break out the first few days of using this stuff. I stopped using it and considered returning it, but was advised to try for a week longer before giving up. And I stopped breaking out... and my acne I had previously is almost completely gone. Love it.</li>
    <li> Was not able to use this product..  It dried and irritated my skin after the first use.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that only a small amount is necessary to use!  I love the clean, not dry, feel after using this!!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, prompt service, and very polite associates who strive to meet the satisfaction for every product sold. Bought both the facial moisturizer and face wash. A little goes a long way for both products and both should last more than 3 months. No greasy refection on the moisturizer after use both AM and PM with no excessive dryness from the face wash. Try the product and you won&#x27;t be disappointed. Organic and chemical free, best product by far and gets better with each use...</li>
    <li> Love the Facial product.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive, acne-prone skin, and this cleanser seems to be working well for me. I use it in the morning and use another cleanser with salicylic acid at night. I found that I still had breakouts when I tried to eliminate the salicylic acid from my regimen, but this is still a great product. It smells wonderful and leaves your skin feeling clean and soft. I think it helps balance out the drying effect of the acne cleanser.</li>
    <li> Love this, I use it then use the moisturizer...perfect combo for my very sensitive skin</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me. I gave it 6 weeks and my complexion has not changed. I contacted the company to express my concern on the product relative to the price and they have not gotten back to me. Pretty disappointed and won&#x27;t recommend this to face line to others.</li>
    <li> I have found adult acne for many years with a super sensitive skin. I was nervous I would break out or something but on the contrary!! I have not had one pimple sines using, my skin it clean but not dried out and my skin looks calmer and less red and irritated. Highly recommend you go natural with your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kristie B</li>
    <li> It cleans the face but didnt work for my face I&#x27;ve been got pimples everywhere since I started using it.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser.  I don&#x27;t want to put a bunch of chemicals on my face.  Works great.</li>
    <li> delivery &#x3D; 5/5&lt;br /&gt;quality &#x3D; 5/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i recently switched to natural+organic products and was recommended to christina moss&#x27; products. i have the worst skin combination ever: sensitive, very acne-prone, stubborn scars, and oily skin. but this cleanser just feels so good on my skin. i like how it doesn&#x27;t overdry my skin, which causes irritation to arise. the quantity may seem small at first, but little really does go a long way. will keep purchasing! i&#x27;m also using this w/ their moisturizer.</li>
    <li> First time I have tried any facial organic wash,  If is very fresh no smelly chemicals and does make me feel clean and fresh.  I&#x27;m not glowing but it feels like I am.</li>
    <li> after using and felt my face its so smooth though haven&#x27;t seen much of the effects too i think have to order again</li>
    <li> So gentle on my super sensitive skin.  Smells great, and easily washes off my mascara.</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I have this product in my shower! It&#x27;s amazing. It cleanses the face thoroughly but gently. It smells fresh and clean! I have used so many facial washes in my past and I am honest when I say that I have found the perfect facial wash for my skin. My skin used to be prone to blemishes... but since I have been using this facial wash and the moisturizer, my skin has been looking amazing. My husband actually uses both the wash and moisturizer, which means it is great for all skin types. I highly recommend this product. I already have friends and family interested in it. Cheers to healthy and glowing skin!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good product. It gets the job done, &amp; the most important to me...it is cruelty free. While it is a little high in price for the 4oz bottle,  I&#x27;d rather pay the extra knowing it wasn&#x27;t tested on animals. It&#x27;s good for my sensitive skin, &amp; has no harsh chemicals or fragrance in it.</li>
    <li> Great product and value  - you only need a little and it leaves your skin clean but not dried out. Will definitely buy again as it is the best I have found thus far out of all face washes and especially as I can use it with my Clarisonic as well.</li>
    <li> Really nice gentle face wash, smells good and lasts a long time.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I love the organic facial wash - it works great with the clarisonic pro brush and also used with deep pore cleansing brush. I use this facial wash by alternating once a day this and once a day a certified organic facial cleanser which is not foaming and it works well.  An update: I have been using this facial wash for months now and I am very satisfies with it. It is a favorite of mine.  Recent update: I keep using this facial wash and I am completely satisfied with it :)</li>
    <li> I am liking this facial cleanser. It leaves my skin soft and not dried out after washing. Nor, does it have an oily feel after....just right. I like the fact that I&#x27;m using natural ingredients on my skin instead of chemicals.</li>
    <li> This face wash is HEAVEN SENT!!!!! Before using this cleanser I always used chemical filled face washes as well as moisturizers and all they did was dry out my skin and not exactly help with my acne. I decided to finally go the natural route for my skin, and wow I am so glad I did. This face wash is the definition of perfection in my eyes, it does not dry out my skin it cleans it so well and makes my skin feel so so so soft! (my skin type is somewhat dry with acne) My skin really does feel clean after I use this. I have noticed my acne has improved drastically as well! I am 20 years old and I do not have horrible skin but I do suffer from acne and this face wash has helped it so much! I bought this face wash in November of 2014, and it is now about to be April 2015 and I am going to have to by my second bottle with in the next two weeks or so.....It has lasted me forever! You only need a dime size amount in your hand and it suds up so well. I will never use a different face wash, so please NEVER CHANGE this formula and NEVER STOP making this face wash Christina Moss!!! Im in love! I highly recommend this face wash to anyone who is looking for a natural organic option! You will love it! Also, the moisturizer goes AMAZING with this! I hope this is helpful for anyone who would like to purchase this wonderful product, you will not regret it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had rosacea, reddening of the cheeks, etc., for many years and have done many medical handlings which work but the results do not last.  My wife, bought this Facial Wash for herself years ago and insisted I start using it along with her Facial Moisturizer from Christina.  These products are non irritating and have cleared up the rosacea which has not come back!  I am impressed and have &amp;#34;borrowed&amp;#34; all my wife&#x27;s moisturizer and facial wash!  Sorry, honey.....</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cleanser. I was in desperate need of an all natural facial regimen and finding a natural cleanser was the hardest part. I gave this one a shot and have not been disappointed. The scent isn&#x27;t the best but it is a very nature scent. This bottle us really small but it&#x27;s concentrated so only a very small amount is needed to cleanse the entire face. This is now my go to cleanser. I followup with witch hazel as a toner and aloe Vera gel with almond oil and vitamin E as a moisturizer. All natural ingredients and my face feels amazing.</li>
    <li> I bought this facial wash in a doubt although many great reviews are posted. However, I like all ingredients and formula were synthesized from organic extracts and it was a foam wash without adding sodium lauryl sulfate. So far so good and I will order it again.</li>
    <li> Worst face wash ever. It may just be some of the ingredients that didn&#x27;t react well with my skin but right after using it got super itchy and red and stayed that way even three days after use.</li>
    <li> I love this facial cleanser! It smells nice without having any kind of a perfumy or unnatural scent, and it gets my face clean without leaving it either greasy or stripped of oils. My only complaint (minor) is that it would be nice if it had a pump, as I tend to use too much of it at a time.</li>
    <li> The facial wash is refreshing and a little bit goes a long way.  I can see my skin brighten up with a couple wash.  This is one of the better facial wash I ever purchased.  I would recommend it .</li>
    <li> I waited to write this review until I&#x27;d used the product about a month. I have sensitive skin and hormonal acne issues that flare up at different times throughout a month. This is my favorite face wash I&#x27;ve found so far and my skin has stayed happy the whole month. It leaves my skin with the perfect balanced feeling of clean but not overly stripped. I use jojoba oil/castor oil as a makeup remover and then wash with this. Really great clean feeling skin. At night I follow up with the Christina Moss moisturizer, also great product and during the day I use a moisturizer with spf. The best thing I can say is that this works. Wonderful ingredients too!</li>
    <li> I have been using the facial cleanser for the past two weeks.  I have extremely sensitive skin with acne.  When I first used it, my face burned and felt very hot and dry.  I contacted Christina Moss Naturals and spoke with Kenny.  He was very helpful and stated this is normal until my skin adjusts to the cleanser.  I continued to use and then developed white bumps (acne) under the skin.  I contacted Kenny again and he stated my skin was still adjusting and to give it another week.  My skin no longer burns and my skin feels smoother. I still have some acne, and are hoping that with continued use, this will go away.  Kenny was extremely helpful and gave me a lot of helpful suggestions.  Their customer service is wonderful and I am hoping my skin will continue to improve, as I have tried so many different products with my skin becoming worse.  So far, my skin does seem to be getting better, and I would recommend the cleanser to anyone with sensitive acne skin.</li>
    <li> I have searched high and low for a truly natural product that doesn&#x27;t have anything harmful in it.  It&#x27;s amazing what you can find in the ingredients list of many of the so-called &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products.  This facial wash takes a little getting used to because it doesn&#x27;t have any of the chemicals that would cause it to suds up. Luckily I knew what to expect from reading the reviews.  The bottle is not large, but a little goes a long way - I just use a dab.  It cleans so much better than my Estee Lauder Perfectly Clean which I have used for eons, and leaves my skin so much softer.  I have definitely found my new organic, cruelty free, green, safe and wonderful facial wash. Yaay for me!!</li>
    <li> The soap smells nice and provides a clean feel without over drying. I am not 100% sure I will buy again, but only because it is expensive for a small amount and while I do enjoy it I am not convinced I cannot find another organic product I like just as well for less money.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash! I was hesitant because I&#x27;ve tried so many different face washes. This one works and I am so grateful I no longer have to search for something to clear my face. Also, I wanted to note, this face wash is reasonably priced compared to other organic face washes. The smell is great and my face looks and feels so clean! :)</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive skin - even most face washes marked &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; make me break out. I bought this because my normal stuff is backordered and I needed something in a pinch. Well, it&#x27;s been terrific. I worried that the formulation would be too drying, but it hasn&#x27;t been. It&#x27;s been quite nice, actually!</li>
    <li> One of the best facial wash products I&#x27;ve used. Would say I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 to  8 months now and my skin has never been this consistently clear. I&#x27;ve been through all the harsh chemical products trying to find a routine that worked to no avail, but when i use this it leaves me with a clean look and feel. Plus a little dab goes a long way! Definitely interested in other products that may be offered since my experience with this has been so great.</li>
    <li> make my face feel clean and works well with my face cream.</li>
    <li> Well-done, Christina Moss, well-done!  This is a concentrated, viscous, gentle yet effective face wash (male).</li>
    <li> Absolutely Wonderful!!! Leaves my face feeling fresh and clean without and residue. I will keep using this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the facial wash.  The smallest amount will really do a great job on your face.  It says to use a dime sized amount, but I use just a small drop and it lathers up really well.  This will last a very long time!</li>
    <li> Product is working excellent. A small amount goes a long way. Will order again in the future. Thanks a lot</li>
    <li> I have been using this organic cleaner for about 2 weeks, and I love it so far.  All facial cleaners I have ever used seem to leave a residue on your skin, like your not really clean.  This rinses very easily, and actually gets your skin squeaky clean.  I  have very oily skin, and this seems to help quite a bit. If I continue to like this product, then I will have to try the shampoo next.</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive roscea prone skin....  this is the first facial wash in my life that has truly not irritated my skin. My skin feels clean and calm. It does have a slight fragrance to it, which I love, reminds me of a great spa. I&#x27;m on my sixth bottle now. I really recommend this stuff!</li>
    <li> Wow!  This is an amazing face wash. I have been using it for a little over a week and I can tell a big difference in my skin. It glows!  I&#x27;m only 26 so I don&#x27;t have a lot of skin issues, but the problems I did have with some small bumps on my cheeks and dryness around my eyebrows are gone.  I&#x27;m so glad I found this product!</li>
    <li> Love this, love this, love this.  My face is so clean and so soft, and there&#x27;s no harsh chemicals.  Wonderful smelling and super concentrated, I use a tiny amount.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE! I use all 3 products together, the wash, toner and moisturizer. I used to use irish spring, horrible, but it was the only thing that kept my face clear. When I tried all natural face washes my face would break out in a way I never experienced before. But then came Christina Moss. The Christina Moss products have done nothing but leave my skin supple, smooth and blemish free. It controls and nourishes my skin, I have found the winning products. AND A LITTLE GOES A VEEEERY LONG WAY! My epithelial cells thank thank THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> This cleanser is amazing! I have been using it for about two weeks and it has left my skin so soft and smooth. My blemishes are really clearing up and my face feels so clean all day long. I have combination skin, and this cleanser doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling dry or oily. I love that you only need to use a small amount and that it is organic. Also, it smells heavenly!</li>
    <li> really smooths out my complexion, love it!</li>
    <li> I have only used it a few times so far but so far so good. I like that it is light and refreshing. I feel that it helps clean up any acne that might be trying to break through and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin too dry. I will definitely continue using it.</li>
    <li> This facial wash made my skin very dry and flaky. I don&#x27;t recommend it if you have dry skin.</li>
    <li> Perfect for all skin types. Worth the money. Works great!</li>
    <li> I love this facewash. I made the decision to switch to an organic product and now I can feel good about what I am putting on my face. My skin feels so soft and smooth after using this. You only need a small amount each time. Great product!</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin + free of all the bad things!</li>
    <li> I have been using this face wash for a month. I noticed my pores are clearing but I still break out on occasion. This face wash does not make your face feel dry or oily. My face is clean and soft after using the face wash. It smells nice, lathers well, and I maybe use a dime size drop for my whole face. I am thinking about putting this in a foaming dispenser to extend the life of this product. For $20, this a bargain face wash, considering there are millions of far more expensive and exotic sounding face washes with big promises. I went chemical and toxin free and finding this face wash on amazon was a true blessing. Thanks amazon for selling from small companies.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for a few days, but it seems to wash well and my face feels clean and moist.  The volume is very small for that price so that is why I only give it a 4 star.</li>
    <li> Very good face wash for my rosacea prone combination skin.....non drying and organic.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin or anything and one use of this had me at the dermatologist! The dermatologist confirmed that it was the cause. The poor quality label and strange chemical like smell should have been indicators.</li>
    <li> In love with this face wash!!  I love the smell and my skin feels SO Good and clean!  As if that wasn&#x27;t enough, the fact that it&#x27;s organic and made from essential oils has me overjoyed!  I&#x27;m trying to make the transition to being a chemical free as possible,  having this readily available is so helpful!</li>
    <li> Broke me out REALLY bad. I even followed the maker&#x27;s advice and used it for two straight weeks, but the breakout still only worsened. After the two weeks, I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore. It just didn&#x27;t work for me and I&#x27;ll never use this again</li>
    <li> I have oily/combination skin and after I got pregnant my face was red and pimples all over my face (but I don&#x27;t have cyclic acne) so I used this product and all my pimples are gone. In the past, I was able to control my pimple with organic products with 2% salicylic acid in it but I heard that salicylic acid is not good while I&#x27;m pregnant so I changed it to this. Thank God this is working because I was really starting to get agitated with my skin. Also, I love the fact that this product is all organic!</li>
    <li> This facial wash is very effective and feel good on the skin. The scent is also pleasant and it does the job well. I strongly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used this much, but I can tell I&#x27;m going to like it.</li>
    <li> Such great product. Best face wash I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> Love love love this face wash! It&#x27;s light and easy on my sensitive skin. It takes off my make up and doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes. Christina Moss has amazing costumer service. This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought this product. Also like their facial moisturizer!</li>
    <li> Love this face wash!!! It leaves your skin so clean and refreshed than any other products I&#x27;ve tried. Highly recommended!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this facial wash and a little goes a long way on my Clarisonic.  Smells really good too!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. Leaves my skin feeling so clean, and I love the fact that its organic and cruelty free.  I will definitely purchase again..</li>
    <li> Love this little bottle, great size and the fact it is organic and full of quality ingredients makes me grabbing for it day and night. Plus you only need to use a small amount. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> As most reviewers said, I was hesitant because of the price and size. With getting older and trying to stave off the affects of aging I&#x27;ve been on a mission to rid all my beauty products of chemicals and use only organic. I tried a few face washes in that spectrum, after trying this one I made it my official face wash. You only need a tiny amount so the 4 oz bottle lasts a long time. My skin feels clean and not over dried. I have extremely oily skin, so I&#x27;m prone to breakouts, since using this face wash on a daily basis I have seen a SIGNIFICANT improvement in my complexion. This is totally worth the price.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a natural facial wash and came across this product. I was impressed by the short ingredient list containing familiar items and no harsh chemicals. The rave reviews and product guarantee convinced me to buy. I am very glad I did.  I had dry skin and was starting to get some adult onset acne. After only two weeks this face wash has cleared both problems. My skin is looking fresh enough that I have been able to stop wearing foundation again. I will be purchasing the face moisturizer soon.</li>
    <li> Great product. Could see an immediate improvement in my skins tone and texture.</li>
    <li> The best facial wash I&#x27;ve ever used--and I&#x27;ve tried A LOT of facial cleansers!! I have sensitive, acne-prone skin and this cleanser thoroughly cleanses my skin without irritating it. I&#x27;ve been using Christina Moss Naturals products for about 2 months now, and my breakouts have diminished significantly in both frequency and severity. In fact, I haven&#x27;t had a breakout since I began using these products. I couldn&#x27;t be happier or more satisfied. Also, the customer service is unbelievable!! I heart Christina Moss Naturals!</li>
    <li> I have been using this 2x/day with my Clarisonic on my normal/combination skin for about 2.5 weeks now.  It&#x27;s refreshing, leaves your face clean and smooth.  At first, it seemed like I may have had an initial breakout caused by either this or an organic 20% Vitamin C serum since I began using both the same day.  My skin does seem brighter and is now clearing up. Tea tree is great for fading scars so I&#x27;m sure over time, in combination with the serum, my post-acne scars from teenage years will fade, since I am starting to see a difference.  However...I was also doing an experiment and had gotten a microdermabrasion and extraction facial previously last month after over 1.5 years (and my skin was pretty clear). Returning from the facial, my face looked pulverized (still have the healing scars from that). Since my face was already messed up, in the name of science, I decided to conduct an experiment on myself.  I stayed up late, didn&#x27;t manage my stress, ate out, and didn&#x27;t exercise that much. So as of August 1, I had horrible skin/acne. It&#x27;s almost been a week and I&#x27;ve reverted to all natural products, including this one, have been exercising regularly and eating very healthy. I&#x27;m trying to work up to 9 hours of sleep (struggling to get 7.5 atm because I&#x27;m moving) since that&#x27;s my optimum performance sleep amount.    That being said, in conclusion, I would definitely recommend this face wash, in combination of diet, exercise, and stress management and a consistent routine.      UPDATE: 2.5 Months After Use     Unfortunately, I thought this may have been the best thing, but now I&#x27;m having second thoughts. I think it&#x27;s a bit too harsh; I wish I could return it but it&#x27;s past the return window. I still think it&#x27;s refreshing and such, but it seems like it has caused my eyes to have an allergic reaction/created puffiness/deep creases - not that I use it directly on the eyes, but it does go around them. I&#x27;ve never had them before and now I&#x27;m devastated, especially since I&#x27;m only 25...planning on discontinuing use and maybe using it for a body wash since it was kind of expensive.</li>
    <li> I used this product and it left my skin super squeaky clean WITHOUT it feeling dried out or having that tight face..just got botox.. stripped of any moisture, desert feeling. I&#x27;ll definitely be using this morning and night! :)</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic! It doesn&#x27;t dry my sensitive face out but yet cleans beautifully. It has a very refreshing smell and cooling effect and gets rid of make up effortlessly. A little goes a long way. I will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> This is the best cleanser that I ever used in America. It cleans face very gently and very thoroughly. I ever tried many other kinds of cleansers, but this is the one that I will keep using.</li>
    <li> Love this facewash. I had been searching far and wide for an all-natural foaming to use with my Clarisonic. This product is amazing -- it foams with my Clarisonic and leaves my skin smooth and clean, but not overly dry. Furthermore, this is one of the only REALLY, TRULY NATURAL facewashes that I could find -- love this product and what it&#x27;s doing for my skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the moisturizer from this company for several weeks and I love it!  I decided to try the facial cleaner and I have been using it for almost a week.  These are excellent products.  At first I thought the price was a bit steep for such small quantities of product, but a little really does go a long way and these products leave your skin so soft and smooth.  Even the next morning you can still feel the difference in your skin.  Follow up communication from the company is excellent.  Products are made in small batches because they do not use chemicals as preservatives.  I have used many facial products in my 57 years and this is, by far, the best I have used.</li>
    <li> If you have oily skin don&#x27;t get this! I forgot to check that and just got excited about the reviews. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s as awesome as everyone says it is but definitely not if you have oily skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a while. It cleans well and does not sting the eyes. My face feels very smooth after cleaning my face with it.</li>
    <li> While this product did not give me the results I was hoping for, the customer service from Christina Moss Naturals is exceptional.  They worked with me to try to get me the hoped for results.  I do think this is an excellent product, just not right for my very irritable skin.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, but very expensive! I love it, but probably won&#x27;t re order. It is very cost prohibitive.</li>
    <li> Very high quality and wonderful cleanser for the money.  Makes skin feel soft and hydrated and clean.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Was for my daughter, she has just begun to use it and likes everything about it. Only hesitant to give it a five star because of its natural scent. She isn&#x27;t quite a teen yet but had an occasional blemish or two every once in a while along her hair line. She wasn&#x27;t really concerned with washing her face separately or beyond in the shower so I decided to get her a face wash but definitely didn&#x27;t want to use anything harsh so finding something natural was definitely the way I wanted to go!</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best facial care I have ever invested my money in! It&#x27;s worth it. My skin feels new!</li>
    <li> I ONLY use this Facial Wash after finding it three years ago.  It is great and keeps my skin young and moist looking as opposed to how dry it was before.  Service is FAST and I always get the best of help if I have any questions.</li>
    <li> This facial wash is the best product.  After using this cleanser my face feels  so clean and soft like baby skin. I finally found the excellent cleanser. Love it! 5 stars from me.</li>
    <li> Love this face wash.  So nice to have something that works so well and I don&#x27;t have to worry about any bad ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;This cleaner leaves my face clean but not dried out.</li>
    <li> Really nice on sensitive skin, cleans without feeling dry.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this</li>
    <li> Only been a week, but I like it so far.  Nice and natural ingredients.  Smells like rosemary which is quite refreshing.</li>
    <li> I recently found this cleanser thanks to the \\&quot;Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought\\&quot; feature on Amazon. ....and I am glad that I did. I had been using a nice \\&quot;au naturel\\&quot; Spa Brand but was out of the product when I noticed this item listed at the bottom of the page. This is a great cleanser and I love the clean ingredient deck...cannot go wrong with Coconut Oil or the other ingredients. I thought at first it might be strong because I could smell it through the packaging....(before it was opened).... I have really sensitive skin and I have not had a problem.... I also purchased the moisturizer.</li>
    <li> The only product that has worked other than proactiv! :)</li>
    <li> Was frantically trying to find a soothing skin cleanser. I found it! After using this cleanser, I apply the Peak Products Vitamin C Serum and Christina Moss Moisturizer. Follow up e-mails offer great tips on the best ways to use their products. The entire Christina Moss products collection and Peak Products Vitamin C Serum are great!</li>
    <li> The product itself smells great.  You do need to use a makeup remover prior to using this product.  It foams well and I feel like it leaves my skin clean.  I love that it is organic and 100% natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only critique is the label.  If it gets wet (from leaving your bottle in the shower or handling it with wet hands), it begins to crinkle and fall off.  I just wish it was vinyl printed or something so that I didn&#x27;t end up with pieces of the label in my hand while I am trying to wash my face.</li>
    <li> Great product,non drying cleans very well.</li>
    <li> This cleanser has a nice foamy feel to it after I rub it on my face. My face always feels clean and I know it gets rid of my acne. I would definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> I like this product cause it leaves my skin clean and fresh. Thanks</li>
    <li> This cleanser smells fresh and has worked wonders on my acne. My face is clearer and feels amazing!!! I love this stuff!!! The face mask is also amazing!  I highly recommend these products. My mom has been borrowing these when she comes over, for her eczema and she loves them as well!!! You&#x27;re going to love this seller and products!!!</li>
    <li> I love this facial wash. It&#x27;s very gentle and makes my face feel very clean. You only need a drop to cleanse your entire face. I&#x27;m going to have my 11 year old daughter use it as well. I love the fact that they send you tips on how to take care of your face.  I will be ordering another bottle.</li>
    <li> I am using this product for 2 months and really like it. After wash my face, my face does not feel dry but clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using it because I finally found my face wash.</li>
    <li> I was a lifetime Oil of Olay user, so it took a lot for me to make the plunge. However, my family has been eating and using more organic products and I love this line! I use this facial wash, along with the face moisturizer, and it does a great job cleansing my face with no residue. This product does not burn the eyes and removes makeup really well. Nice fragrance also! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I used this product and till now there&#x27;s no outbreaks, and i&#x27;m curious what the result is in a month (i&#x27;m using for 2 weeks straight). Its thick and doesn&#x27;t latter. But I still loved it. The smell was a bitt strong but now i&#x27;m adapted.</li>
    <li> clean, great for all skin types and a great value.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and after using oil cleansing method with Argan oil and sweet almond oil for quite sometime, I thought it&#x27;s time for me to switch to a more convenient way of cleansing. Since I adore using natural oil, I decided to try this product as it contained varies natural oil and minimum ingredients.  But never would I imagine, after one wash, my face turned red and itchy and more red pimples appeared the next day. I was so upset! Now I am still struggling to deal with my agitated skin and if it doesn&#x27;t get better, I need to see a dermatologist.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best face wash I&#x27;ve ever used. I have moderate eczema on my face and neck; this is the first face wash I&#x27;ve used that leaves me feeling refreshed and removes my makeup without having to douse my face in heavy acne-inducing lotion immediately following. A little pricey, but a little of the wash really does go a long way. The price is absolutely worth it.</li>
    <li> I tried this out today, and it works amazing. I have sensitive skin so most products tend to dry it out, but this one made my face soft. It may be a small bottle for a high price but it only takes a drop or two to cover your whole face with it so it will last a while. Worth the buy.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash! It smells great, suds up nicely, removes my make-up easily, and best of all it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling dry or tight. I&#x27;ve been using this twice daily for almost a month. I have (well, had!) fussy skin that easily becomes too dry or too oily. I&#x27;ve been following this up with witch hazel daily and a clay mask a couple times a week- I haven&#x27;t needed to use moisturizer since I started this regimen. My skin feels &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; for once! It&#x27;s expensive for the size of the bottle, but a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I love the all natural ingredients. It&#x27;s so difficult to find a facial wash without SLS that still leaves your skin feeling refreshed. This wash is perfect and leaves your skin feeling so clean. It doesn&#x27;t make your skin dry either. Fantastic and very friendly customer service as well!! Love the company!</li>
    <li> Amazing!! Hands down, this is everything that I ever wanted in a cleanser!! Has literally changed my life!! If you have psoriasis on your face then this is absolutely the cleanser that you should be using. I literally want to cried tears of happiness for what these products have done for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this and the moisturizer together and I love them both.  This cleanser is not only effective, but my face feels very clean afterwards - not dry or like there is a film over my skin.  Perfect!  And it is concentrated, so I use just a dab - about the size of a pencil eraser - to wash my entire face.  I&#x27;m definitely a repeat buyer!</li>
    <li> This is my second order. There is much to be said about washing your face with 100% NATURAL ingredients. The Facial Moisturizer (separate product) is again, very highly recommended. It&#x27;s light and creamy.</li>
    <li> My second purchase of this and I love it.  Clear skin and pores, but no tightness or irritation.  Love that it is organic!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase a $20 bottle of face wash. It&#x27;s a lot of money for a college student and the bottle is only 4 oz! The small size of the bottle was definitely concerning, but the product is so concentrated you only have to use a small amount to get the job done. This is the best face wash I&#x27;ve used. My face feels so clean after I wash it and it&#x27;s a different kind of clean compared to other face washes. I can&#x27;t really explain it but it feels nice! Once you get over the price of such a tiny bottle, it&#x27;s a really good product. (Purchased product Mid-May)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 7/28/14&lt;br /&gt;I just want to say that not only is this face wash really great, so is the customer service. I bought another bottle of face wash this weekend and it arrived today. When I saw the product I noticed the consistency looked watered down. Usually the face wash is slow moving the the bottle, but this one was very fluid. I wanted to know if they changed the formula so I sent the owner of the company, Kenny, an email. He responded to my email promptly and explained that the formula didn&#x27;t change, but the consistency of one of the ingredients was off. He was nice enough to offer a replacement bottle and I am very pleased with how things were handled.</li>
    <li> I recently bought the Christina Moss moisturizer and loved it so I decided to try her facial cleanser and really loved it!! it left my skin feeling so clean! I look forward to trying more Christina Moss products!! I should mention that my skin is very sensitive and I have adult acne. It is difficult to find products that my face can handle and not break out from. So far so good with Christina Moss!!</li>
    <li> So nice. Really work for me and for my husband.</li>
    <li> This is a really great facewash. It literally gets your face squeaky clean but doesn&#x27;t dry out skin, or at least it doesn&#x27;t mine and I have pretty sensitive skin. It also takes a very small amount to lather enough for your whole face.</li>
    <li> So I come home to find my facial wash delivered right on time.  As I walk into my house I come to find that it has been ransacked by thieves.  My belongings have been strewn across the floor, my dressers have been tipped over and the drawers emptied.  As I creep threw my ransacked home panic strikes me at my core.  I think, what if these vagrants are still in my home?! I immediately dial 911 and explain the situation.  The police plead with me not to re-enter the house.  At the behest of the police I press on.... I must know if they found it... I must know if they found the computer chip..... Facial wash was good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really in love with this cleanser... I love that a little goes a long way, it smells great, and is made from organic- quality ingredients. For me having a cleanser that gets nice and bubbly is important, and this one does! Also, I have very dry cheeks and this doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my skin, especially sense it lathers so well. Christina Moss has found a loyal customer in me:) Not to mention their customer service is outstanding:)</li>
    <li> Cleans well and is organic.  Nice combination when you are trying to stay away from dangerous chemicals in your hygiene products.  Has a nice relaxing lavender fragrance.  Not too strong and is great to use at night before bed.</li>
    <li> I bought this to try out on a whim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only a tiny bit (the size of your pinky fingernail) is necessary to wash your entire face.  It doesn&#x27;t dry the skin out either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I&#x27;d found this product sooner... soaps were always drying out my skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this since July. My face is tingly, clean feeling, not tight or dry feeling. A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Yes it is expensive, but it&#x27;s all natural and lasts a long time. I was happy with the purchase</li>
    <li> Amazing face wash ! My face feels so much better !</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best face wash that I&#x27;ve ever used. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, makes my face brighter and smoother. I can see a visible difference in my skin texture. This smells strongly of rosemary. I have been using this in conjunction with their moisturizer for the last ten days and there is a huge improvement in my skin. I&#x27;m happy to have finally found a line that works for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have mild-moderate acne prone skin and using this face wash has left my skin smoother. I switched to this product after running out of my commercialized chemical facial wash and this is by far my favorite.</li>
    <li> This is a very gentle but effective face wash. It is the right balance between removing the daily gunk off your face and leaving your skin feeling hydrated. The price point may seem a little high, but it&#x27;s true when they say a little goes a long way so a bottle lasts a while. A month ago, this would&#x27;ve received five stars, however the last bottle that I ordered had a much stronger odor that reminded me of Robitussin. Maybe they changed the formula? I preferred the near odorlessness of the previous bottles I ordered.</li>
    <li> So far so good, only had it for two days but I can tell its cleaning out my pores, they are rising to the surface to hopefully be forever gone or mostly forever gone after getting into a better habit of using it. Definitely recommend</li>
    <li> I love it and get so many compliments on my skin now.</li>
    <li> 20.00 for a 4oz bottle can seem a bit pricey but, I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a year and have found that you need very little to wash as it foams really nicely.  Has a nice clean fragrance.  Shipping can take a bit long but, id say its worth the wait.</li>
    <li> My face feels clean and fresh after using this product.  It has a hint of eucalyptus that I find refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for 4 stars and not 5, is that it is expensive for such a small bottle.  I realize a little goes a long way, but it is still too expensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;M HOOKED! I Love this facial wash. I was looking for something for combination skin; I&#x27;ve got extremely dry patches on my forehead and cheeks and greasy nose and chin area (no acne but I have red blotches and psoriasis on my forehead). After reading the reviews of this product and seeing that it was 100% natural ingredients I had to try it. I am so glad I did! the wash itself is super light and smells SO GOOD but it lathers up really nice and just a little does go a long way. I also purchased the face moisturizer that goes along with this and I highly recommend you get the set! After using the wash and the moisturizer 2 times a day for a week the psoriasis patches on my forehead and eyebrows are GONE! as in no longer on my face!!! All that is left is smooth beautiful skin underneath. Every red blotch is gone, every flaky patch of skin is GONE and my skin has never felt so smooth! I can&#x27;t stop touching my face actually. this wash works! I have used Neutrogena facial washes for years I have not switched facial washes in about 15 years, I will NOT go back, this is my new facial wash! A great product!</li>
    <li> Great product! Smells amazing! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Skin is very dry after use.&lt;br /&gt;Feel like I have residue post use.&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the best facial wash I have ever used. It smells really, really good and doesn&#x27;t strip all of the oils from my face. My face even feels moisturized after I rinse it off :) I&#x27;ve been using it every day and still have a mostly full bottle, so it&#x27;s pretty good for the budget as well. I just ordered the facial moisturizer and cannot wait to try it too!    UPDATE: I have now been using the facial wash for about 6 months, and the moisturizer for about 5 months. Even though my acne has not went away completely, there is definitely a difference. The breakouts are minimizing and I&#x27;m also noticing that the tone of my skin is more even. The red blemishes from previous breakouts are starting to fade away, and the fine lines around my eyes aren&#x27;t as noticeable. This is not a product that is going to give you instant results, but it will make a difference if you are using it consistently. Also worth mentioning is the fact that the moisturizer keeps my face moisturized all day, despite living in a very dry, high-altitude environment. You can&#x27;t beat the customer service either!</li>
    <li> The facial wash is great - I immediately saw a difference in my skin - it feels and looks clean! Would definitely recommend the product for someone looking for a good, gentle and cleansing facial wash.</li>
    <li> My face feels clean and my skin has gotten much nicer!!!</li>
    <li> i resolved a lot of acne with this. i feel good when i use it and my skinniest madly creating new oils to make up for it being so dry. i&#x27;m loving it.</li>
    <li> I have used everything from bar soap to MD forte with retinal to Obagi. This facial wash does not suds and rinses off very easily. Does not feel drying and the Lavender is WONDERFUL!!! Nothing will help my old skin look young but this helps it feel young</li>
    <li> I suffer from moderate acne and this product makes my face feel hella clean.</li>
    <li> I finally found a facial wash that I am completely satisfied with! The fact that it is 100% organic and doesn&#x27;t have ingredients you can&#x27;t pronounce is what inspired me to try this product. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like most facial washes do, and a little goes a long way! I will be using this product forever!</li>
    <li> Organic wash that cleans like soap. A small amount does a wonderful job.</li>
    <li> When I received the facial wash, I was &amp;#34;sold&amp;#34; upon first use. My expectations about this product (based on the information I had found online) were not just met, they were exceeded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is the product really free of harsh chemicals, it deeply cleanses and moisturizes my face, so that my skin feels smooth and soft even before using a moisturizer. The pure essential rosemary oil turns washing my face into a wonderful aroma therapy. I am very sensitive to any synthetic fragrance and never use products with artificial scents because they will give me headache. Hence, my body&#x27;s reaction is the best proof that Christina Moss Naturals indeed uses only pure essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The facial wash is of such exceptional quality that I decided to purchase the moisturizer, shampoo, and conditioner as well. All items arrived fast, and I have used them ever since. They brighten my days because I feel so pampered and happy after washing my face and hair. I already gave samples to a friend who also has been looking desperately for REAL natural products. I guess we found them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your dedication to quality and service. And thank you even more for keeping the promises that are printed on your product labels.</li>
    <li> So my whole life I struggled with my skin and tried so many different things that only seemed to aggravate or make things worse. My skin doesn&#x27;t get too much acne but do struggle with clogged/dirty pores, uneven skin texture, weird marks etc.. Worse thing was I&#x27;m Korean so many of my friends have naturally great skin. My boyfriend surprisingly told me about his face wash and told me to wash my face simply once or twice day (strictly just this face wash and no other skin product). I was skeptical at first but after 2 months my skin is really amazing (even tones and no clogged pores) and I haven&#x27;t had a single pimple since! It might seem a bit pricey but trust me this face wash is true genius.</li>
    <li> I have been using this facial wash for over a week now. My skin feels clean and smooth after cleansing. Smells good too. This does not leave any kind of residue on my skin, just feels very clean. Love that there are no harmful chemicals and is 100% organic.</li>
    <li> I was soooo..... Pleasantly surprised by how well this cleanzer works. My face is so hard to keep free from blackheads. I can&#x27;t use the teen stuff because I am 52, it seriously dries my skin out. Having hormonal acne is completely different. It did everything it claims and more. I am sure it works well for all ages, but works even better for menapousal aged women. I get more acne in my late fourties, and early fifties then I did going through adolescence. It does work, give this a try for problem skin.</li>
    <li> My low rating is because of the price increase of $5 in  just two months. I love the cleanser and it is great for sensitive skin like mine. However, I feel it is unfair for loyal customers when all of the sudden you find a $5 increment on the same product for which I paid $19.99 just two months ago.</li>
    <li> This is amazing stuff.  I have tried all kinds of expensive cleansers and products that only dry out my daughter&#x27;s skin or do nothing for her acne.  This is gentle and affective.  I noticed her face was breaking out more and then realized we had run out of this product. My son just turned 12 and is starting to get an occasional rare bump or two and he won&#x27;t tolerate that, so he is using it as well.   We also use Calcarea Sulphurica 6X, #3 Hylands 500 Tabs from Hylands to clear out all the impurities from internally.  It also has helped with breakouts immensely.  It is homeopathic and great for clearing up middle ear infections, cysts and such.</li>
    <li> love it, after finish my other lotions, i may try their lotion too</li>
    <li> I am in love with this face wash. I look forward to washing my face even more so now because of this product. It doesn&#x27;t dry or irritate. My face feels really clean.</li>
    <li> shipping is super fast and very well packed. The product is gentle for my sensitive skin. Recommend the product to the people whose skin is sensitive.</li>
    <li> The product got here quickly so that was good. Unfortunately I had to stop using it. It dried my skin out really bad and made my breakouts worse. It&#x27;s going to be added to the abandoned products under my bathroom sink that I can&#x27;t bring myself to throw away, because I spent money on them.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe natural stuff can be THAT good. I am very impressed and my face is clean and happy. I have a combination oily skin and live in tropics.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very gentle. Normally I break out after switching to a new product and that didn&#x27;t happen here. The smell is interesting, though. To me it&#x27;s like Vick&#x27;s vapor rub. I use the moisturizer right afterward so the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> It made my skin dry and itchy.  I returned it.</li>
    <li> Nice and refreshing, I added a little of the walnut powder which is crushed walnut shell powder, for a light face scrub and all I can say is that I was impressed! My face felt smooth and it sure helped my oily face and  blemishes! I will buy again little expensive, but it is worth the money!</li>
    <li> Terrible give zero stars, caused an allergic reaction that even two months later seeing the effects of.  Would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash, clean my skin perfectly and without the dryness. The smell is beautiful, very calming herbs fragrant. I&#x27;m keeping this product as must have from now on!</li>
    <li> I really like this natural face cleanser.  I am a vegan and purchase only organic and non gmo&#x27;d products.  So far this cleanser removes my mineral makeup and cleans my face very well!  I would recommend it for all skin types.</li>
    <li> By far the best product I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve tried plenty of different products that claimed to be for &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;hypoallergenic&amp;#34; and they all would cause my skin to dry up or give me rashes or even hives. This product, in conjunction with the facial moisturizer, have given me great results. I will admit that the sizes of the products were super smaller than I expected but you only need about a dime size of the face wash anyway.</li>
    <li> So tiny bottle! I am surprised! But I love how it feels when I used it. It really cleans and leaves that fresh feeling without drying my skin. Excellent stuff. Pricey but a little goes a long way so I think it pays off. I love it because it suits my combination skin.</li>
    <li> I tried this because of all the great reviews. Now I&#x27;ll add my own.  The bottle is on the small side - that might be the first thing you notice. The instructions are to use a dime sized amount. Personally I&#x27;m using a &amp;#34;ladybug&amp;#34; size amount because the product is so concentrated. I can see this lasting six months so don&#x27;t let the product size fool you. It&#x27;s rich and non drying. My skin feels so clean and conditioned after each use. I then apply the moisturizer which I also love. Have already submitted a review for that.</li>
    <li> Easy on the skin, organic, and very simple. I enjoy simple and natural products. This leaves my skin feeling great and not dry like other face washes.</li>
    <li> I bought this after deciding to go as organic and toxic-free as possible. Here are the things I like about this product: It&#x27;s organic, foams up nicely, smooth feel to the skin after using. I will definitely buy this again as well as other products in this line. It is a bit pricey, but, I am willing to pay for something that Is organic and doesn&#x27;t include the chemicals found in a lot of personal care products (actually most products). (I always try to check out the ratings and ingredients on EWG&#x27;s skin deep site.)</li>
    <li> This is my second time buying this facial wash.  At first, I thought the bottle was a bit small for the price.  But it lasted me a looooong time.  And it did wonders for my somewhat finicky skin.  I no longer have blackheads and my pores are noticeably smaller.  It&#x27;s a good quality wash that I can trust isn&#x27;t clogging my pores with chemicals.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> It is so important that what we put ON our bodies is as healthy as what we put IN our bodies.&lt;br /&gt;I love this face wash. It&#x27;s organic. It&#x27;s cost efficient; I only have to use the tiniest drop to lather up enough to wash my face, so it will last a very long time, and the fragrance is subtle. Best of all, my skin feels soft and smooth. I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I really liked this stuff, but it was sorta spendy for the amount you get.</li>
    <li> I purchased Christina Moss Naturals Facial Wash at the same time as I purchased the Christina Moss Facial Moisturizer, and both products are awesome. Normally I used an olive oil based soap for cleansing my face, but thought it might be better to use a wash made specifically for the face. This facial wash is the best thing I have ever used. It only takes a few drops in my hand with a bit of water, and instantly my makeup is gone, and my face feels soft as well as refreshed. I highly recommend this product, regardless of age, or type of skin.</li>
    <li> Faced breaking out more than usual even after patiently using it for a few weeks.  For the sake of money I&#x27;m still using this face wash but not the moisturizer.  I felt the moisturizer had a strange odor I just couldn&#x27;t get use to and I believe using Christina Moss face wash, Vitamin C as a serum and Arbonne Intellegrnce Rejuvenating Cream is a great regemim for now.</li>
    <li> As bought this facial as am trying to be as natural as possible and using less chemicals on my very delicate skin.  I was hesitant as I was using Bobby Brow&#x27;s cleansing oil which I  absolutely love as it cleans the face and the eyes... One product as suppose to two. But I was pleasantly surprise how good this cleanser work.  You do have to clean twice to remove the mascara but they recommend doing it anyway.  It feels really clean after using it and it has a good aroma.</li>
    <li> Love this face wash, very fresh feeling without being drying</li>
    <li> I felt it dried up my face little but it cleanses and smells really good.</li>
    <li> The BEST face wash I&#x27;ve ever used! (I&#x27;ve tried many) After the first use, my skin was already less red and irritated. I have extremely sensitive skin, that even all the &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; face washes will rile up. I have adult acne, and it has been pretty bad lately. This face wash helped after one use. My skin never felt so clean! And without drying it out! I&#x27;m so happy to have found this product. Thank you Christina Moss Naturals!</li>
    <li> I like the face wash. I did nt see any drastic difference since I am using it for 3/4 days. I am happy with the smell and the fact that it is chemical free.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this facial wash for the past couple of weeks and it works fantastic. My skin feels fresh, clean and not dried out after using it. And my skin looks so much better. It no longer feels bumpy and irritated like it would after using a mainstream/chemically cleanser. It really is a fantastic product! You also don&#x27;t have to use very much of it in each use. I also highly recommend her moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have a sensitive and dry skin. It works just perfectly fine to me. It&#x27;s even better than a product that costs few times higher than its.</li>
    <li> I was  little skeptical when it first showed up as the bottle is much smaller than I realized.  That said, I use VERY little each time as not much is needed and my skin feels great.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful facial cleanser!  My face feels clean, not dried out, and healthy after using.  You don&#x27;t need much-a little goes a long way.  I follow up using Christina Moss&#x27;s facial moisturizer which is equally awesome.  You won&#x27;t regret purchasing these products.  You will have healthier skin and feel great about it being all natural!  I highly recommend!!  UPDATE:  I have also found this cleanser excellent to clean make-up brushes.  You only need a tiny amount and the results are great!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. It feels so good on my skin and rinses so clean that I look forward to washing my face now. I also have sensitive skin, and this has not given me a single problem.</li>
    <li> Helps me with my acne... It smells nice and is very gentle on the skin.</li>
    <li> I usually get a pimple on my chin after I use 99.9% of products but not with this. I truly saw an improvement after my first time. I have a few blemishes from trying other things &amp; this wash made them almost vanish the first time. My pores looked better after one time too &amp; that&#x27;s what I was aiming for. I just didn&#x27;t expect it so quickly. After a full week I still have no breakouts &amp; continue to see progress. I actually just ordered the moisturizer because I can only imagine how much better I can look &amp; feel with the combination. I would like to thank their customer service representative for being just wonderful to me. Quick response &amp; endless help. Wonderful company &amp; products. Please do not be afraid to buy such a small bottle because a dime size is more than enough. It will last you a good while &amp; it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
    <li> A little goes a very long way. It is a very good cleaning agent and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
    <li> Very good face wash. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry at all that other face washes have left my face feeling that aren&#x27;t natural. Whether natural or not is your thing is pretty irrelevant in my view as this is simply a superior face wash. My skin feels very clean and I am very happy with my purchase. The face wash took off all of the oils and was simply left clean. My business with them will continue and I hope to see their product expand!</li>
    <li> In just over a week my skin looks younger and fresher. After I wash, my skin feels tight and clean. I feel like my skin is brigher and it looks healthier.</li>
    <li> love it will order again</li>
    <li> I really feel like it worked well. It left my skin feeling really clean. Plus I like that it&#x27;s 100% natural. A little goes a long way, too.</li>
    <li> I recently tried Christina Moss&#x27; Naturals Facial Wash and am truly impressed. I chose to try this product because it contained NO harmful chemicals of any kind (no SLS, SLES, PG, PG derivatives, parabens, sulfates, dyes or synthetic fragrance) and is Hypoallergenic. . IT is also said to do wonders for sensitive skin. I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest unbiased opinion/review. After trial of this product I can honestly admit to loving it &amp; feel it greatly improved the condition of my skin and pores in just a few uses. All it took was a dime size drop to clean my whole face so little of the product was needed. This 4 oz bottle goes a long way! My favorite part about this product is it is Made with certified organic, 100% Natural Ingredients NO toxic chemicals &amp; I felt it cleansed my skin well.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash, it does not dry my skin</li>
    <li> Good product.  Has integrity</li>
    <li> I love this face wash. I decided to start using all natural products on my skin about a month ago and I found this which had great reviews on Amazon. I am so glad I got it. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and my skin feels amazing - silky smooth and oil-free. I have acne prone skin and after I started to use this product I&#x27;ve noticed that I get fewer blemishes. In addition to its effect on my skin, the face wash smells great.</li>
    <li> Love this face wash! Been looking for a good organic face wash and I found it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter in law as a gift. Here is what she says &amp;#34; I love that when I use it, it removes makeup and grime without making my face feel dry and parched after using. I love the rosemary oil in it and the brisk essential oils again are awesomely refreshing. Casey Clarke</li>
    <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;The product was advertised as effective against acne, and it did nothing! I was very disappointed!</li>
    <li> I LOVES THIS STUFF.  Seriously, I do.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for about two weeks now, but I can already feel and see a difference in my skin.  As others have said, the bottle is small, but a little facial wash goes a long way.  I have never been loyal to any one skin care brand...but now I will be. Thanks for such a great product.</li>
    <li> Now it might be too early to call, but I definitely love this facial wash. I&#x27;m an African American 22yr old and I&#x27;ve had mild acne since middle school. I&#x27;ve been to multiple dermatologists within Kaiser Permanente&#x27;s network but all they prescribe are active sulfates that make your skin so much worse from the start. This cleanser in just a week has given me better results than most of the dermatologist-recommended stuff. Makes you wonder why more doctors don&#x27;t prescribe these &amp;#34;organic and natural&amp;#34; products.</li>
    <li> I liked it just fine, though I&amp;#34;m not convinced it&#x27;s worth the price. As such, I will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Have tried a lot of cleansers.  This one made my skin instantly better and the irritated feeling of my skin is gone.  I&#x27;m hoping this one lasts in terms of impact (I&#x27;ve changed cleansers before, been thrilled at first, then disappointed as they stop working).  I&#x27;m going to keep my fingers crossed that this is &amp;#34;the one.&amp;#34;  You need use only a drop, it lathers up great.</li>
    <li> Very good product and there was very good customer service.&lt;br /&gt;Winning combination !!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Exceeded expectations! -great product! -pleasant-feeling, does a great job of removing oils, accumulations, etc., no fragrance, just great product  which actually works- ingredients are wholesome, and non-offensive, a genuine bargain! Worth every penny- -non-irritating, pleasant to use, disperses well, rinses off well.</li>
    <li> One of the greatest face washes I&#x27;ve ever used. I noticed a difference from day one, and my skin has improved ever since. Its been about two weeks, and my skin is almost completely clear. I&#x27;m so happy.</li>
    <li> This face wash is great. It Has a fresh smell and I love the fact it is organic. Feels fresh and feels like it cleans face well, noticed somewhat difference in the acne. Will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> Great stuff!!! Smells great, gentle non drying cleanser.  LOVE IT!!  Thanks so much for such awesome products :)  Takes a very small amount so no worries about the size</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a super grate product that I&#x27;ve ever tried before. I&#x27;ve used this face wash for a week. It has worked well on my skin. I read their beauty tip on their own website. I use my Clinique moisturizer gel to rub my make up by cotton pads, then I wash my face with this nice facial wash. Day by day, I apply foundation everyday but don&#x27;t need to worry about breaking out any more. It helps me clean my face gently and doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry. My skin looks healthier, especially black heads are gone.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Does a great job and it&#x27;s organic</li>
    <li> I love this wash. You need a very small amount to make a lot of lather. It goes on smooth and feels so refreshing!!!!</li>
    <li> I am 59 years old, still suffering from acne-prone skin. This is the first product ever to clear my complexion!</li>
    <li> Gentle yet effective soap. Pleasant clean smell. My small blemishes on my forehead under my bangs are clearing up since using this soap. My husband loves it too!</li>
    <li> Best facial wash ever!!</li>
    <li> This product is the best! What I love about it is that you only need a tiny bit and it does the job, but the best part is how soft it makes your face feel! Guarantee you will love this face wash, it feels great and your skin feels so smooth afterwards.</li>
    <li> I did not see anything special? I think the reviews are wrong.</li>
    <li> I bought this along with the moisturizer.  I did feel like the face wash dried my skin out a little at first.  But once my skin adjusted its been great, my face feels clean and refreshed after using it.  I&#x27;ll definitely continue buying this and appreciate that it is all-natural option that actually works!</li>
    <li> this wash did not work for me, it made my face dry and red and it also make it itch!!! it does clean well and clean all the makeup but again not very moisturizing at all. My face prior to this was moisturized and suppled and I just wanted to switch to more of a chemical free and safe wash and this took the life out of my face, so dry the skin around my nose was peeling off.</li>
    <li> BEST facial wash I&#x27;ve ever found! It might smell kind of strange at the very first use, but it help with my skin well! It is ture that this product is super concentrated, do not over use it :P</li>
    <li> This face wash is fantastic. I bought it to use with my mia clarisonic and it&#x27;s perfect. A little bit goes a long way and my skin is better than ever. I noticed the difference immediately.</li>
    <li> Best face wash! Does not try out your skin and great for blemishes!! My skin looks and feels great!</li>
    <li> I was spending hundreds of dollars on Eminence products and getting no results. I am a 30 year old mom of three and just could not seem to clear my acne. I opted to try this instead of Eminence several weeks ago, and am SO pleased! Every trace of eye makeup-GONE... every pore seems cleaner and free of debris... oil and sebum production has almost normalized...pustules are disappearing!! Finally my skin looks healthy! I wash with this product almost every night, unless I do not wear makeup, and most mornings, followed by spritzing rose water on my face then gently applying a drop or two of tea tree oil, and every once in awhile a couple drops of lavender, a favorite eye cream (please Christina Moss make one!!!!!) and voilà! Every other day I do a homemade mask of a blend of Moroccan Red Clay, mix of herbs (top secret ;)) four drops neem oil, two drops tea tree, one peppermint, some OSHA, and several more. I leave my mask on for 10-20 mins and any acne black heads or blemish dissipates. Maybe I should patent the mask ha!! Anyhow this is by far the best and most gentle product with awesome results.</li>
    <li> So nice to find an all natural cleanser that really cleanses and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.  Looking forward to trying the moisturizer as well.</li>
    <li> I was previously using avalon organics sensitive skin cleanser.  This cleanser smells somewhat similar, has less ingredients overall, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin quite as much.  I can&#x27;t tolerate cream cleansers, and my skin is a bit sensitive.  This is a really good option for me.  For the time being I will keep using it, but it is pretty expensive for the size of the bottle.  The product is very thick, though, so  i use less than a dime size amount each time.</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter loves this face wash. It lasts forever since you only need a tiny amount and it works great with those rotating facial brushes. This was a re-order and we will continue to purchase this product. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome cleanser. I use it everyday, in the evenings with a washcloth to exfoliate and in the mornings with just my hands. My skin feels fresh and free after using!</li>
    <li> Very good product, my face looks more clear and rejuvenated.</li>
    <li> This clanser cleans  your face very gently and has a neutral smell. I find it a tad expensive even though a little goes a long way. I previously used Sukin foaming facial cleanser and I find that it is more moisturizing than this product. I will probably switch back just because I am hypothyroid and menopausal, so my skin is getting drier by the day! (age 48 in case you were wondering!)</li>
    <li> A little does go a long way. I am trying to be as organic as possible and having skincare regimen to match this quest is a plus. Christina Moss naturals lathers well and rinses clean. No harsh smell, no residue left behind. I use it with the face mositurizer everyday and have noticed a significant change in my skin. No senstitve spots, no oily patches, just nice smooth skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really liking this cleanser so far. It smells lovely and is very gentle. I would recommend it! Also, the customer service is excellent. Very knowledgeable and caring.</li>
    <li> This is the best face wash I have used by far. A little goes a long way and love how smooth and soft it makes my skin feel. Can&#x27;t wait to try their other products as well. I am all about organic natural products. My skin is so much healthier now that I do not use chemicals. Also love the customer service they give in just keeping you updated and making sure you are happy. Not to mention the tips they give.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s expensive but has a nice smell and isn&#x27;t abrasive to your skin while leaving it so fresh n&#x27; so clean.</li>
    <li> Excellent and effective, it never lets your skin dry off. Definitely should try once !!</li>
    <li> I have tried many high end skin care products. None provided the even, non-irritating, and sufficient cleansing and moisture of CMN. At 50+ years old my skin condition can be tumultuous to say the least. Dull, dry in spots, dry all over, oily areas, oily all over, broken out in huge pimples as well as red and itchy - that was the state of my skin on any given day until CMN moisturizer and facial wash came into the picture. All is calm and comfortable now. The products work. The cleanser gently removes dirt without irritation and the moisturizer is quickly and evenly absorbed. I think I&#x27;ve finally realized that I don&#x27;t need all those man made products and wrinkle creams to have great skin. Eating right, exercising, and getting a good night&#x27;s sleep combined with CMN cleanser and moisturizer contribute greatly to this. Both products have pleasant, interesting, mild scents due to the plants utilized in their makeup and not because of any manufactured chemicals or fragrances. I like the way they smell. It brings back a moment of memories for me and the scent dissapates very quickly. The customer service and follow up are unmatched. The products are guaranteed. It is my hope that these products will remain available for a long time to come. Give it a chance. It&#x27;s a distintive experience. Be patient. You&#x27;ll notice the difference.</li>
    <li> Since using this product my face literally has a glow and many have complimented me on my skin. My skin is radiant and youthful and as a mother of two under two not having to wear makeup because your cleanser and moisturizer are doing it&#x27;s job it&#x27;s AMAZING!!!</li>
    <li> I love this! As a senior citizen I&#x27;m always looking for anything that&#x27;ll help retain moisture. This is it. Along with the moisturizer I hit the jackpot.</li>
    <li> I love this product it cleans my face really well and moisturize my face, I first apply the cleanser with warm water and then I splash on as coldest water I can and pat my face dry. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> smells nice and is pleasant to use.  just had a baby and breakouts have been minimal.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product.  It cleans without irritating my face and goes a very long way.  There is no unpleasant odor or &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; to the product.  I recommend it for those with sensitive skin who do not wish to apply unnecessary chemicals to their skin.</li>
    <li> Me and my husband both have been using this face wash for over a month. At least twice a day. And have not used half of the bottle yet. Our skin is clean, he is very pleased with how much it has cleared up his face. When I wash my skin the new pimples that are trying to come to the surface disappear. I am in the process of figuring out which oil as a moisturizer, I like best. I have very sensitive skin so my almond oil broke me out a little bit, but it does not seem like the grape-seed is. I am so glad that this face wash works so well for my skin, or it would be a nightmare the moment :-) I don&#x27;t know if they have other products, Because they have not tried to steer me towards them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beauty tips that have been given are wonderful and work well. Lotion over my make up first, before washing works great ! The emails from Kenny to check on my satisfaction with the product have been appreciated. Lastly I know that the price is up their at $21 a bottle, but I can definitely tell you that you&#x27;re not going to find another product of this Quality for this low of a cost. Also in my search for finding a new face wash I have spent more and not been satisfied with other products. So thank you to Christina Moss Naturals Organic Facial Wash for awesome ingredients and not selling out. Oh, I am 40 with the skin of a teenager :-)</li>
    <li> I waited until I had been using this product for at least a month before reviewing. I am definitely happy with this product overall. The smell is nice, very herbal which comes from the rosemary, I assume. A little bit goes a long way! It does come in a tiny bottle, but I have more than half a bottle left and I wash my face 2-3 times a day, so you only need a pea-sized amount to get clean. It probably wouldn&#x27;t take off heavy make-up, but I use a little bit of light mineral make-up and removes it very well. It&#x27;s hard to say whether it has helped with my acne. It definitely hasn&#x27;t made it any worse, which is great, and it feels like it really gets a fantastic deep clean each time I use it. It is definitely a bit soapy, but it doesn&#x27;t seem super drying. I always follow cleansing with witch hazel toner and some kind of moisturizer, and my moisture balance actually seems better with this cleanser. If I had to say, I would say my acne definitely seems at least calmer, if not all-around better with this cleanser. I like to put it on in the shower and then lay a hot washcloth over my face and let it steam in and then wash it off. Makes my skin baby smooth and soothes any irritation! Definitely keep it away from your eyes though. I haven&#x27;t had a really bad reaction to it of course, I&#x27;ve just noticed that it dries that fragile skin out a bit more than the rest of my face. The customer service is also fantastic. I bought it because of the money back guarantee. The price is a bit steep (but not bad when you think about how long it lasts! 2 months or more per bottle I would guess), but with the money back offer its totally worth a try. I&#x27;m pretty sure this will become my regular cleanser. Nice balance of deep clean and gentle, natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I changed my makeup and started breaking out! And I&#x27;m not kidding but I&#x27;ve only used it for 3 days and since then it has made my skin glow!! I&#x27;ve been using this after using an oil cleanser! And it&#x27;s the best combination! My cheeks have a rossy color! It feels soft!!&#x27; No acne! No dryness! I&#x27;m in love! The smell is smooth! It&#x27;s just perfect! &amp;#60;3 and a little goes a looong way!!</li>
    <li> Great Product and great seller. I highly recommend this purchase.</li>
    <li> Good facial wash. I like the fact that it&#x27;s organice. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
    <li> It cleans well and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.  My face feels clean and fresh.  I have very sensitive skin and finally found a facial wash that performs well.</li>
    <li> Love this face wash!!!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best facial wash I have ever used. I only need a very small drop to wash my face for a fresh, clean feel. It doesn&#x27;t dry my sensitive face while it cleans naturally.  An excellent product.</li>
    <li> First impression, good. However, due to sensitive skin, thought I would use for 2 full weeks. The facial wash didn&#x27;t leave residue and helped control my oily skin. Did have a problem with acne. Small bumps appeared on forehead area. No change in diet or no new medication. Possibly sensitive to ingredients.</li>
    <li> Such a great gentle face wash.  My skin looks pretty good since I started using this wash.  It smells heavenly (if you like lavender, as I do).  My only complain is that the bottle is so small, but a little bit of product goes a long way.  The size of the bottle does not stop me from giving the product 5 stars because it is just that good.</li>
    <li> Horrible experience. I&#x27;ve been looking forward to this face wash. I actually ran out of my old one yesterday. so I figured perfect timing. Unfortunately when I received it this afternoon, it wasn&#x27;t a face wash at all. Just a tiny shampoo. These people aren&#x27;t paying attention to what they&#x27;re even sending. Save yourself a head ache and order it from somewhere else!</li>
    <li> Super foamy. Face feels great after use it. But not that good for my acne.</li>
    <li> I really like this facial wash. It cleans very well and makes your skin feel soft, smooth, firm and never dries your face out. I can definitely see an improvement in the texture of my skin. I also love the fact that this is organic.  Don&#x27;t be put off by the 4oz size....a little goes a long way with this.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Small amount works - Skin feels clean and not tight.  No intense smell, no fragrance, clean &amp; minimal components.  Christina Moss, love your product, love your philosophy.  Great customer service, with free download informational book, and nice your tube videos.</li>
    <li> Want your face to feel really clean and luxurious as you wash it? Try this product! I&#x27;m glad I &amp;#34;found&amp;#34; it and the moisturizer. I&#x27;ve tried many such products, but I&#x27;m sold on this one!</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer. As somebody who has never used the same facial cleanser twice, I think I could stick to this one. The organic, natural ingredients are clean and smells natural with no artificial perfumes.</li>
    <li> I love using this with my Clarisonic. Is gentle, works great, and lasts a long time. It doesn&#x27;t take much at all to get your face soft and clean!</li>
    <li> Love this product!!! Makes my face feel so refreshing and I have very sensitive skin and I have had no problems!</li>
    <li> Totally different clean feeling to your face after using this versus normal soapy cleansers which&lt;br /&gt;usually leaves my face feeling slightly oily still. I also liked the subtle natural fragrance,</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot and will purchase it again. My skin isn&#x27;t dry or oily,my face is soft, feels clean and it removes all my makeup. I was out of shaving lotion so I used a little of this as a replacement.  I got a close shave and it left my legs softer than the shaving lotion does. Definitely  worth the extra money for organic and works better.</li>
    <li> Been using for a couple of weeks. I don&#x27;t have much to say, I&#x27;m happy to use something that is all natural ingredients, however I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in skin, in fact my face is completely shiny all the time now, and a tad bit &amp;#34;over greased&amp;#34;. I haven&#x27;t felt this clean &amp;#34;spectacular&amp;#34; feeling that I read from the reviews. Its probably me - I knew it was too good to be true to finally find face products that worked.</li>
    <li> Great product! I have acne prone skin and wasn&#x27;t sure this would work for me. I was pleasantly surprised with the results. If you&#x27;re looking for an organic cleanser that works, this is the one! You won&#x27;t be disappointed:)</li>
    <li> This is the best face wash I have ever used. It makes my face feel so clean and it has a really nice scent too. Worth every dollar :)</li>
    <li> So late posting review! I love this wash. Does not hurt my eyes and it really does get all the makeup off. Very pleasant facial wash! I use it with the konjac sponge every night and every morning. My skin looks great. I am 40...so this is not so easy to do anymore :)</li>
    <li> I really like the cleanser...my face feels clean and my pores are tight.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  Cleans gently without leaving my skin dry, has kept my skin looking beautiful but best of all it smells absolutely amazing.  It&#x27;s delicious.  The rosemary is perfect after a long day when I&#x27;m tired.  I enjoy washing my face and look forward to it with this product.  Amazing.</li>
    <li> I bought this cleanser and the CM shampoo and conditioner after trying 15-16 other products that would not aggravate a stubborn case of rosacea. They smell delightful, the customer service in answering my questions and following up, including offering other tips, was unbelievable, and have been using them for 3 weeks with no problems with flare ups. Highly recommend, and sub customer service is rare today.</li>
    <li> This is just amazing. Literally amazing. Wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to get it because its a little pricey , but it&#x27;s so worth it. Your face feels so much better and is so much cleaner. Haven&#x27;t had a breakout.</li>
    <li> This is the best facial wash I&#x27;ve ever used. A little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve had it now for a few months, and I&#x27;m not even close to needing another bottle just yet. I have adult cystic acne on my chin. Using this facial wash along with the Christina moss moisturizer has really helped with the inflammation and number of breakouts I get. Now, I still get the usual &amp;#34;time of the month&amp;#34; breakout, but I can tell that using this cleanser and the accompanying moisturizer makes the breakout less extreme than normal. I also use Dickenson&#x27;s witch hazel toner in between. This regimen has really helped with my acne. Thank goodness, too, because I have spent thousands of dollars over the past 5 years trying to find something that works. The best part is, there are no harmful ingredients. It&#x27;s a win-win purchase. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> natural, very lightly scented, clean fresh feeling afterward. keeps my skin moist but not oily. i use it every night as part of my bedtime routine to remove makeup (it does!) and put on toner and lotion afterward. But on nights I&#x27;m lazy i just use this and it feels great. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Thank you very much for making it possible to enjoy chemical-free quality products. We all appreciate what you do!</li>
    <li> Excellent. I really recommended. My face keep fresh and clean. It not dry my face!</li>
    <li> My face feels squeaky clean with the facial wash.  I will definitely order the facial wash and moisturizer again.  Thank you Christina Moss for your excellent products.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this product for several months and really likes it.</li>
    <li> Listen to me! Why? because I am one of those people who spends a lot of $$ on products that WORK for my skin, specifically my face.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve probably tried all of the expensive brands on the market. I have to give this product my complete stamp of approval because it works for ALL skin types, is natural and doesn&#x27;t cost and arm &amp; a leg. Yay!!</li>
    <li> We purchased this for my 10 year old daughter who has recently broke out in acne on her forehead. It seems to be helping, but she&#x27;s only used it a few times, so it&#x27;s hard to tell just yet!</li>
    <li> The thing I love about this cleanser is that it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling dry after I use it. It must be the chemicals they use in the other cleansers that leave your face feeling like its been stripped after washing and begging for lotion to be slathered on. This cleanser leaves your face clean and refreshed.</li>
    <li> Just for a reference point, I am a black woman, and at almost 50 this year, I can tell you that I didn&#x27;t start getting zits until the age of 40.  I&#x27;ve tried Proactiv, which made my skin worse, and I&#x27;ve tried just about every other brand out there, but to no avail.  I&#x27;ve been using this facial wash in combination with their moisturizer for about 3 months now, and am quite pleased with it.  A little goes a long way so I don&#x27;t have to reorder the facial wash quite yet.  It&#x27;s a refreshing clean, but I wish it handled blackheads in the nose area.  For some reason, it is not addressing that.  But my skin,overall, is looking so much better.  Update: 1/17/2016 I re-ordered because this stuff is great for my skin!!!  The company is totally awesome.  I had a coupon to apply and it had expired.  I contacted the company to explain that it had no expiration date, and they sent me a new coupon code.  This company truly rocks!!!</li>
    <li> I love it! You only need a very small amount to clean your face and it&#x27;s good to know it&#x27;s without all those Chemicals!</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my face feel clean after.</li>
    <li> Love this product! We will be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> This is seriously the best facial wash ever! I have hardly any outbreaks and when I do they are very small and hardly noticeable. I&#x27;ve had so many compliments on how great my skin looks now. I also switched my makeup to Alima pure and it blows bare minerals away if any ladies are looking to switch.</li>
    <li> ok, so I&#x27;ve tried this again and decided to update my review. I never really take time to post any review for whatsoever, but when something is good, you have to say it&#x27;s good. My daughter had a huge mosquito bite on her face and I told her to try the face wash, she&#x27;s 13 and only used the wash just that one afternoon. The next morning the bite disappeared, normally the mosquito bite last them for days. I was so shocked. So I said I will try the wash on myself again. I tried to use it only once a day, I have oily skin, but after using it my skin feels dry, but it does the job. I also use the organic facial moisturizer and I must tell you that  I&#x27;m 40 and I have adult acne and I can see great improvement while using these two products.&lt;br /&gt;Also to my very surprise, the CEO emailed and told me that I could return the product and apologized because I had the reaction the first time. Most people care about their money. These people show that they truly care about customers. I&#x27;m glad I gave the product another try. I think after using so much product that have chemicals and suddenly switched to organics that was probably what made me had that reaction. But I&#x27;m SO HAPPY I tried again and you should to, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with this line. I purchased the shampoo and conditioner for my 3yr old and after a long search to find something that didn&#x27;t dry her hair out but she also didn&#x27;t break out in a rash from, I am relieved that the search is over. So I decided to splurge for myself and try out their facial wash. My face feels clean but remains so soft after use. The scent is mild and pleasant. And very little goes a long way. Yes it is a small bottle, but only about a pea size is necessary to wash my face. Highly recommend this line of body care The customer service is excellent and its a win-win because either you will love the product and keep it or you can return for a full refund. What&#x27;s there to lose?</li>
    <li> i have been searching for a natural face wash for a little while but wasn&#x27;t impressed by what i was finding for the price. i LOVE this stuff!  it felt a little drying just at first while my skin adjusted (presumably because my skin was used to so much artificial stuff) but now that i&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks, it really couldn&#x27;t be more perfect. and such a value - the bottle is small but you literally need a large drop (the size of a pencil eraser) to get a huge lather all over your whole face. i will never go back to regular cleanser!</li>
    <li> I  have had excellent results from this product, it took about 12 days for it to work on my skin, I initially contacted Kenny, the  C.E.O. Who told me to be patient while the toxins from other products cleared from my body. My skin is smooth, clear, and I&#x27;m satisfied that I am not putting any harsh chemicals on my face, parabens, or other &amp;#34;nasties&amp;#34;. Together with the moisturizer, these products have been re-ordered.&lt;br /&gt;Do give a new product time to work, as Kenny said to me, you my not see overnight results.&lt;br /&gt;The facial has a distinctly aromatic &amp;#34;herb&amp;#34; smell, which I like. I also carry a small container of facial wash (and moisturizer) with me in case I want to clean my face. A small pharmacy pill bottle or dollar store packet of containers with lids are half the size).</li>
    <li> My face feels so soft after using this product for a couple weeks, morning and night! It smells amazing too. Remember, a little goes a long way! It lathers, which I love, and is easy to rinse off. My face hasn&#x27;t felt tight once since using this product! (And I have very sensitive skin) I will be purchasing again when I run out!</li>
    <li> I like it, and the size fits in my medicine cabinet-not a big clunker.  My skin feels clean, but not stripped.</li>
    <li> Nice smell and quality. Small bottle but you only need a tiny amount to wash your face.</li>
    <li> Very nice smelling and mild face wash. Light lather. Doesn&#x27;t burn at all. I seriously love this face wash.</li>
    <li> Very good product and it works very well with the moisturizer also, I honestly think I have found a product that works very well with my skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple weeks now and I absolutely love it! It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, it&#x27;s non-irritating, and my skin looks and feels healthier! I will definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel like there is any make up residue  left on my face after using this product.  A very little goes a long way. The fragrance is great!&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> just an ok product  nothing special dont waste money -----not happy with the products planing to return it back ,</li>
    <li> nothing seems to be good with this product. my face is not at all acne free nor it makes feel fresh or effective. i thought it gonna make my skin cells active which boost skin color but all wrong. after using this product i got more grey hair in my beard.</li>
    <li> Great product. Smells nice, feels nice, doesn&#x27;t make my face dry or oily, and the ingredients seem good. I just think it&#x27;s very expensive, or I&#x27;d give it 5 stars. I hope I can find a sale or they realize that most people won&#x27;t be able to afford it. I won&#x27;t buy again unless I get a coupon or something.</li>
    <li> The earthy smell was a little different (rosemary) but I love the product! Very refreshing on my skin.</li>
    <li> I wanted to use this stuff for at least a month before giving a fair review. This face wash has single handedly transformed my skin. No more breakouts, faded my acne scars and hyperpigmentation, minimized my pores, and has given my skin a smooth, flawless texture. I almost can&#x27;t believe it but this one product has given my skin a new, healthy, soft focus glow. I know it&#x27;s kinda expensive for a little 4 oz bottle but you really only need a pea sized amount to get the job done and your face is left feeling squeaky clean and baby soft, not that stripped feeling that so many acne washes leave. It&#x27;s truly a miracle product and when I run out 6 months from now, I will no doubt be repurchasing. I really can&#x27;t thank Christina Moss Naturals enough!</li>
    <li> Love this Face Wash! My skin feels very fresh and clean and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;MG</li>
    <li> This was an horrible product, it made my pimple worst and the smell was horrible. I had to return the product through amazon because their website is non responsive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this product.  It takes just a small amount, is gentle on my sensitive skin, has just the slightest pleasant fragrance and my skin feels good afterward.  I will definitely order more when the time comes.</li>
    <li> This face wash is pretty awesome. I have had it for a couple of weeks so far and I have definitely noticed a difference in my skin. It even balanced out my menstrual break outs pretty well. You get the bang for your buck since the solution is highly concentrated, so only a dime sized amount is needed for one wash. I recommend using a face brush with this wash since it is not a scrub for better results. (Even if you don&#x27;t have one of those expensive spin brushes, I use a manual one and it&#x27;s the same for me)  Customer service is also way on top of it. It&#x27;s quite refreshing actually. They check in on you like a week after you purchased your product to make sure that you are truly enjoying their product. It&#x27;s a small bottle but I&#x27;m hardly a quarter through it, and I was twice a day, once in the morning before my make up routine and once right before bed. Also, give it some time to take effect. you have to give you skin time to adapt to this wash and clear it&#x27;s system from whatever wash you were using before, especially if it was chemical. If you are looking to go organic, this is definitely a good buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this facial wash for a couple of weeks now.  I have sensitive skin and I am trying to use more natural products.  The smell of this is pleasant, not too strong and it washes off my make-up well.  I use it daily and it leaves my skin feeling soft.  It is a small bottle but I believe it will last quite a while since I only need one small drop to wash my entire face.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good cleanser.  I&#x27;ve used others along with it, but I like the feeling that it is getting all my makeup off with no offensive scent.</li>
    <li> This leaves my skin so clear, I love it. I thought it was a little drying at first but it hasn&#x27;t affected my skin in any way but positive.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash. It doesn&#x27;t really have a smell, it washes without over drying and is overall a great product.</li>
    <li> My only complaint here is the price, but it takes so little of it, that&#x27;s almost a moot point. It is a very good cleanser. It is clearly marketed toward women, but it use it on my face and shaved head after work every day, and I love how my skin feels! The smell is neutral and subtle, and I like that it is organic and made by a small company.</li>
    <li> This face wash leaves your skin feeling and looking beautiful without drying it out. I love that each bottle is made fresh when you order it and the company pays extra attention to their customers and their satisfaction with the product. I recommend this to anyone and all skin types!</li>
    <li> Great product. Delivered promptly too.&lt;br /&gt;My whole family uses this - myself and my two young kids.&lt;br /&gt;We use it to remove sunscreen and it does a great job!</li>
    <li> I am hyper-allergic to many products and this one has worked well for me. This is my second order of this cleanser.</li>
    <li> Sometimes it seems like it makes my face break out more.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash! No chemicals, dyes, parabens and it lasts for a long time. A little goes a long way with this stuff and it is worth every penny! It does not leave any residue and you&#x27;re face feels clean and refreshed after.</li>
    <li> I use almost all range of Christina Moss products. And initially I started Facial Wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like:&lt;br /&gt;- ingredients are absolutely easy to understand (finally!);&lt;br /&gt;- you need very small amount of it even if you have a very oily skin as I (I mean really oily!!);&lt;br /&gt;- skin feels clean after it;&lt;br /&gt;- bottle is compact so it&#x27;s easy to grab for traveling.</li>
    <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve used that actually cleans your face with a minimal amount.  I really like this and it is super concentrated, so you need very little to do the job.  Their customer service is awesome, I base my thoughts on whether or not I will buy from a company by their customer service.  I highly recommend Christina Moss Naturals products.  Thank you for caring.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a week and love it!  My skin looks much healthier since I using it!  I only buy natural things with no chemicals which is why I thought I would try this and am so glad I did!</li>
    <li> Thank You making an all natural face wash that has really helped me clear up! The other face washes like Clinique are too expensive and they do help but only if one keeps using them. This product has really helped me and I look forward to buying the bundle soon. Thank You!</li>
    <li> I like this facial wash, I feel clean but not dry after I use it. I&#x27;ve noticed the little white bumps on my chin and forehead dissappearing which is good and I attribute it to this wash, but I&#x27;m breaking out with more cystic type blemishes on my lower cheeks and and chin a lot more than I did before using this. Not sure what to think. I&#x27;ve been using for about 2 weeks now.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!  The scent was a bit overwhelming at first but don&#x27;t let that deter you. I use this on the daily and will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> For years I had been using an organic cleanser for my dry skin.  I live in a desert climate and although my old cleanser was cream based and mild and moisturizing, it did not do much for cleaning my skin thoroughly, especially when getting rid of the residue of my make up.  Christina Moss&#x27; facial cleanser not only cleaned my face entirely in ONE wash, I didn&#x27;t have that parched felling you get after washing your face with non cream based cleansers.  In addition, typically there is a transition period that is my skin experiences whenever I switch facial products.  I try to give myself a month to see if the product really works.  Christina Moss&#x27; facial cleanser worked immediately with not one day of break outs.  This is my new facial cleanser I absolutely love this cleanser and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and it works very well for me. I have combination to oily skin. I bought another bottle to use as a body wash. After use, I only need a light moisturizer on my face, and little to no lotion on my body. Before using this product, I used to use a lot of lotion on both my face and body to avoid getting dry patches, but I no longer need to do that. I definitely recommend this product as both a face and body wash.</li>
    <li> Positives: the smell and that it&#x27;s organic/natural&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I think I&#x27;m allergic to some ingredient in this cleanser. The first night I used the cleanser, my skin tingled. I didn&#x27;t think much of it - I figured that it&#x27;s just the natural ingredients causing the tingling. The second night I used this product, my skin had a burning sensation. I decided to try it one more time, and so the third night of trying this cleanser, I decided I&#x27;m allergic to something. My skin burned a lot and my skin got PUFFY. My eye lids puffed up and my face skin turned red and puffy. So I&#x27;m definitely not trying this again. This cleanser also dried my skin. I already have dry skin problems, and the fact that my skin dried up even more was not good to see. I&#x27;m glad to see that this works for some people though.</li>
    <li> Our dermatologist had suggested our son use Cetaphil Oil Control Foam Wash as his cleanser.  After using it for several months, he started having breakouts again.  I decided to look for something that was all natural to see if that helped.  He&#x27;s been using this facial wash for a few months and he only has occasional acne now.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this cleanser.</li>
    <li> Acne be gone! I have bad acne .. As I am a teenage guy. I use this every night after I shower, I put on the facial wash, then add moisturizer , and bam in the morning my acne lessens greatly. I bought the moisturizer too from same brand, but it&#x27;s just OK for me, but the facial wash is life changing.</li>
    <li> Great product! My skin is very sensitive and most face washes irritate my skin. This face wash has given me no problems and left me with clean clear skin. Love it!</li>
    <li> Great product.  I was surprised when it came because the bottle was small but you only need a small amount. Lathers good and my face feels clean. I love that I can use an organic product.</li>
    <li> repeat user. great product. doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> Have used this wash for last 2 years ... love it</li>
    <li> My skin hates probably 99% of the washes I use. In the past I thought my skin was tolerating a product, only to breakout everywhere before the end of the day. I&#x27;ve used this wash for a week, and my acne is probably 60% cleared. I haven&#x27;t had a clear face in 2 years. I&#x27;m assuming this is because of the organic and simple nature of the product. My body is thanking me. It smells decent and really cleans my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a note to newbies. You&#x27;ll probably need some sort of moisturizer to balance out of the drying nature of the product. I personally use Almond Oil because I like it simple, but I&#x27;m sure that the Christina Moss moisturizer works as well as this one does. It&#x27;s pricey, but I&#x27;ve spent around $200 in the last year trying out products. I&#x27;m ok with sticking with one that works for only $20 every 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note* Since using this wash, bees tend to flock around my face. They really dig the smell I&#x27;m guessing.</li>
    <li> Mine is combination skin and my cheeks dried out a little for the first two days. Gradually, I did not notice the dry out and the best part is it feels very soft after the wash. My cheeks used to dry out when I was using very well known brand. I am very very happy with the face wash. I like the smell too, in fact when I reach home I feel excited to wash my face. I am happy that I found this product. Thank you for making the product for us!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this cleanser for the face. My face is clearer then before and the blackheads that have been persistent on my nose for years are becoming less noticeable after just a couple weeks. For me it has a nice minty scent that does not linger. l will be ordering again,</li>
    <li> I have acne-prone, combination, and sensitive skin. I have been searching for a facial cleanser that wouldn&#x27;t dry out my skin and this is the only product that delivered. I do weekly chemical peels to keep my acne in check but it also dries it out. Every other natural and organic cleanser I have tried left me dry and itchy, but this cleanser left my skin so soft and clean. It removed my makeup well enough, though sometimes I had to do another wash to get it all off. I gave it four stars because it is expensive and not economical for me to continue using at this moment.</li>
    <li> I have been a nutritarian for over a year.  Dr. Furhman&#x27;s program does work.  However, I wasn&#x27;t really happy with my complexion.  I bought a Clarisonic but my face still didn&#x27;t look like I was feeling on the inside after all that hard work.  Then it dawned on me:  I found I was having bad reactions to preservatives in food so I stopped eating them.  But I was still smearing them on my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just won&#x27;t do that now.  This cleanser is changing my skin after a couple of weeks.  I hope I can always have it.</li>
    <li> Nice, clean feeling without the chemicals. Like the peace of mind knowing I&#x27;m not damaging or harming my skin. Smells nice. A little goes a long way and even though it doesn&#x27;t have the usual foaming agents that drug store face washes have it still lathers up a little.</li>
    <li> The smell is amazing! Just a pea size amount will clean your face. Cleans without stripping. Very happy to have found this company and it&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> Love this facial wash!!  It&#x27;s a small bottle but definitely worth the price.  I only use a drop to wash my face so this bottle will go a long way and its organic and natural.</li>
    <li> Does a good job cleansing but I don&#x27;t care for the licorice/anise scent.</li>
    <li> What a great product! I can tell that this is a great quality product by the way my face looks since I have been using it! I will definitely be making another order so I don&#x27;t run out.... You can tell that it is organic and has a good smell to it too.</li>
    <li> excellent product! Not harsh but leaves face feeling fresh and clean. The switch from a different product  was seamless and I&#x27;m appreciative of the all natural ingredient list. Also, I need very little to wash my face.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  It cleans very well and leaves your face soft.  Doesn&#x27;t take much to work up a good lather and smells like Bergamot.</li>
    <li> The best facial wash I have ever used. Skin is soft and never tight. I love this stuff. I get anxiety when I realize I am running low! I typically get the two or three major cystic acne type breakouts (I&#x27;m 34) and for the past three months of using, only had one on my chin- and it was much smaller and lasted for a shorter amount of time. I do use it with a rotating scrub brush, so I&#x27;m not sure how much more of an impact that has- but either way I love this product and will continue to order.</li>
    <li> I had a problem using this product as the entire list of ingredients was not on the website. I have a severe allergic reaction to chemicals so I was not able to use this cleanser. When I was shopping I didn&#x27;t notice the cleanser is 100% natural, not organic. If you don&#x27;t need a 100% organic product then you will probably love this. It was delivered on time and customer service is excellent.</li>
    <li> OMG, I am sooooooo glad that I found this product. I have been searching for a natural product for my face for nearly 2 years and this is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle IS small, however you only need a tiny bit as it does foam up nicely and when it foams there is enough for your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using Christina Moss&#x27; products I have seen a noticeable difference in my face.  I have furrow lines on my forehead, from too many years staring at a computer screen and working on spreadsheets (a sign of concentration lol).  Anyway these furrow lines have all but disappeared.  They are still there don&#x27;t get me wrong, but the appearance on them from looking at my forehead you can hardly see them.  Very impressed with this and now a customer for life.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Like the instructions say, you don&#x27;t have to use much of this at all. I like the fragrance, it&#x27;s not too strong. I didn&#x27;t have the normal &amp;#34;break out&amp;#34; when using a new product. I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3-4 weeks, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> I was in the hunt for a new face wash. I have used boscia purifying cleansing gel and l&#x27;occitane&#x27;s Shea cleansing milk. Both have worked well for me but my biggest gripe was availability and dispensing method.  Both are only available on specialty stores or have a crazy expensive shipping cost to Hawaii online.  So I turned to the ever dependable Amazon for free shipping and reviews I can base my purchase on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s start with availability.  Amazon&#x27;s free shipping can&#x27;t be beat.  The seller easy returns and guarantee gave me a sense of safety that if I didn&#x27;t like the product I can return it and get my money back.  Super fast shipping too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for ease of use, the bottle looks quite small,  easy push to dispense.  Easy peazy. My biggest gripe from the face washes I&#x27;ve used before is the bottle is still 1/5 full and the pumps don&#x27;t work anymore.  So I just throw it out and waste so much product. I don&#x27;t foresee this problem with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The face wash itself is a pretty thick liquid,  I kinda was surprised how small it was,  but it is so true that a little goes a loooooong way.  Squeeze out only a dime size per use,  maybe a nickel when I use my clarisonic. But it&#x27;s pretty sudsy, has a nice mild scent to it (lavender maybe? ) it washes well, does not leave oily residue or strip my face bare, but left my face feeling clean.  I have also tried it with waterproof mascara and it did remove it. I also use it when I shave my legs, because it creates very thick suds. Works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I think I found myself a keeper.  Thank you again Amazon for helping a girl out and kudos to the seller for a great product.  5 stars and highly recommended. I will certainly purchase it again. Now I&#x27;m thinking of trying out their moisturizer.... (wink-wink)</li>
    <li> This facial wash works great and isnt harsh/ doesnt dry out your skin. It smells good too and you only need a tiny bit.</li>
    <li> Love washing my face with this everyday. Like that there are no bad chemicals and it is all natural! Remember, a little goes along way</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry at the end of my shower. Nice essential oil smell (Rosemary).</li>
    <li> amazing best face wash ever</li>
    <li> amazing product. i want to start with the pros and cons......well it&#x27;s more of a personal complaint. and it&#x27;s only one complaint..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My personal and only complaint is... The bottle is a LOT smaller than i anticipated. if you look at the pictures, it looks...kinda of big....but it&#x27;s not its really small. i wish they would make it more obvious that it was smaller. Or maybe offer a bigger size to buy? i wouldn&#x27;t mind playing a little more for a bigger size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the good! this bottle is amazing! i work with trash and unfortunately all that trash and dirt just fly&#x27;s onto my face.....yeah sucks i know. But i know i&#x27;m safe cuz i got my baby waiting for me! this bottle just works wonders on my face . the smell (at first) was a little strange, but i got used to it. Now remember when i said that the bottle was small? well you don&#x27;t have to worry about that, because this bottle will last you 5 years! yes 5 years!.......nah i&#x27;m playing, but this bottle will definitely last you a couple of months. now i been using this product for about 5 days, but i can tell and say that this bottle will last me a couple of months. so u don&#x27;t have to worry about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a great product with NO harmful chemicals. which i love cuz my last cleanser had some chemicals that i didn&#x27;t like. i also felt like it was breaking me out. anyway great product.</li>
    <li> This organic wash is excellent!  It actually cleans my face without making it feel too dry.  And it&#x27;s organic!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! The best way to be helpful to anyone who is on the fence...I get nasty hair bumps and literally have to go in and do surgery on the bump to get the hair to come out to decrease the inflammation.  I know I shouldn&#x27;t! I washed my face with the cleanser and applied the facial moisturizer and lo and behold not only was the the inflammation was gone from the hair bump, but hair was no longer trapped...this was all in one day. I fell in love in that moment.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin but helped clear my acne. Definitely will buy again:)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year and have noticed a lot clearer skin! 1 bottle lasts 3-4 months</li>
    <li> This face wash is fantastic, I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months now! I used to use the orange lóreal face wash, that left my face super dry. This face wash doesn&#x27;t leave my face dry, plus doesn&#x27;t have all those chemicals in it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this face wash has helped with my acne a little bit, but not a whole lot. However, I would still recommend this face wash! I&#x27;m going to keep using it!</li>
    <li> Wow this facial cleanser is FANTASTIC. My whole life my skin has been &amp;#34;very sensitive&amp;#34; to any high chemical or scented product, it was next to impossible to find a good facial cleanser that didn&#x27;t irritate my skin and this one is the best. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out, it gets rid of severe acne, oily skin, (smells like eculyptus thats in bath salts) but it&#x27;s a very mild scent, doesn&#x27;t irritate it. Pores shrink down fast and redness fades away. There is a small problem the bottle is only like 3-4 inches in length so use only a few drops when applying after rubbing it in your hands. I feel incredible after each use and will continue to buy this facial wash again. THANK YOU SOOOOO MUCH CHRISTINA MOSS!!!!!! I LOVE YOU lol  P.S. YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH YOUR PRODUCTS MEANS TO ME. Thank you for taking the time to think about us.</li>
    <li> My cousin swears by this face wash and has been using it for a long time , I am looking forward to it because christina moss products are good</li>
    <li> Leaves my face dewey and soft, doesn&#x27;t leave me with tight, dried out skin that breaks out the next day.  My skin is very sensitive and I am allergic to so many things, so this was a wonderful find.  I use it in conjunction with the exfoliator that CMN sells, I recommend that as well.  I have issues with acne and I can tame them with this face wash.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This face wash is excellent. I am very particular about what I use on my skin and this product has made my complexion radiant and evened out my skin tone. It is suitable for sensitive skin and smells lovely. It is concentrated and should be used sparingly. This line also makes a great moisturizer. I use that as well. Once again use sparingly because it is very emollient. Since I&#x27;ve been using these products I have gotten numerous compliments on my complexion and rarely wear make-up. Thank you for making an organic product that is so effective.</li>
    <li> Have not had this very long, couple of days, but so far I like it.  You only need a very small amount and it seems to do a good job of cleaning.  I tried it because it is organic an so far it has worked as promised.  I do like this product.  It doesn&#x27;t dry my face but cleanses well and a little bit goes a long way.  I think too because it has only organic ingredients it is much better for your skin.  I now have been using this product for over a month.  It is a great product!  It cleans my face leaving it feeling fresh not dry.  Normally I do not have a lot of face blemishes but this cleared the one that popped up within a couple of days.  I will continue to use Facial Wash, it does a very good job.</li>
    <li> I really like this face wash. It cleans well and makes my skin feel smooth and firm. I can definitely see an improvement in the texture and plan to continue using it.</li>
    <li> Wow!  This is an excellent product. Very concentrated so no need being nervous about the price. It cleans my face without the &#x27;dry&#x27; I usually get from other cleansers. I have their moisturizer too and am very pleased with it as well!</li>
    <li> It has a very pleasant smell and it feels nice while I wash my face. It lather&#x27;s nicely and leaves my skin smooth and moisturized.</li>
    <li> The best facial wash on earth.... Great for people suffering from acne...</li>
    <li> I love this product and seller.  I was looking for a sulfate-free face wash, and this product is wonderful at cleansing and makeup removal, but also gentle to the skin.  The seller is great.  I&#x27;ve always gotten my orders on time with no issues.</li>
    <li> Worth the price. Organic and natural, leaves skin feeling clean. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> I am an esthetician so I have tried many products. I have dry skin with some oily spots and am probed to black heads. This cleanser worked great for me. Kept breakouts away without making me feel too oily or too dry like most products.</li>
    <li> I love this facial wash, it leaves my skin feeling thoroughly cleansed and not dry and I love the smell.  I think this company has put a lot of effort into making products that are truly organic and non -damaging to the skin.</li>
    <li> Wanted to love it but it made my face break out:(</li>
    <li> So far excellent product. I use with my face scrubber &amp; it causes no breakouts.  My skin feels soft, smooth &amp; non drying. It is a very small container for the price, but I only need to use a drop</li>
    <li> The bottle is small, and let me tell you why. This product is concentrated! You only need less than a dime size to cover your whole face. So it will last you a while. I use this with my clarisonic mia 2 and it suds up pretty well. It cleans well, it&#x27;s not overly scented, and it has clean, narural ingredients. Can&#x27;t get better than that. I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month, and although my face isn&#x27;t completely clear yet, I do see improvement in my skin. I also have the facial toner and moisturizer, all of which I recommend.</li>
    <li> I am 35 and feel like I have always suffered from acne. It&#x27;s one thing to have it as a teenager, but completely different to have it as an adult and feel like nothing works for you. I have my own microdermabrasion machine, but even that didn&#x27;t work well to rid my face of acne. I&#x27;ve been on Retin A since my teen years and I&#x27;ve had numerous acid peels. When I read these reviews, I though there was no way it really worked that well. Let me just say that this face wash has been a miracle for me!!! I&#x27;ve been using it for 2-3 months and I&#x27;ve only had a couple of zits. I didn&#x27;t even breakout during my menstrual cycles. My face feels so smoothe. A lady in yoga even told me I had pretty skin. What?!? No one has ever said that to me. I love that it is organic and not full of toxic chemicals. I do use the lotion as well, which I love.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this facial.wash! I only use all natural products and i was finding it difficult to find something for my face so i ended up using a body wash on my face  and my skin was getting very dry and I was getting blackheads on my nose and forehead. I&#x27;ve been using this wash for 2 weeks now and the blackheads are gone and my skin is starting to go back to normal.. And they are right when they say you only need a tiny amount. The amount I use isn&#x27;t even a dime size drop I don&#x27;t think.  Even though it&#x27;s a bit expensive, I think it&#x27;s worth the money. I am so glad I found this wash. I will definitely order again.  Update, I&#x27;m still completely head over heels about this facial cleanser. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year now and I love it just as much. I ran out of it before I could order a new bottle about a month ago and I had to use a different cleanser for a week or so and I noticed a change in my skin right away. This cleanser is so gentle and forgiving on my sensitive skin. I only wish they would come out with a moisturizer in the same fragrance!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my granddaughter and she loves it.  Thank you for the fast shipping as well.</li>
    <li> I love this Facial Wash.  It makes my face look and feel so very nice.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This facial wash is awesome.  My skin feels very clean but not too dry.  It is also very concentrated so you need just a little to get the job done.  I give this 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I will never buy another face wash ever again. This stuff is magic and I especially live that it is all natural, organic ingredients! That makes all the difference! It&#x27;s pricey but not when you consider how long this will last you - you only need a 1/4 teaspoon size to work into your whole face and neck... Great great buy!</li>
    <li> Best cleanser I ever used hands down.  It&#x27;s so mild that I can use twice a day which never happens and it really works.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I have a long history of trying cleansers that either dry out my face or make it oily. This does neither of those irritating things to my face. And I haven&#x27;t broken out from using it so I feel very good about my purchase.</li>
    <li> NOT TESTED ON ANIMALS.  This is a wonderful face wash.  I have sensitive skin, and have had NO problems.  It cleans thoroughly, without drying, and it only takes a tiny drop.  Very highly concentrated.  If you use two drops, you&#x27;ll be washing lots of things beside your face.</li>
    <li> This face wash has been so far so good...the only thing I didn&#x27;t like is how tiny the moisturizer is. They should really be the same size in all fairness</li>
    <li> Love this organic facial wash and the smell. You only need to a little bit of it and it lather wells onto your face. Will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> Leaves face feeling good and clean. There&#x27;s a pleasant smell, too, very subtle. It&#x27;s hasn&#x27;t completely cleared my acne, but it does seem to be helping!</li>
