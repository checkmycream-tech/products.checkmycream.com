      <li>Love it, keeps my roots from showing</li>
      <li>Works fantastic!</li>
      <li>My hair is full but very fine.</li>
      <li>You have to go easy on it though because it does add quite a bit of texture to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It can make your scalp feel greasy more quickly.</li>
      <li>I use it in between color appointments and find that it does a fantastic job covering my gray.</li>
      <li>I works great to hide the grey.</li>
      <li>Great, covers my grey!</li>
      <li>I love this product  and highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Like the product very much, it really creates the illusion of hair and easy to apply, however, it floats everywhere onto wall and mirrors and comes off on pillows</li>
      <li>Great product for those days that your hair needs a little help.</li>

      <li>Anyway, this product is light and no harsh smell.  </li>

      <li>I am very gray and use the spray powder on my hair part for coverage.&lt;br /&gt;Washes out on each shampoo.</li>
      <li>The spray nozzle didnt work very well at all.</li>
      <li>It made my hair feel like I had sprayed a whole can of hair spray on it.</li>
      <li>Same exact problem.</li>
      <li>Fantastic for hiding bald spots with dark hair.</li>
      <li>so i thought maybe the spray issue was fixed.</li>
      <li>A year later I saw it had new packaging</li>
      <li>lot of people seem to ask how dark it is for their shade of hair...which is pretty subjective to me.</li>
      <li>This hair powder is slightly lighter than my hair color...but not to the point that it is noticeable unless I put a whole bunch on....</li>

<li> This hair powder is slightly lighter than my hair color...but not to the point that it is noticeable unless I put a whole bunch on....</li>
<li> Makes me appear to have a full head of hair instead of thin hair.</li>
<li> Works okay, but expensive compared to other brands of hair powder,</li>
<li> Lasts a long time.  </li>
<li> Save money and the damage to your hair if your just starting to grey or if your mike me, and just have some minimal greying at the root and don&#x27;t eantot over use dyes and elongate the between factor between the processing.  </li>
<li> Too expensive for what it is worth!</li>
<li> Only need to spray a little to do the trick.</li>
<li> Gives body and coverage to pink scalp.</li>
<li> I also have dark, curly hair that likes to clump together and show other places on my scalp.</li>
<li> Here is a photo of my color of hair, which I consider dark brown.</li>
<li> then it just appears to make my hair color less shiny and a little &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; in color.</li>
<li> Sprayed unevenly and dripped.</li>
<li> I submitted a request to replace it but no response for at least 2 weeks.</li>
<li> Not happy at all.</li>
<li> Whatever has changed to the product, besides the &amp;#34;new packaging&amp;#34;, has rendered it useless for coverage purposes.  </li>
<li> She thought it was expensive.  </li>
<li> Definitely disappointed.  </li>

    <li> I use this between may hair dye visits. I works great to hide the grey. The only drawback is if I exercise after I&#x27;ve applied it, it tends to run. Otherwise it works well.</li>
    <li> Bought for my Mom and she was very happy with it.  She thought it was expensive.  She would give it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I use this everytime I wash my hair!  Makes me appear to have a full head of hair instead of thin hair. Gives body and coverage to pink scalp. My favorite product!!!</li>
    <li> This product works great to hide my  balding areas on head</li>
    <li> This came off on my clothing and my hands.  It made my hair feel like I had sprayed a whole can of hair spray on it.</li>
    <li> Fantastic for hiding bald spots with dark hair. Holds up great on the scalp. So glad to have found this product!!</li>
    <li> Great, covers my grey!</li>
    <li> Excellent cover up for grays.  Lasts a long time.  This is the only one I buy.</li>
    <li> Great coverage in between dye jobs.  Its a life saver.</li>
    <li> Love it, keeps my roots from showing</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely awesome! I use it in between color appointments and find that it does a fantastic job covering my gray. I love this product  and highly recommend it. It doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
    <li> I thought I ordered blondish but received brown.  The spray can doesn&#x27;t spray. It clogs. Not happy at all.</li>
    <li> Great product for those days that your hair needs a little help. Covers up those roots and also gives a lift to your hair. Only need to spray a little to do the trick.</li>
    <li> If you want brown don&#x27;t get the &amp;#34;tint.&amp;#34;  Get brown.  With the tint you just have to use more.</li>
    <li> Love this product especially when I haven&#x27;t dyed my hair in a while and want to go out without showing my grays. Problem is if you toss your hair w your fingers they become brown.</li>
    <li> Awesome product does the job on my hair that is thinning a bit at the top.</li>
    <li> Like the product very much, it really creates the illusion of hair and easy to apply, however, it floats everywhere onto wall and mirrors and comes off on pillows and I have worried about what amount gets into your lungs.</li>
    <li> Good for between visits to the salon. I am very gray and use the spray powder on my hair part for coverage.&lt;br /&gt;Washes out on each shampoo.</li>
    <li> Definitely disappointed.  Previous to purchasing the product online, I bought it from a hair salon and loved the coverage.  Whatever has changed to the product, besides the &amp;#34;new packaging&amp;#34;, has rendered it useless for coverage purposes.  Bumble and Bumble needs to rethink the product chemistry.</li>
    <li> Good color coverage, but a matte finish.. A silky finish would be nice.</li>
    <li> Too expensive for what it is worth!</li>
    <li> The spray didn&#x27;t work when it arrived.  I submitted a request to replace it but no response for at least 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t function without this product. I have a cowlick on the crown of my head that looks like a bald spot. I also have dark, curly hair that likes to clump together and show other places on my scalp. My hair is full but very fine. This product covers those problem areas to give me a fuller look and it also works great as a root lifter. It can make your scalp feel greasy more quickly. And if you scratch your scalp while wearing it,  you&#x27;re bound to get it under your nails.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for quick cover up of gray hairs at the roots. You have to go easy on it though because it does add quite a bit of texture to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people seem to ask how dark it is for their shade of hair...which is pretty subjective to me. Here is a photo of my color of hair, which I consider dark brown.

    <li> Bought at a salon for a yr ago.  The spray nozzle didnt work very well at all. Sprayed unevenly and dripped. A year later I saw it had new packaging so i thought maybe the spray issue was fixed. Nope. Same exact problem. Returned.</li>
    <li> + Excellent merchandise +</li>
    <li> Works okay, but expensive compared to other brands of hair powder,</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go out without it!</li>
    <li> This product rocks.  Save money and the damage to your hair if your just starting to grey or if your mike me, and just have some minimal greying at the root and don&#x27;t eantot over use dyes and elongate the between factor between the processing.  Anyway, this product is light and no harsh smell.  I love it  Works fantastic!</li>
