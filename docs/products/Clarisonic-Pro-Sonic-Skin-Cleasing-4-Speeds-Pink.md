<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My friend, who is a dermatology PA, recommended this. I LOVE it!  My husband tried it and loved it SO much that he bought one in gray.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Both of the 1 star reviews are of the seller, not the product, and it brings the rating for this wonderful product down unfairly.  I have had this for 2 weeks, and I am already IN LOVE with it!!!  I am 36, with A LOT of sun damage.  I am already battling fine lines, and dry patches (I actually had skin that would flake off on my chin and nose due to dryness).  In the 1 week I have used this, ALL of my dry patches are GONE!!!  My skin is actually softer than before.  I really do believe what it says...it does help your products absorb better.  I loved mine so much (even in this short time), that I sent one home for my parents to use, and got one for my teenagers (each have different heads) to use for their acne (too soon to tell about that, but I will update it as soon as I see.  If you are hesitating at all...don&#x27;t.  It is wonderful, and you will not regret it.  I cannot wait to keep seeing the results I get with prolonged use.</li>
    <li> I want to preface my review by saying i&#x27;d never considered getting this product in the past and thought whats the use of a brush, i thought it was just a product from a company wanting to make money for something i could do with my hand and some cleaner.    However, i met a girl who raved about it and said she used it every day and that it did wonders for her skin - and she did have amazingly radiant skin so i thought &#x27;what the hell, i should give it a try&#x27; - and i&#x27;m glad i did.    Firstly, the first few days it made my skin feel very taught but greasy/shiny. Though, this might be attributed to me working a lot but not sleeping much (that can wreck havoc with skin)    Secondly, after using it for a little under a week, my skin is way softer than any peel, scrub etc can make it - its just so freakin soft and luminous!    Thirdly, i have chapped lips ALL year round, so used this on my lips too while doing my face, and my chapped lips have disappeared! no more dry skin, no cracks, just regular lips for the first time in forever    Fourthly, i have a rough patch on the back of my legs, and have been using this all week and theres a definate improvement. I&#x27;ll probably get the body head to maximize the benefits.    So, overall my skin is way smoother, smoother than its ever felt and its super clear (tho i don&#x27;t really get that many pimples anyway), moisturizer seems to work better. My pores don&#x27;t seem to look any different yet - though its only been less than 7 days, its super hot here and i&#x27;ve been overworking and undersleeping.    So, it seems like a stupid gadget that does nothing special but i&#x27;m actually shocked at how fantastic it is.    Will add progress report in a couple of months esp once the winter wind begins!</li>
    <li> I love my clarisonic. I recieved it as a gift for Christmas and have been using it once a day since. The first week ,as all the things previously hiding in my pores were cleaned out, I had a moderate breakout. It was a little frustrating. My skin is now super smooth and soft. Something I have never managed during harsh winter weather. I have even been going without makeup because my skin looks and feels so good I don&#x27;t need it too much. It&#x27;s everything I was hoping it would be, just don&#x27;t be put off by the initial breakout!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over a month and my pours are completely clean.  No more blackheads.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> My esthetician recommended this product to me as I was having breakouts again on my face and back, and I&#x27;m in my late 20s. In about a month, my face has cleared up. Even my husband commented that he thought it was a gimmick, but had to admit it seems to be working. I recommend going with  the pro version for a little more dough because you can get the body brush to go with it. I&#x27;ve been impressed with the battery life, too. I travel a lot and am able to take it with me and the battery will last for at least 4 or 5 days.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my &#x27;face&#x27; guy and I balked at the price. I got a good deal on Amazon and now I love this product! As a control experiment I used it on my left arm only to see if it was possible to get visible results and it is amazing. The age spots are diminished and my skin looks brighter after about a month. As for my face I can say my skin looks at least 5-10 years younger. The pores are smaller and there is a glow to my skin.Worth the money but I recommend using a high quality cleanser and sunscreen of course. Can&#x27;t wait to try the Opal.</li>
    <li> Within 2 months of purchase the thing simply stop working.  It is just a rip off.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> i have had it a couple weeks and i really like it. i am sure i should use it longer to see the full results but as of yet it has really evened out my skin tone</li>
    <li> This really is the best thing to come out in regards to your daily skincare routine.  My skin glows much more and I absoutely love how clean my skin feels from using this.  You really do get your money&#x27;s worth on this.  I haven&#x27;t heard of one bad review of this thing yet!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is incredible. All the good reviews are true. I&#x27;m 31 and have had acne my whole life. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 4 months in conjunction w/ Obagi products and I am acne free. My skin is brighter and looks healthy. It&#x27;s incredible. Good luck!</li>
    <li> has anyone experienced their batteries dying on them?  Are these replaceable.  Mine is a Clarisonic Mia and only had it 2 years and I&#x27;m unable to recharge the unit now.   Just curious if this happens with the upgraded versions.   Love it otherwise...</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my mom (&lt;3) for Christmas so she has been using it for about 3 weeks now.  Her skin is softer and I have noticed that her complexion is brighter and smoother.  I have also noticed that her pores have tightened up and are less visible.  Now I want one!  And I&#x27;m planning on getting one for my older sister for her mother&#x27;s day gift.  I have heard that you can also use the tool with different face masks like moisturizing masks or the new oxygen masks, but def. NO abrasive products.  It is a bit of an investment, but it makes any skincare work more effectively whether you are using drug store or prescription strength products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot about this product in the past, and I decided to try and get it to help out with my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t say that it works magic wonders, but I do feel that it definitely gets in there and cleans more thoroughly than you can do with just your hands and fingers.  I set it to the high speed for 2 minutes and use it once a day at night, when I shower.  My face feels pretty refreshed afterwards, so I&#x27;m happy with that.  I&#x27;d say to get the brush head pretty soapy and use some soap on your face as well so that there&#x27;s plenty for the Clarisonic to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the noises it makes: the first time it goes off and beeps at you, it&#x27;s warning you that there is enough battery left for one more use.  The second time it beeps at you, you need to go and charge it.  Just an FYI for users, since it took me a little while to realize that, even after reading the manual....I&#x27;m not certain they make that point clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t ever have issues with messiness, which I read some people do, even if I use it over the sink.  This may be happening because they are pressing down too much--from what I know, it&#x27;s more efficient and better overall if you are only applying light pressure against your face with this tool.  Mashing it against your skin doesn&#x27;t make it better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a pointer: I&#x27;ve tried both the sensitive and normal brushes....the normal brushes are still pretty soft, so I&#x27;d say to get the sensitive only if you really have pretty touchy skin.  For a while, my skin required the sensitive, but now that it&#x27;s doing better I&#x27;ll be switching over to the normal replacement brushes.</li>
    <li> Love it!  If you can notice the difference between a manual tooth brush and an electric tooth brush, than you will definitely notice the difference when you use the Clarisonic to wash your face.  My face feels wonderful!</li>
    <li> I started using the clarisonic about 3 weeks ago.  Within a couple of days I noticed my skin was brighter and clearer.  In the past I have used glycolic acid products and Retin A.  I think my skin wasn&#x27;t exfoliating evenly and I had dark spots.  After a couple of weeks, even my husband noticed and said I looked ten years younger.  He barely notices anything.  Needless to say I am happy with my purchase.  I use the normal brush for my neck, chest and arms and have noticed a difference there also.</li>
    <li> I bought the Clarsonic Pro three months ago.  I am 60 and have developed Roseacea. I have to be careful how I clean my skin now - no more vigorous buffing with a washcloth and gritty cleanser, so I was starting to break out again.  My dermatologist recommended I take a look at it.  Said it was expensive but so were facials and extractions.  I can honestly say that I am so pleased with this purchase.  I had trouble with blackheads and bumps on my face, especially my nose and chin, that is gone now and my skin is absolutely glowing.  I was asked my age they other day and no one could believe it was 60.  I was told I looked to be in my mid to late 30&#x27;s as I have almost no wrinkles on my face.  I have also used the body brush on my feet, legs, elbows and arms along with Clinique&#x27;s Sparkle Skin. It has really made a difference.  Most of the time purchases like this are a bit disappointing but I have to tell you it&#x27;s the best investment I have made in a long time!</li>
    <li> Because my very good cosmetologist decided to \\&quot;retire\\&quot;, I had to start doing my own facials.  Very clean skin is key to a good facial and the Clarisonic Pro gently scrubs the skin.  I notice that any skin treatments have been more effective.</li>
    <li> I love my Clairsonic.  It really has made my skin smoother.  I got the pro deluxe because of the 4 speeds, but if you have small hands you may want to consider the Mia, as the Pro is larger.  I would definitely buy one again if I needed it.</li>
    <li> This Sonic Skin cleansing unit is the best ever.  Powerful but easy to use and change the brushes.  Can&#x27;t believe my skin is so soft and clean.</li>
    <li> I bought the Clarisonic out of desperation - I had lots of clogged pores and so many little bumps all over my face, not too unusual for oily skin.  When I first used the Clarisonic I was skeptical; it was nice, it was a massage for my face but would it do anything?  How could this soft little brush that just vibrated really make a difference?  I was shocked that just four days later I could actually see a change in my complexion!  My skin is smoother and polished looking.  This is the only way to thoroughly clean your face.  I use the device for four minutes morning and night, preferring to do each facial zone for one full minute.  I also use a 12% glycolic acid cream to aid exfoliation. I can&#x27;t get over how much things have improved.  It will take time for the deepest and largest bumps to clear up, but at least I know that new ones are not forming.  I just wish I had something like this years ago.  You may balk at the price, but this is a quality product and once you use it you will never want to be without it again.</li>
    <li> I love Clarisonic! The pro has 4 speeds for when you want a light wash to a deep clean on speed 4. I truly love this product, I can&#x27;t say enough. I had a issue with breakouts and this has totaly transformed my skin. My face looks a 100 times better after using this product. I barely breakout around my menstrual cycle but thats just something I guess happens to alot of women. I was a bit skeptical because of the price but now I couldn&#x27;t be more happier. Just get it, you&#x27;ll love it too!</li>
    <li> Long lasting battery!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like gimmicks.  I don&#x27;t believe commercials.  I would never have bought this had it not been for who recommended it.  Its the best thing i&#x27;ve ever used on my face!  my pores are so clean.  i don&#x27;t care what other exfoliators, creams, pore cleaners, etc...that i&#x27;ve used in the past, they don&#x27;t work.  THIS WORKS&gt;</li>
    <li> Item came on time and with no problems. Price was a little lower than other sellers. Would buy from them again.</li>
    <li> The Clarisonic was recommended to me by a friend, I decided to choose this model because of all the options and I&#x27;m glad I did. I love that you can switch from sensitive to normal settings and I bought the body brush and deep cleansing one as well. If you fill out the registration info you can get a coupon for $25 off $50 @ Clarisonic.com so I recommend doing that. Also, I love the cleansers that come with it and I have bought a larger size of one of those as well. It&#x27;s nice that they give you 3 different cleansers which not all of them offer, so that you can see which works best with your needs. For as expensive as it is, Amazon offers a great price and it sure is worth it! I even have my boyfriend using it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to purchase one of these.  In merely a week, my skin feels as though I had a fabulous facial.  My skin products absorb much more effectively.  You can also use the Clarisonic with other cleansing products, although, they recommend using theirs.</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time last night and this morning as I just got it yesterday.  I felt like my face was super cleansed and all of the product that i put on my face at night seemed to soak into my pores!  I love using this, although it tickled my nose a little.  The true test is how my face will look in a few weeks!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately it did not work, Amazon did not charge me, i only had to pay the customs.&lt;br /&gt;I did buy one near by and discovered that it is a great product that I would recommend to anybody.</li>
    <li> Quick arrival. Very happy with the product. Came with three sample size cleansers. Love the sleek design and the multiple speeds. Only request is that for the price it would also come with a body brush. Will definitely be buying one soon!</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I am not like the many reviewers who started off with \\&quot;pretty good skin.\\&quot; My skin is fairly terrible: I have huge pores, sun damage, acne scars, and rosacea that usually flares up with the slightest change in my skincare routine. I honestly did not have high hopes for success with the Clarisonic, and I have been extremely pleased with the results so far. I have been using the Clarisonic Pro for about six weeks, and while it can&#x27;t work miracles, I never expected my skin to look as good as it does. I have been using a very gentle cleanser twice a day along with the sensitive head, but I have experienced no irritation. My pores look smaller, my skin tone is more even, and my face feels incredibly soft. I feel much less self-conscious without foundation, and when I do apply make up it goes on much smoother than before I started using this product. At 45, I still have occasional breakouts, and I have found that they clear up much faster now that I&#x27;m using the Clarisonic. I was afraid I would regret this purchase, but it has been worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I truly love my Clarisonic Pro!!!! My face is radiant and super clean with this device.  Mine is 4 speed.  It beeps when one area is clean and tells you to move to the next area.  The clarisonic cleansers are great but small.  I use Philosophy&#x27;s Purity with my Clarisonic!!! Love the pink too!!!</li>
    <li> My face never felt cleaner and my pores are much smaller. Fine lines are less noticable as well...[[ASIN:B0049LRA2C Clarisonic Pro Sonic Skin Cleansing for Face and Body - Pink]]</li>
    <li> Last few facialists have used this on me and I love it. I want one but can&#x27;t justify the price. Patience and a soft toothbrush are its equivalent.</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh! This is such a fantastic product! I often use makeup &amp; sunscreen, &amp; this is the only thing that has really cleaned my face completely. I&#x27;ve been wanting this ever since Oprah had this on her show years ago...just have been to cheap to buy it. If I knew how well this worked I would have bought it long ago. My face now appears like it actually has less wrinkles...no joke!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used to go out and have drinks with the girls I would always break out quite a bit the next day. We went out this Sat., &amp; I had a perfectly clear skin the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my daughter since she breaks out on her arm. This may take longer to see an improvement since she has many. I&#x27;ve been using the deep cleansing brush head that I bought separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the Clarisonic Pro is worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addie H.  Port Orange, FL</li>
    <li> Great facial brush!  Helped out with my acne significantly!</li>
    <li> This is my first one of these, so I can&#x27;t compare it to other models or brands, but I do like it.  I feel like my skin is softer, and more &amp;#34;receptive&amp;#34; to products I apply.  My only complaint is the &amp;#34;user interface.&amp;#34;  There are very few buttons with which to change a myriad of settings and all of the confirmation tones sound similar.  However, Since I&#x27;ve now got the settings I like, I don&#x27;t see really monkeying with that anymore, so not really a big problem.  The product is good at holding a charge, too.</li>
    <li> The product itself is good however, I will never order for Livewater again. This product was supposed to be a Christmas gift for my daughter. I ordered the wrong one and ask if I could exchange it. They told me it would be a 50% restocking fee ($100) if the product was open and 30% if it wasn&#x27;t. THAT&#x27;S CRAZY!!!! This company needs better customer service care. I will NEVER order for Livewater AGAIN!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have seen an incredible difference in my complexion in just a month.  I would recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> I heard alot of great things about this product so I bought it.I am just not sure it deserves all of the rave reeviews. It is nice but it hasnt changed my skin that much.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush, love the color.  My face has never felt so clean after a washing.  It exfoloiates and massages.  Once you get used to it, you don&#x27;t want to go with out.</li>
    <li> We have both this Pro version and two Mias and it seems like the Mias are already toast... and we got the Mias much later than the Pro.  One Mia has had water leakage while another has very little battery capacity.  The Pro does keep on going!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip, the batteries inside are series of NiMH AA rechargeables.  So depending on what you believe, you might want to completely discharge before charging to prolong the batteries.  (Although the best practice for maintaining NiMH batteries is debatable, now you know what&#x27;s inside!)  And nooo, opening the Clarisonics will destroy them, so don&#x27;t do it to replace dead batteries.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best investments I&#x27;ve ever made!!  After all the money you spend in order to get the skin you&#x27;ve been longing for, you might as well just buy this device and save money long-term... SERIOUSLY!!  I&#x27;m very practical and a penny pincher.  I don&#x27;t mind getting high quality products but I&#x27;m always looking for the hidden deal or bargain.  This device no matter where you go or which model will cost you over $100 but it is worth it!!!    I&#x27;ve only used it for one week and so far I&#x27;ve noticed dramatic results.      Naturally, my skin is very oily and acne-prone.  I have surface wrinkles around my face and mid-size pores. Before I bought the clarisonic, I did a facial peel that really helped with the dull texture and minimize acne scars.  I found that after using the clarisonic it has only enhanced the effects.  My wrinkles are very minimal.  The clarisonic has made my complexion brighter.  My breakouts have reduced within a week.  My pores are minimized and less noticeable under makeup.  I have a softer texture and it&#x27;s especially evident with my make up on!!  I notice I require less product (ie foundation) to apply as a little goes a longer way.  I feel much more confident about not wearing make up on the days I don&#x27;t feel like it.      I will say a few days after using the clarisonic, my skin went from oily to spotty dry patches.  I think my skin was not used to the new cleaning regime as I was experimenting with different speeds. I have since stayed on the \\&quot;normal\\&quot; speed and \\&quot;normal\\&quot; brush until my skin gets used to it.  I&#x27;m definitely less oily too!    While my skin texture is now very smooth, my acne scars are not completely gone and this is where keeping up with a peel regime ([[ASIN:B0018P2ZEA Jessner&#x27;s Chemical Peel Kit Anti-aging and Anti-acne Skin Care Treatment]]) will eventually fade the dark spots.  I am so excited and in awe and honestly, can&#x27;t stop looking at my skin in the mirror.      Also my husband has been using it on his face as he hasingrown hairs where his side burns should be.  His face, within a week, has become much more even in texture and color.  The bumps on his face are beginning to smooth out and the ingrown hairs are surfacing on their own now!  He noticed a dramatic difference.    Now I want to buy it for my mom and aunt just to bless them!    By the way, you can find the clarisonic brushes on eBay for about $10 a pop when it&#x27;s time to replace them!    UPDATE:  It&#x27;s been three weeks and I can&#x27;t express how healthy my skin looks.  My skin is radiant and soft.  I noticed my Retin-A works quicker and more effectively at zapping any surfacing zits... especially as I entered into a hormonal break out.  I did notice I&#x27;m still breaking out during that time of month, but my skin is still glowing and the Retin-A turned it around in 48 hours.  I still am experiencing some dry patches on my temples so I have moved back to sensitive brush, but I think Retin-A is also playing a factor in the combination.  Still trying to figure out the balance, but really this is so minor compared to what I used to deal with!!  My skin has NOT looked this good since highschool... and that was after my prescribed skin peels and oral acne treatment.  I AM SO HAPPY!!</li>
    <li> Be prepared - once you start using a Clarisonic, you&#x27;ll be addicted for life. I don&#x27;t feel clean unless I use this every time I wash my face. I leave it in my shower and charge it every two weeks. It is has held up for over three years with absolutely no problems.</li>
    <li> I ordered this over two years ago and have been delighted with the improvement it has made to my skin. I alternate the lighter brush with a deeper clean brush to get the maximum benefit. I am pleased to say I no longer need facials at all-in fact my facialist confirmed that once you have a Clarisonic any facials will really have little value adding properties. Not only that but the wand stopped recharging a couple of weeks ago and the simply outstanding customer relations that this firm has got me a new one in 2 weeks so I can resume the good work. If only more US companies had intelligent, pleasant call center staff like Clarisonic...but they don&#x27;t. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I was amazed at how clean my face felt the first time I used it. What a difference it made in just a couple of days, my skin is so much clearer and youthful looking. I will never be without it!</li>
    <li> Wife thinks its the best thing since slice bread.</li>
    <li> I have had a clarisonic for about 1 and a half years , I have been acne free for about a year! Your face gets super soft and if you have any peeling then this gets rid of the peeling. They have proactive brushes that are similar but they just aren&#x27;t the same and they don&#x27;t last as long. It may be a little expensive but it&#x27;s worth it!! No doubt!!</li>
    <li> I had heard good things about the Clarisonic Pro but was skeptical. I just received mine yesterday and after charging it for 24 hours as recommended, I used it this morning. I had to resist the temptation to push too hard, like when I scrub my face with a washcloth, because they said not to. I couldn&#x27;t believe that only one minute was needed for my entire face, but that is what the instructions read. It beeps and pauses to let you know when to move to another part of your face. I used the blue cleanser that came with it to clarify and balance. I must say, after one minute of use, I rinsed my face and applied moisturizer, and it absorbed into the skin VERY quickly, which it had not done before. I could almost feel the pores drinking it in! My face also felt so smooth after just the one treatment, I am looking forward to feeling it after a week of use! It really cleared the pores as advertised. I think I am now addicted to this machine, and will really love it! I have used so many scrubs and cleansers over the years, this is a real treat as it is so easy and no scrubbing required. It really is amazing and does what it says. I have mild adult acne once in awhile and I think this will work great for that. I feel so squeaky clean now, I am ordering the body brush, too. I would recommend this product so far, I hope it doesn&#x27;t break down in a couple weeks or months! There is a good guarantee, too. I decided to spend more to get the pro model after reading some negative reviews about the cheaper models breaking down. We&#x27;ll see if it is worth it in the long run.</li>
    <li> This was the biggest disappointment. I would never expect to get a defective product from Amazon...but I am assuming that they got this product at a discount for being aged or defective inventory?  I followed the instructions to charge the item before using... it worked for about 20 seconds and then stopped working altogether..I think a quality check should have been done to know that this was defective --- before it was sent to me.  Now, the lead time is over a month for replacement, so I am canceling. Sidenote: AMAZON should refund you the money immediately upon the notification from UPS on the return...I would not be happy about waiting two months or more for a credit.</li>
    <li> Purchasing this product has been THE single BEST thing that I have done for my complexion, EVER! When i was young, they made me drink lemon juice to try to dry out my skin, gross! Then I was even told that \\&quot;bad skin was my cross to bear\\&quot; CRAZY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t regret this purchase, you will be wondering WHY you waited so long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just Buy it!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Clarisonic for over 2 years and I love it.  If I miss a day, I feel it; my skin products absorb nicely, my makeup is gone and frankly my dermatologist says my skin looks great.  I just upgraded to the Mia2 and love it better than the Mia; Do yourself a favor and get this product.  Make sure you get a cleanser that suds because otherwise it doesn&#x27;t work as well.  Also, do your neck and chest every 3 days, around your ears helps to keep those age lines around your ears from showing up.</li>
    <li> I recently lost my old Clarisonic and had to immediately purchase this one as a replacement! It came SUPER fast and everything was brand new as advertised. This is the greatest! I see a huge difference in my skin- less breakouts, smaller pores, softer/glow. It&#x27;s amazing. I would recommend this to anyone who wants awesome skin!</li>
    <li> I am so delighted with my Clarsonic!  It is fun to use, feels great, and I can see results in a little over one week!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. My face looks so much better already and its only been a month. My husband even uses it now because he noticed how fabulous my skin looks. I ordered more brushes because i dropped mine in the shower and parts broke off but its still useable. Thanks for a great product.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> I love this thing and hate that it won&#x27;t hold a charge. I have to keep it plugged up constantly in order to use it. It is very annoying. Supposedly this is all the life I can expect.</li>
</ol>
