      <li>Still works great!  </li>
      <li>This is the best.</li>
      <li>It is perfect under my makeup</li>
      <li>The company makes many excellent skin products.  </li>
      <li>The Face Screen is a good value.  </li>
      <li>Buy it and you&#x27;ll love it, too!</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used a bioelements product that I don&#x27;t love!</li>
      <li>I have used this product for more than 8 years.  </li>
      <li>My favorite day  cream.  </li>
      <li>never looked better</li>
      <li>one is ok..</li>
      <li>Really enjoy the product!</li>
      <li>Why not make it super pleasant and easy?</li>
      <li>I love going to the pool during the summer</li>
      <li>The cream is light and very easy to apply, under make-up, or even with no make-up.  </li>
      <li>My skin is neither dry nor oily and I find the texture of this product to be perfect.</li>
      <li>I am a redhead and tend to burn easily</li>
      <li>Strong SPF</li>
      <li>I have fair skin and spend a lot of time in Tahoe which is high altitude.  </li>
      <li>She swears by this product line and was extremely happy to receive this as a present.</li>
      <li>Great product, especially if you have a pool or are out in the sun a lot.  </li>
      <li>Rich and not greasy.</li>
      <li>so the SPF 50 really excited me.</li>
      <li>I was really excited about this product when I saw it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Bioelements SPF 50 Broad Spectrum Face Screen is possibly the best combination moisturizer and sun protection out there.  </li>
      <li>This product really does deserve five stars - and more.  </li>
      <li>My eyes do get irritated easily from most sunscreens, so I do have to be careful with many products.  </li>
      <li>This product really protects but is light in texture smells clean.</li>
      <li>So no, I&#x27;m not crazy about this product.</li>
      <li>I discontinued this(and switched back to my original daytime moisturizer)  but still wear the Bioelements Sleepwear at night and that seems to be a better combination.  </li>
      <li>If u have dry skin&lt;br /&gt;You will probably love it!</li>
      <li>I tried this at a friends and was pretty excited because my skin didn&#x27;t react at all, and at 50 SPF I can feel really protected in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I loved all the other Bioelements products that she used during my facial, so I thought I would love this moisturizing sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>Although I did not get the moisturizer sunscreen near my eyes, it was strong enough to irritate them and I felt immediately better</li>
      <li>I have used this product for several years and really enjoy it.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth a million dollars to me and my red rosacea face!</li>
      <li>I use it 12 months a year even though I live up north.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is more money than I&#x27;d usually spend</li>
      <li>I recommend for anyone with skin that is normal to sensitive.</li>
      <li>I have a few things that work fine for me (Eucerin has a night cream for rosacea sufferers that I use), but I had yet to find any product with SUNSCREEN that didn&#x27;t make me feel like my face was on fire.</li>
      <li>but don&#x27;t get near eyes if your going to sweat , it will burn.</li>
      <li>Hazard score key for this in Skin Deep is 8 / 10 (very High hazard).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 50 and have dry skin and really need the moisture and SPF</li>
      <li>I generally like Bioelement products and&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Bioelements for years and highly recommend it for dry skin.</li>

<li> At this point, there are very few products I can put on my face that don&#x27;t have my face burning and red as a tomato in seconds.</li>
<li> Only complaint - the packaging.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s glass and too heavy</li>
<li> And you should be using sun screen every day, all year round.  </li>
<li> I have rosacea that has gotten worse as I&#x27;ve aged.</li>
<li> I am so disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent service and product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Bioelements for years and highly recommend it for dry skin. Everybody thinks I&#x27;m 20 years younger than I am!</li>
    <li> My skin is neither dry nor oily and I find the texture of this product to be perfect. Rich and not greasy. Having had skin cancer, I wear it every day; rain or shine. Only complaint - the packaging. It&#x27;s glass and too heavy so when I travel, I transfer it to a plastic container.</li>
    <li> I generally like Bioelement products and&lt;br /&gt;This one is ok.. Strong SPF but I have oily skin and this does&lt;br /&gt;Not help that. I still will use it sparingly. If u have dry skin&lt;br /&gt;You will probably love it!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used a bioelements product that I don&#x27;t love!</li>
    <li> 1st time using this particular one , it feels a little rough , not smooth as I was expecting but it definitely protect my face!!</li>
    <li> I have fair skin and spend a lot of time in Tahoe which is high altitude.  This product really protects but is light in texture smells clean.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and really enjoy it.  It is perfect under my makeup and I like the SPF protection.</li>
    <li> Really enjoy the product!</li>
    <li> I use several bio element products . I like this one when I know I&#x27;ll be outdoors playing tennis but don&#x27;t get near eyes if your going to sweat , it will burn. I&#x27;m 50 and have dry skin and really need the moisture and SPF so I would recommend but not if you have oily skin. I,pat it on from my forehead to my chest.</li>
    <li> I have used Bioelements SPF 50 Face Screen for the last 3 summers.  Great product, especially if you have a pool or are out in the sun a lot.  Don&#x27;t know of any other moisturizer that offers SPF 50.</li>
    <li> For Sunscreen, according to Skin Deep, should say No to Oxybenzone, which is 6% here. Hazard score key for this in Skin Deep is 8 / 10 (very High hazard). Should stay away from this for your health.</li>
    <li> I bought this after getting a facial where they used Bioelements products.  In the beginning I used it in the morning and Bioelements Sleepwear in the evening.  Even though I have oily skin, my face ended up having a shiny  appearance by the end of the day.  I discontinued this(and switched back to my original daytime moisturizer)  but still wear the Bioelements Sleepwear at night and that seems to be a better combination.  So no, I&#x27;m not crazy about this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from an esthetician recently.  I loved all the other Bioelements products that she used during my facial, so I thought I would love this moisturizing sunscreen.  Although I did not get the moisturizer sunscreen near my eyes, it was strong enough to irritate them and I felt immediately better once I washed my face.  I had to return the product.  My eyes do get irritated easily from most sunscreens, so I do have to be careful with many products.  I did notice that the other Bioelements product with the lower SPF 15 did not bother my eyes, however.</li>
    <li> I was really excited about this product when I saw it on Amazon. I love going to the pool during the summer and I adore Bioelements products. Unfortunately I can get better coverage using a drug store SPF 30 lotion for my face. I am a redhead and tend to burn easily so the SPF 50 really excited me. I feel I should mention that I only go out for two hours at a time and never get my face wet. I am so disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is the best. It has saved my face from brown spots. I use it 12 months a year even though I live up north.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a while, and since beginning daily application I have not been burned and my skin&lt;br /&gt;has never looked better</li>
    <li> I have used this product for more than 8 years.  Recently moved from one climate to another.  Still works great!  I recommend for anyone with skin that is normal to sensitive.</li>
    <li> I gave my daughter this for a Christmas present.  She swears by this product line and was extremely happy to receive this as a present.</li>
    <li> My favorite day  cream.  It is EXCELLENT.  I have been using it for years.  Buy it and you&#x27;ll love it, too!</li>
