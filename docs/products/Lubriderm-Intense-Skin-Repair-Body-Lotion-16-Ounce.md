      <li>I especially love laying my hand by my head on my pillow and falling asleep to that peaceful smell.</li>

      <li>This would be the perfect product if there was a completely unscented version!</li>
      <li>This body cream is amazing the moisturizing benefits it has are outstanding, it leave my skin feeling like a baby</li>
      <li>These people are nuts as are many others.  </li>
      <li>I make sure to always have this in my house.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in any stores in my area, so I order from amazon.  </li>
      <li>, I have scented lotion I love.</li>
      <li>What I love about this lotion is that even though it provides plenty of moisture to my skin, it is NOT oily or greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This is the best lotion I&#x27;ve found to use on dry skin.  </li>
      <li>I like the rich, creamy consistency and the nice fresh scent.  </li>
      <li>Fragrance free</li>
      <li>B004D2DPNK Lubriderm Lubriderm Men&#x27;s 3-in-1 Lotion, Body, Face and Post-shave Lotion, Light Fragrance, 1-Pound]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many over the years, and the intense lotions tend to either sit on the top of my skin, or just feel sticky or goopy</li>
      <li>The price is really good compared to that of my local CVS.</li>
      <li>and I like the convenience of a quick pump and go.</li>
      <li>It started working the FIRST day I used it!</li>
      <li>I purchased this lotion for my daughter and she seems to be satisfied with it thus far.</li>
      <li>one highly recommend it and the light scent is a plus for me</li>
      <li>It has a very light scent and works well for really dry areas.</li>
      <li>I used to live in Arizona, and now live in Utah, and this lotion is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered Lubriderm Intense Skin Repair Calming Relief Lotion.</li>
      <li>and this is the only one that helped smooth them.  </li>
      <li>I suggest using this product at bedtime because it does leave a residue that lasts for hours which is very inconvienent during the day.</li>
      <li>I tried almost every lotion recommended and this is the only one that has significantly helped.</li>
      <li>residue factor is the only reason I did not give this product a full five stars.</li>
      <li>still another fabric softener then go spend boo-coo bucks on an expensive perfume and/or aftershave and THINK they smell good - all you get is a ghastly potpourri smell that leaves people gasping for fresh air as you enter the room or even pass by...</li>
      <li>I highly  recommend it</li>
      <li>For this reason, I only use it right before bed.  </li>
      <li>People bathe in scented soap, wash and condition their hair in a totally different fragrance, use a deodorant with yet another fragrance, slather on moisturizing lotion in another fragrance, wear clothing that is so permeated with an overwhelming other fragrance from another scented laundry soap and</li>
      <li>The fragrance is somewhat feminine, so any guys reading this may want to be aware that Lubriderm also makes a lotion especially for men:</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little too strong for my liking.</li>
      <li>No lotion for skin needing intense or even moderate repair, should have fragrance in it!  </li>
      <li>Based on the reviews and the knowledge &amp; experience of earlier lubriderm products I had made the choice and a choice I made very well.</li>
      <li>and this lady praised it after using it on her 4 month old baby!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They keep my heels soft.</li>
      <li>It definitely does last 24 hours or so; I reapply it right after I shower.</li>
      <li>I have tried 7-8 different lotions for the past 15 years and this is my favorite.</li>
      <li>It heals my dry cracks very well.</li>
      <li>and I bought an extra for my 100 year old Dad who has damaged arms from years of golf.</li>
      <li>I do recommend this product to anyone with high dry</li>
      <li>I developed extremely dry skin after moving to the dry southwest from always living in humid climates my whole life.</li>
      <li>Makes scented lotion (perfume kind that can be expensive) last longer.</li>
      <li>I used this once, and in less than a month the dryness issue was resolved and my skin healed completely after a month and returned to normal skin color.</li>
      <li>My hands were becoming very dry and had dark damaged spots on my skin around my knuckles due to the dryness.</li>
      <li>Less intense lotions don&#x27;t do the trick.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used other lotions on my hand but fingers still split when I open my fingers, but not so with this particular form of Lubriderm.....</li>
      <li>I highly recommend for other men who have the same issue.</li>

<li> It definitely helped relieve the itching and the moisture lasts quite a long time!</li>
<li> Have my hands in water a lot and in the winter they get so dry that when I spread my fingers open, the skin splits.  </li>
<li> It does feel a little heavy when you first apply it</li>

<li> I am a man and no matter how you look at it, dry, itchy, flaky skin is unattractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I have eczema on my dry dry hands.</li>
<li> Her skin, according to her, is not as dry as it was, so I guess then it&#x27;s working.</li>
<li> They offer a few fragrance free alternatives so why does fragrance, just another irritating chemical, have to be added.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve always had super dry skin and during the dry, winter climate it gets very irritating.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every lotion and cream on my rough, scaly feet</li>
<li> I do like my creams to have scent and is no reason to remove stars even if I disliked scents I would give this cream the proper rating it deserves.</li>
<li> I used to have a lot of trouble with dry, cracked, bleeding skin on my hands in the winter.</li>
<li> My only complaint is that this lotion leaves a sticky residue once you get it rubbed in.</li>
<li> I have been using this product for week and half now</li>
<li> I use it every night before I go to bed, year round.</li>
<li> while thinking, &#x27;what an insecure, low self-esteemed person</li>

    <li> Based on the reviews and the knowledge &amp; experience of earlier lubriderm products I had made the choice and a choice I made very well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this lotion for my daughter and she seems to be satisfied with it thus far. The price is really good compared to that of my local CVS. Her skin, according to her, is not as dry as it was, so I guess then it&#x27;s working. The scent too is over perfumey and it&#x27;s not a watery lotion either.</li>
    <li> No lotion for skin needing intense or even moderate repair, should have fragrance in it!  These people are nuts as are many others.  They offer a few fragrance free alternatives so why does fragrance, just another irritating chemical, have to be added.  People bathe in scented soap, wash and condition their hair in a totally different fragrance, use a deodorant with yet another fragrance, slather on moisturizing lotion in another fragrance, wear clothing that is so permeated with an overwhelming other fragrance from another scented laundry soap and still another fabric softener then go spend boo-coo bucks on an expensive perfume and/or aftershave and THINK they smell good - all you get is a ghastly potpourri smell that leaves people gasping for fresh air as you enter the room or even pass by...while thinking, &#x27;what an insecure, low self-esteemed person he/she must be to feel they have to go to such lengths to draw attention to themselves&#x27;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered Lubriderm Intense Skin Repair Calming Relief Lotion. Fragrance free and this lady praised it after using it on her 4 month old baby!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TSLB3M/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o06_s00_i00</li>
    <li> I have eczema on my dry dry hands. It definitely helped relieve the itching and the moisture lasts quite a long time! Definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion! I make sure to always have this in my house. It has a very light scent and works well for really dry areas. I put a good amount on my feet before bed then slip socks on. They keep my heels soft. I use hand sanitizer and in the winter, this keeps my skin from being dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have scented lotion I love. I&#x27;ll put a bit of the Lubriderm lotion and scented lotion, mix them in my hands and put them on. Makes scented lotion (perfume kind that can be expensive) last longer.</li>
    <li> It heals my dry cracks very well.</li>
    <li> It works so well that I just reorder it.</li>
    <li> This body cream is amazing the moisturizing benefits it has are outstanding, it leave my skin feeling like a baby one highly recommend it and the light scent is a plus for me I do like my creams to have scent and is no reason to remove stars even if I disliked scents I would give this cream the proper rating it deserves.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had super dry skin and during the dry, winter climate it gets very irritating. I have tried 7-8 different lotions for the past 15 years and this is my favorite. I am a man and no matter how you look at it, dry, itchy, flaky skin is unattractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels much softer yet firm and not mushy. It definitely does last 24 hours or so; I reapply it right after I shower. What I love about this lotion is that even though it provides plenty of moisture to my skin, it is NOT oily or greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a star off because it of the fragrance. It&#x27;s a little too strong for my liking. This would be the perfect product if there was a completely unscented version! However, the product works so well that I do not mind the fragrance and will keep coming back to buy this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for week and half now and it&#x27;s amazing. I&#x27;m very happy on the results. I do recommend this product to anyone with high dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P. Sambo</li>
    <li> This is great for sun damaged arms and I bought an extra for my 100 year old Dad who has damaged arms from years of golf.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every lotion and cream on my rough, scaly feet and this is the only one that helped smooth them.  I like the rich, creamy consistency and the nice fresh scent.  This lotion does take some rubbing to get it to soak into your skin but I get an nice foot massage in the process!  My only complaint is that this lotion leaves a sticky residue once you get it rubbed in. For this reason, I only use it right before bed.  I use a different lotion for daytime.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I&#x27;ve found to use on dry skin.  My fingertips sometimes crack and become sore, but not since I&#x27;m using Lubriderm.  I highly  recommend it</li>
    <li> Have my hands in water a lot and in the winter they get so dry that when I spread my fingers open, the skin splits.  I&#x27;ve used other lotions on my hand but fingers still split when I open my fingers, but not so with this particular form of Lubriderm.....after application, fingers did not split at all and that tells me I&#x27;ve found a good moisturizer and I like the convenience of a quick pump and go.</li>

Since I then I have tried various other quality name brands, and this has still outperformed. I highly recommend for other men who have the same issue.</li>
    <li> I developed extremely dry skin after moving to the dry southwest from always living in humid climates my whole life. My skin was rough and cracked and would leave tiny white specks of dead skin on my clothes, it was gross. My knuckles would crack and bleed all the time too. I tried almost every lotion recommended and this is the only one that has significantly helped. It started working the FIRST day I used it! It does feel a little heavy when you first apply it but after about 30 min - 1hr it soaks in all the way. I hate lotion that leaves your skin clammy and oily but this stuff is great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good. I use it daily.</li>
    <li> Oooooh, this is the best.  I used to live in Arizona, and now live in Utah, and this lotion is fantastic.  I&#x27;ve tried many over the years, and the intense lotions tend to either sit on the top of my skin, or just feel sticky or goopy (is that a word?).  Less intense lotions don&#x27;t do the trick.  This one does.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in any stores in my area, so I order from amazon.  Don&#x27;t settle, ladies (or gents!).  Give this one a try.</li>
    <li> I used to have a lot of trouble with dry, cracked, bleeding skin on my hands in the winter. I have tried different products but for the past several years I have stuck with Lubriderm Intense Skin Repair to prevent and treat the dryness. I use it every night before I go to bed, year round.

    <li> This lotion is a great lotion and it smells good too.</li>
    <li> Best lotion out there.</li>
