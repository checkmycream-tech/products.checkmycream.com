      <li>I usually buy bouffant caps and poke a hole in the middle, but these are much better!</li>
      <li>They just don&#x27;t fit the headrest unless I tear it a little and force it on.  </li>
      <li>for the thinness, i think that can be easily fixed by having a clothed cover</li>
      <li>Not for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I KNOW this item is new,, but it has a slight cologne-y smell that makes people wonder if the cradle is fresh.</li>
      <li>Small- doesn&#x27;t fit my cradle correctly</li>
      <li>and I bought these covers which barely fit the face cradle, they are to small.</li>
      <li>We do like the fact that we can change covers but would really like it a little wider so that it covers the whole pillow.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really understand how it is possible, one would think that they would be made all the same.</li>
      <li>Too small for my Golden Ratio face cradles.</li>

    <li> Small- doesn&#x27;t fit my cradle correctly</li>
    <li> They are a bit thin, but do the job.</li>
    <li> I take a lot of time, I am very happy if someone wants to buy a  , I advise you to buy this product</li>
    <li> These work great for BestMassage tables. Too small for my Golden Ratio face cradles. Not for sensitive skin. One client says they are too scratchy and after only a few minutes she had a red face.</li>
    <li> We do like the fact that we can change covers but would really like it a little wider so that it covers the whole pillow.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. Perfect for chair massages! The price is perfect and quality is great! Have ordered from them before and will again.</li>
    <li> These are very good for what I wanted and needed.  There is only one issue.  A small percentage of the covers are too small, for some reason.  They just don&#x27;t fit the headrest unless I tear it a little and force it on.  I don&#x27;t really understand how it is possible, one would think that they would be made all the same.</li>
    <li> The disposables are adequate, though they tend to leave an outline of the stitching on clients&#x27; faces, a mirror drawback.</li>
    <li> easy to install and replace. economical. easy to carry spares. hard wearing for tough bearded customers and soft for delicate ones.</li>
    <li> Softer than expected for disposable covers. Nice pop up box. Quick delivery. Great price. All good reasons to be really satisfied with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I bought a 3&amp;#34; memory foam face cradle and I bought these covers which barely fit the face cradle, they are to small. If I&#x27;m not careful putting the cover on it will rip it is so small. another problem with the cover is that the material is so thin that body oils can easily go right through it. In this case you get what you pay for, 100 ct. for under $25.</li>
    <li> When I had purchased these the face cradles cushions that I had were too big to be able to use these. So at first I was rather disappointed. Then I bought a second massage chair with a much thinner cushion (about a third as thick) on a Dolphin massage chair. So I now use those on for that chair but if you have a thicker cushion these will not fit properly (at least the ones that I received won&#x27;t).</li>
    <li> They are lightweight and breathable without transferring grease or makeup through them.</li>
    <li> Very functional and practical.</li>
    <li> Good to have in your bag if you are a massage therapist. It is thin but if you need more thickness use two. It does exactly what it says and the fitted form is perfect.</li>
    <li> The product is just OK - OK quality, OK fit - don&#x27;t expect anything too much and you wont be disappointed. The thing that really makes me feel as though this is not worth the money, is that the company charges $10 shipping which is outrageous considering the weight and size of the covers and certainly makes them less value for money.</li>
    <li> I picked this item becasue i was trying to find something better then thr disposable face cradle cover (non fitted)(differnt seller). The cradle covers are thick but do not go arund the cradle and can move if the client lifts his head. These fitted cover do the job, but as the title states, they are thin and smells a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abut the thinnnes,  i don&#x27;t have any cloth covers on the pleather face cradle, so when the oil from a shoulder/neck rub sinks in, it&#x27;s noticible shinny on the black face cradle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the smell. I KNOW this item is new,, but it has a slight cologne-y smell that makes people wonder if the cradle is fresh. It doesn&#x27;t stink, just smells like a good smelling man was previously there. No one wants left oevrs, so good smelling or not, the smell is not a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the thinness, i think that can be easily fixed by having a clothed cover underneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recomend this product for the style and price.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this item. It fits nice on my headrest on my massage table. It serves its purpose. Nice product. Thank you</li>
    <li> I have a large memory foam face cradle and this fits very tight.  It&#x27;s a good product, but I need a bit larger one.</li>
    <li> clients sometimes sweat thru the material...not as great on the fit to the cradle..ok not best..could just use a towel just as well.</li>
    <li> This works great and was shipped out really fast.  The may not fit all pillows as they elastic is tight in the middle but it works for our use.</li>
    <li> Excellent pricing for this product.  They hold up very well.</li>
    <li> I will be ordering this item in a future.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend.</li>
    <li> Just what we were looking for, works perfect on the massage table and The massage chair.</li>
    <li> The price was great, and they will do, but I feel they are slightly skimpy on my head rest. I would have appreciated it if they covered my head rest better.</li>
    <li> Price was practically the same as the paper covers but gave me the comfort that it wouldn&#x27;t slip off or moved out of place if the patient shifted.  Will definately buy again.</li>
    <li> I usually buy bouffant caps and poke a hole in the middle, but these are much better! For the same price they are fitted &amp; don&#x27;t easily slide off or rip!</li>
    <li> For throw aways they are just fine.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed!</li>
    <li> These are wonderful and work very well.</li>
    <li> Fits the headrest nicely! I definitely will recommend this to anyone who has their own spa, or has a massage bed.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my massage chair, they are a tad thin and are not as large as expected, they don&#x27;t cover the whole face cradle.</li>
    <li> Great fit for curved headrests/pillows. I wish they were a bit heavier so that liquids could not penetrate the fibers.</li>
