      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
      <li>Love this item...</li>
      <li>You have to wait for the infected part of the nail to grow out, but you&#x27;ll notice a change in your nail color where the healthy nail is growing.</li>
      <li>This product takes awhile to work, but it works better than anything I&#x27;ve used, including a prescription nail polish.</li>
      <li>, i will post more info at the end of the year.</li>
      <li>I bought three more bottles</li>
      <li>my toe nails are clear of fungus and beautiful like before</li>
      <li>It is so easy to use as it soaks into the nail and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
      <li>This can easily be taken off with a finger nail (I suggest after a shower, when it is at its softest).</li>
      <li>This product is easy to apply so compliance using it twice a day is no problem.</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend trying this product before taking any prescription medication (like pills).</li>
      <li>I was really hoping this would work but honestly did nothing.</li>
      <li>I am hopeful that with continued use my toenails will look better very soon.</li>
      <li>, it looks like is working, toe nails take a full year to grow all of it, so you have to be patient.</li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t tell which is better.</li>
      <li>Saw results fairly quickly.</li>
      <li>Says it can be worn with polish, but acts as a mild remover</li>
      <li>Develop 10 clear did ok.</li>
      <li>It does however keep the problem from spreading, so it is worth 3 stars.</li>
      <li>After several month of daily use I can honestly say that the fungus on my toenail is significantly better, if not gone.  </li>
      <li>I thought I was seeing results at first, but I wasn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of products and this is the first time anything has given any results.  </li>
      <li>; first (my salon sold it to me)</li>
      <li>my toe nails take forever to grow, and I always clip the big toe nails as much as I can to eliminate the brownish part, which is getting slightly better  with this solution.</li>
      <li>Much better than toxic pills required to take for a long time.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe how fast it has cleared up.</li>
      <li>This product is sooo  much easier.</li>
      <li>Works fast for me, and after two applications, the fungus looks almost gone.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
      <li>So who is really functioning?</li>
      <li>Was skeptical, but since it was cheap and reviews were good, I decided to try it.  </li>
      <li>Now I will use it every other day just to be safe.</li>
      <li>Strong and clear and not a speck of fungi (white spots) anywhere.</li>
      <li>I think it works better than lamisil because i took that several years ago and didn&#x27;t do much,  then I tried the liquid clotrimazol and that one takes forever to see results and if you stop applying it then the fungus comes back...</li>
      <li>Working pretty well as far as I can see.</li>
      <li>I can honestly say it&#x27;s not really gone yet, but it has definitely shunk.  </li>
      <li>I hunted around for a bit for a somewhat mild case...but even using it only when I remembered, definitely not daily, it still has improved a lot.</li>
      <li>and I can see clear nail growth beginning on my toes.  </li>
      <li>So far, I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement.</li>
      <li>This product has seemed to work on one of my big toes very well</li>
      <li>I developed nail fungus when my resistance was lowered by a tumor I had developed.  </li>
      <li>I actually put it on a few more times during the day .</li>
      <li>becuse most that try this will give up to easily and say it didn&#x27;t work instead of actually using at least half of the bottle before reviewing.</li>
      <li>It does make the nails look a bit better, but I am not sure it actually cures the fungus in the nails.</li>
      <li>It is a long term commitment if you really wish to cure your toenails.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m slowly clipping the gross stuff away:)</li>
      <li>four stars because it is still too early for final conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;Nice.</li>
      <li>Too early to tell, but I&#x27;ll update as things get better, stay the same, or get worse</li>
      <li>I have been applying this to my big toenail for the last two months and it is practically clear of the fungal infection now.  </li>

<li> Too early to tell, but I&#x27;ll update as things get better, stay the same, or get worse</li>
<li> I have been applying this to my big toenail for the last two months and it is practically clear of the fungal infection now.  </li>
<li> I switched to this from a similar gel (same active ingredient).  </li>
<li> Hard to tell if I really worked because I used it in combine with some oral medicine.</li>
<li> You have to be patient with nail fungus because it takes a long time for your nails to grow out.  </li>
<li> The key is you have to clip down nail as much as possible and then file your nail beds.  </li>
<li> but then the other big toe it has</li>
<li> Takes just a moment to dry after brushing it on.</li>
<li> it looks like it&#x27;s trying to dry up.  </li>
<li> (My left toenail had a whitish tinge forming on the outside of the nail, slowly getting larger, I guess from what my nail tech says, eventually it would pull up my nail).  </li>
<li> (I used to have to wait for the nail polish to dry and apply it twice daily for a week, so it would get messy).</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this for roughly a month and</li>
<li> Minimal</li>
<li> I cut the nails really short and applied the formula after I spent a half hour filing down the nail bed to make it thinner</li>
<li> I had toenail fungus on one big toe, wasn&#x27;t bad, I caught it before it became a real problem.  </li>
<li> It does the job, with less mess for me.</li>
<li> but after a few months I had no results.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your time.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m hoping in a few months time that the nails are thinner.  </li>
<li> Have been using for a few months.  </li>
<li> I have been applying this twice a day everyday and seen no results.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> This fungus is tough but I am seeing results and have not with other products.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t buy it unless you are planning to invest the time to rid yourself of it, because you are probably going to need at least three months if not more of treatment.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried everything to get rid of it, but it&#x27;s hard to get rid of.  </li>
<li> I had a painful big toe caused by fungus.  </li>
<li> Due to my past illness, I won&#x27;t go to the tablets....not much on side effects since I always seem to develop the bad ones! &#x3D;(  </li>
<li> I did learn that your inmune system is weak</li>
<li> UPDATE: didn&#x27;t work, I used it for like 8 months, and the toe nail didn&#x27;t get worse but didn&#x27;t get rid of the brownish part either.</li>
<li> You havevto Stay with it, every night after my shower I apply it without fail.</li>
<li> is been almost 3 months, I was skeptical to buy it, and i gave it a try</li>
<li> Very disappointed and would hate to see someone waste 3 months, hoping.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Too early to tell, but I&#x27;ll update as things get better, stay the same, or get worse</li>
    <li> still in use so will take time before i see the results</li>
    <li> I switched to this from a similar gel (same active ingredient).  I love that it brushes on and is invisible. Says it can be worn with polish, but acts as a mild remover so I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it.  It does the job, with less mess for me. Love it.</li>
    <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement.</li>
    <li> An Excellent product and a good value...</li>
    <li> Nothing magic with this product.  Nail fungus remedies are either tolnaftate or udelaic acid (probably misspelled).  This one is tolnaftate in a solution.  I have not be sucessful with either product, despite prolonged use.  It does however keep the problem from spreading, so it is worth 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I have had toenail fungus for decades and this product is working.  A note of caution though.  Toenails grow about one eighth inch a month.  You may not even know for sure it is working with one bottle.  It is a long term commitment if you really wish to cure your toenails.  Plan on a year of use.</li>
    <li> Started using this product almost a month ago and already I am seeing results.  I have been treating my feet nails for over a year with another product and has not seen any improvement.  This product is easy to apply so compliance using it twice a day is no problem.</li>
    <li> This stuff works! Cured me again!</li>
    <li> dries well, I dont know if it works cause i have been putting it on until my nail grows out. I cut the nails really short and applied the formula after I spent a half hour filing down the nail bed to make it thinner</li>
    <li> Bought this product on the urging of my daughter for my unsightly toe.  After several month of daily use I can honestly say that the fungus on my toenail is significantly better, if not gone.  I will continue to use this product and think it is great.  Much better than toxic pills required to take for a long time.</li>
    <li> I had a painful big toe caused by fungus.  I soaked it in listerine and vinegar, tried using vicks, and nothing worked.  I started using this last week.  I can&#x27;t believe how well it works!  The key is you have to clip down nail as much as possible and then file your nail beds.  Apply in the moring and night.  After drying, I also apply vit. E oil.  Try to go bare-footed as much as possible.  In three days the pain is gone and my nail is clearing up.</li>
    <li> Would give a 0 star if that&#x27;s an option. It DOES NOT work.</li>
    <li> After two months of use I have noticed substantial improvement on both of my big toes. Does not ruin nail polish.</li>
    <li> Fungi Free&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for a month and it looks like its helping but since I have had this problem for years im sure it will take more than one bottle. I think consumers just have to be patient becuse most that try this will give up to easily and say it didn&#x27;t work instead of actually using at least half of the bottle before reviewing. I must admit I am not following the directions by using it twice a day cause I&#x27;m sure if I had I would see even better results than I have seen already. I will definitely be ordering another bottle. Just remember most of us have had nail fungus for years so its going to yake time to gdt rid of it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> is been almost 3 months, I was skeptical to buy it, and i gave it a try, it looks like is working, toe nails take a full year to grow all of it, so you have to be patient. My big toes get brownish looking in one corner, and then after summer time they are really yellow because of the nail polish, and I don&#x27;t like that. my toe nails take forever to grow, and I always clip the big toe nails as much as I can to eliminate the brownish part, which is getting slightly better  with this solution. I will update this post at the end of the year and tell the results.  the brown corners are still there. I think it works better than lamisil because i took that several years ago and didn&#x27;t do much,  then I tried the liquid clotrimazol and that one takes forever to see results and if you stop applying it then the fungus comes back...so this one it looks like it works but i don&#x27;t want to get ahead of me yet, i will post more info at the end of the year. UPDATE: didn&#x27;t work, I used it for like 8 months, and the toe nail didn&#x27;t get worse but didn&#x27;t get rid of the brownish part either. I found a video on youtube about mixing lemon juice with baking soda to get rid of the yellowish tint from the nail polish and THAT WORKED, so now about the problem with the brownish toe nail I did learn that your inmune system is weak so I will take multivitamines .</li>
    <li> Have been using for a few months.  Minimal if any improvement.</li>
    <li> It does make the nails look a bit better, but I am not sure it actually cures the fungus in the nails.</li>
    <li> It is o&#x27;k product,no wonders.</li>
    <li> Develop 10 clear did ok. Haven&#x27;t seen any results yet.</li>
    <li> I developed nail fungus when my resistance was lowered by a tumor I had developed.  I&#x27;ve tried everything to get rid of it, but it&#x27;s hard to get rid of.  Due to my past illness, I won&#x27;t go to the tablets....not much on side effects since I always seem to develop the bad ones! &#x3D;(  I&#x27;ve been using this for roughly a month and it looks like it&#x27;s trying to dry up.  You have to be patient with nail fungus because it takes a long time for your nails to grow out.  I can honestly say it&#x27;s not really gone yet, but it has definitely shunk.  I&#x27;m hoping in a few months time that the nails are thinner.  I bought three more bottles so I definitely have faith that it&#x27;s working.  Don&#x27;t buy it unless you are planning to invest the time to rid yourself of it, because you are probably going to need at least three months if not more of treatment.  Toenails are slower to grow.</li>
    <li> Still using it! No changes yet!</li>
    <li> I got toe nail fungus  about 6 years ago and have tried everything possible and know products and nothing worked. I got this product in march and used it every day in the morning on my toes and  (((FINALLY))) my toe nails are clear of fungus and beautiful like before and I can now wear beautiful sandals.  THANK YOU  THANK YOU  THANK YOU  LOVE LOVE LOVE Now I will use it every other day just to be safe.</li>
    <li> good product &amp; service</li>
    <li> Love this item...I hunted around for a bit for a somewhat mild case...but even using it only when I remembered, definitely not daily, it still has improved a lot. Takes just a moment to dry after brushing it on. I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> This product takes awhile to work, but it works better than anything I&#x27;ve used, including a prescription nail polish. It is so easy to use as it soaks into the nail and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue. (I used to have to wait for the nail polish to dry and apply it twice daily for a week, so it would get messy). This product is sooo  much easier. The only thing that may deter people is that it dries your nails and seems to leave a white covering on the nail. This can easily be taken off with a finger nail (I suggest after a shower, when it is at its softest). You have to wait for the infected part of the nail to grow out, but you&#x27;ll notice a change in your nail color where the healthy nail is growing. I strongly recommend trying this product before taking any prescription medication (like pills).</li>
    <li> Hard to tell if I really worked because I used it in combine with some oral medicine. I applied it to my hand nail but not my toe nail, and both of them got cured. So who is really functioning? Oral drug or this one?</li>
    <li> This product has seemed to work on one of my big toes very well but then the other big toe it has not yet but i am still trying hope it helps that one too but i just started using this on it.</li>
    <li> I have been applying this to my big toenail for the last two months and it is practically clear of the fungal infection now.  Good result - it worked for me.</li>
    <li> Starting to work. You havevto Stay with it, every night after my shower I apply it without fail. This fungus is tough but I am seeing results and have not with other products.</li>
    <li> Was skeptical, but since it was cheap and reviews were good, I decided to try it.  So happy I did.  I had toenail fungus on one big toe, wasn&#x27;t bad, I caught it before it became a real problem.  I tried &amp;#34;No Miss&amp;#34; first (my salon sold it to me) but after a few months I had no results.  I know it takes awhile for the nail to grow out with the damaged nail, so please be patient.  When I tried this product, I followed directions and was very good about not missing any treatments. I actually put it on a few more times during the day . I can&#x27;t believe how fast it has cleared up. After a full month, I see a great improvement.  Faster than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply, either eyedropper or brush. Don&#x27;t know if it works for all cases or if there are different fungus&#x27;? This was my first ever problem, but it worked great for me.  (My left toenail had a whitish tinge forming on the outside of the nail, slowly getting larger, I guess from what my nail tech says, eventually it would pull up my nail).  It&#x27;s been about 2 months now and almost gone...just growing out and I&#x27;m slowly clipping the gross stuff away:) good luck! Any questions feel free to ask!</li>
    <li> My nails are amazing. Strong and clear and not a speck of fungi (white spots) anywhere. Saw results fairly quickly.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time.  I did it religiously morning and night for over 3 months and saw zero results.  I thought I was seeing results at first, but I wasn&#x27;t.  Very disappointed and would hate to see someone waste 3 months, hoping.</li>
    <li> Does not work. I have been applying this twice a day everyday and seen no results. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I was really hoping this would work but honestly did nothing.</li>
    <li> Received it in a couple of days, and used it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing. Works fast for me, and after two applications, the fungus looks almost gone.&lt;br /&gt;Only four stars because it is still too early for final conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;Nice.</li>
    <li> Working pretty well as far as I can see. I bought this product after using a different brand, so I really can&#x27;t tell which is better.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my husband who has dealt with toenail fungus for many years.  This product actually worked quite well. It took about a month to see a difference but it does work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about six weeks and I can see clear nail growth beginning on my toes.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of products and this is the first time anything has given any results.  I am hopeful that with continued use my toenails will look better very soon.</li>
