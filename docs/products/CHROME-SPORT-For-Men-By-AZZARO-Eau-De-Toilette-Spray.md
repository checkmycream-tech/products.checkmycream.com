      <li>you like Issey Miyake L&#x27;eau D&#x27;Issey you will most probably like this,but then again you might not depending how &amp;#34;scent snobby&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>What can I say more?</li>
      <li>I bought this one from the seller &amp;#34;Ox Kom&amp;#34; and found this to be 100% authentic.</li>
      <li>Love the smell.</li>
      <li>love the scent</li>
      <li>but he loves it &amp; such an amazing deal!!!</li>
      <li>great smell, fresh clean, with a hint of musk.</li>
      <li>I was very excited about getting the Chrome Sport after trying the testers.</li>
      <li>Smells delicious and lasts all day long.</li>
      <li>He likes it and more importantly I like it.</li>
      <li>very good...simple but good</li>
      <li>Very good price, large size, and the shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall its projection is moderate and it lasts a good duration of time especially on clothes which I am very happy</li>
      <li>This was a great price for this item and the size was very generous for the brands I love so much</li>
      <li>but it is so nice to be able to get it for a decent price as opposed to the $80 you would spend in a store like Macys for it.</li>
      <li>Has become my staple scent - where 1 sprays worth most mornings and 2 or 3 when going out.</li>
      <li>I decided to order the sport for my 16yr old son to see if it was as good as JUST chrome.</li>
      <li>It isnt an exact clone,but it has many of the floral characteristics Issey has ,but hasnt as BOLD of that floral note and though lighter than Issey the floral note is prominent although I smell a bit of ginger and citrus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Came well packaged, and it&#x27;s the original.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Chrome for a while, but not the Sport variation, decided to chance it, am not disappointed.</li>
      <li>It smells fantastic; clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>Over 12 hours of fresh clean scent.</li>
      <li>Great fresh scent that you can wear all year round.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery and accurate.</li>
      <li>Smells like fresh air</li>
      <li>he said it smells really fresh</li>
      <li>For reference, the fragrance reminds me of Gold Bond Fresh scent spray (which contains ginger root extract).</li>
      <li>Not as fancy as some other designer houses, but a good fragrance for the price.</li>
      <li>Got exactly what I wanted, and shipping was fast!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s crisp, fresh, and breezy for any time of the year.</li>
      <li>It has a nice initial kick that wakes you up in the morning and dries down to some nice warm middle notes.</li>
      <li>In this last purchase, everything was good (so far...).</li>
      <li>I like this scent very much.</li>
      <li>My girl smelled it and instantly fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>but it is a unique scent and has an awesome dry down with the white musk note.</li>
      <li>No fake, not a knock-off, but the real fragrance.</li>
      <li>I was very worried at first because this was a gift for my husband but thanks to the supplier</li>
      <li>Not only is this EDT spray super fresh smelling</li>
      <li>/&gt;IMO what I get from this particular scent is Issey Miyake!</li>
      <li>thank you so much</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Very close to chanel allure homme blanche.</li>
      <li>It is REAL.</li>
      <li>It is masculine, fresh, mild and lasts for a long while.</li>
      <li>It does not last quite as long as the original Chrome lasts, but doesnt wear off quickly by any means.</li>
      <li>Chrome is a manly cologne, long lasting,  refreshing scent.</li>
      <li>If you are in the market for an aquatic fresh scent I strongly suggest you head down to your local Sephora and test out Chrome Sport.</li>
      <li>When people are near you, they won&#x27;t wonder what is that spiciness on you.</li>
      <li>everywhere else a bottle like this is 80.00 to 100.00 dollars only on amazon can it be found reasonably priced</li>
      <li>The smell doesn&#x27;t last more than a few minutes.</li>
      <li>The plastic top cover has broken on both colognes</li>
      <li>It took me a while to get around to trying this EDT, mostly because i hated the original Chrome so much.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I purchased two bottles and the cologne is really good.  But the top is horrible.  The plastic top cover has broken on both colognes</li>
    <li> very good...simple but good</li>
    <li> I buy this cologne for my boyfriend all the time! He absolutly love it and so do I but it is so nice to be able to get it for a decent price as opposed to the $80 you would spend in a store like Macys for it. It smells so clean and nice!</li>
    <li> amazing and exquisit smell</li>
    <li> good price and smells very good!</li>
    <li> it is not as i was expecting but it is good price.</li>
    <li> For the size and price it was a steal. Plus the smell last all day.</li>
    <li> Bad Cologne, I thought this was gonna be an original but it turns out its more fake than 5 legged cat. Next time I&#x27;ll go to Macy&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> It took me a while to get around to trying this EDT, mostly because i hated the original Chrome so much. The metallic note in the original is nasty and takes away from the freshness of the scent. Thankfully this isn&#x27;t the case with Chrome Sport. If you are in the market for an aquatic fresh scent I strongly suggest you head down to your local Sephora and test out Chrome Sport. Not only is this EDT spray super fresh smelling but it is a unique scent and has an awesome dry down with the white musk note. Great fresh scent that you can wear all year round.</li>

    <li> Smells delicious and lasts all day long. Over 12 hours of fresh clean scent. My husband loves it. Thanks. Fast delivery and accurate. I recommend this seller 100%.</li>
    <li> This smell is amazing.</li>

    <li> I purchased this for my Fiancée and He loved it!!! I&#x27;m so happy with this product.. Its a  Fresh and clean scent!!!</li>
    <li> I was very excited about getting the Chrome Sport after trying the testers. The cologne&#x27;s metal casing around the nozzle came off. The smell doesn&#x27;t last more than a few minutes. It seems like its mixed with a lot of water.. I tested with another bottle.. Just disappointing.. Won&#x27;t buy again..</li>
    <li> great smell, fresh clean, with a hint of musk. Has become my staple scent - where 1 sprays worth most mornings and 2 or 3 when going out.</li>
    <li> Got exactly what I wanted, and shipping was fast!!</li>
    <li> Delicious, I loved it !</li>
    <li> Smells so good on my boyfriend!</li>
    <li> Smells great. Purchased as a gift for my husband for Christmas. He likes it and more importantly I like it.</li>
    <li> I bought for a friend as a gift for Christmas and he loved it he said it smells really fresh</li>
    <li> I got a few for all the men in my family. Even gals like to were this! Awesome. You know it works when several people at the same time want to wear this fragrance.</li>
    <li> It was very wonderful thank you so much</li>
    <li> Excellent cologne. I&#x27;m on my third bottle. everywhere else a bottle like this is 80.00 to 100.00 dollars only on amazon can it be found reasonably priced</li>
    <li> Great Cologne And great price&lt;br /&gt;Fast Delivery</li>
    <li> When we received the product the spray cap fell off the bottle and it was not useable. I took some pictures and sent an e-mail requesting solution. I have never heard back from the seller and Amazon. Extremely disappointed with both of them.</li>
    <li> This smell is amazing. My girl smelled it and instantly fell in love with it. It&#x27;s crisp, fresh, and breezy for any time of the year. Do not sleep on this great scent!</li>
    <li> My husband loves his chrome! I decided to order the sport for my 16yr old son to see if it was as good as JUST chrome. It&#x27;s a bit more of a summer/spring smell but he loves it &amp; such an amazing deal!!!</li>
    <li> Great service and awesome product. I was very worried at first because this was a gift for my husband but thanks to the supplier I received it on time and customer service was great Love  love the scent and he does too. Quite happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> This was a great price for this item and the size was very generous for the brands I love so much</li>
    <li> Chrome is a manly cologne, long lasting,  refreshing scent.</li>
    <li> Deliciosa fragance.Perfect to gift, excelent service</li>
    <li> I could not believe the price on this bad boy! It is REAL. No fake, not a knock-off, but the real fragrance. It smells fantastic; clean and fresh. It does not last quite as long as the original Chrome lasts, but doesnt wear off quickly by any means. Great scent.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle.  It has a nice initial kick that wakes you up in the morning and dries down to some nice warm middle notes. Not as fancy as some other designer houses, but a good fragrance for the price.</li>
    <li> Everything was good, the packaging was ok, it arrived on time. Usually the bottle in these series is defective and the silver part breaks. In this last purchase, everything was good (so far...).</li>
    <li> Seems to be very popular so I blindly bought it. Initial lemony scent reminds me of cleaning products and is a bit of a turn off. That soon fades away and you are left with a powdery, spicy, gingery smell. When people are near you, they won&#x27;t wonder what is that spiciness on you. They will know you are wearing ginger all over. For reference, the fragrance reminds me of Gold Bond Fresh scent spray (which contains ginger root extract). I&#x27;m not a big fan of this fragrance, but I might reach for it on cold winter days to project warmth.</li>
    <li> Great one. Love the smell. Very close to chanel allure homme blanche.</li>
    <li> Great price and no one can believe what I paid for it most places sell this bottle for 85 to 95 dollars</li>
    <li> Smells great, just dosen&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> Very good price, large size, and the shipping was fast. I ordered it three days before Christmas and got it the next day.</li>
