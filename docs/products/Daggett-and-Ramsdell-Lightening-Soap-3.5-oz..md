      <li>This soap is ok, I</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>but maybe the reason why i seem to be getting more pigmentation too is because maybe i should wear sunscreen with this product.</li>
      <li>but most of this had faded away when the season changed before i used this product.</li>
      <li>Maybe I will repurchase this item again and use it for like 3 months or so to really give a good review on it.</li>
      <li>I lather my face and neck really good and leave it on while bathing in the shower and then rinse really well.</li>
      <li>I am satisfied with the results that I have experienced with daily use.</li>
      <li>I really think it&#x27;s worth a try and is a great product for the cost.</li>
      <li>i  strongly feel that this soap blocks tanning.</li>
      <li>so i noticed a huge difference in that area.</li>
      <li>This by far the best lightening soap I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
      <li>which is sand beige or medium light</li>
      <li>aww its cute</li>
      <li>so smooth like baby skin.</li>
      <li>Last summer I used Dianna Stalder&#x27;s Kojic Soap without ANY results, but with the Daggett and Ramsdell soap I&#x27;ve seen great results.</li>
      <li>My face felt so smooth.</li>
      <li>I saw significant changes within a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>THIS SOAP IS VERY MILD YET EFFECTIVE IN LIGHTENING DARK MARKS AND SCARS ON YOUR SKIN AND GIVING IT A NICE, EVEN TONE.</li>
      <li>its so fair, light, white like how i use to be.</li>
      <li>it really does help your skin for the better.</li>
      <li>This will dry out your skin so lotion after but its the best thing I have used so far.</li>
      <li>This is my very first review in Amazon, which I am doing from now on for any products I purchase here at Amazon, because I think it would really help people out :) The reviews helped me</li>
      <li>other areas of the body this soap works great.</li>
      <li>and I do see results quick</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a great all-natural product to reduce freckles, tan lines, ae spots, or just to firm up your skin</li>
      <li>i think its worth trying out.</li>
      <li>I have been using this soap for a month and half with remarkable results.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always had great flawless skin, and after one use of this soap my face broke out in the worst way it ever has before.</li>
      <li>my hands had got tanned, darker than my natural light skin tone.</li>
      <li>yes i am pretty meaty in</li>
      <li>It clears my skin up, leaving it looking clear and smooth.</li>
      <li>be back for more.</li>
      <li>I did not aim to lighten up more than what was natural, but to lighten my complexion back to it&#x27;s original color.     </li>
      <li>it really does help with stretch marks, some pigmentation, smooth soft skin you will have.</li>
      <li>It is gentle on my skin and I have super sensitive skin</li>
      <li>i believe the soap is gentle for the body.</li>
      <li>why cant it just do the whole body like that.</li>
      <li>it was too much money</li>
      <li>It does take about a week or so to see results and a tip for making it work faster is to soap up your whole body and let it sit there till it drys, then rise off.</li>
      <li>Works wonders and really clears my skin.</li>
      <li>Skin bleaching soap very satisfactory.</li>
      <li>you have this soap as your body protector to help you stay light white.</li>
      <li>cant really say if this product is helping to remove it.</li>
      <li>basically my hands was burning from too much washing from dish detergent.</li>
      <li>I have been using this soap for two years I really like it</li>
      <li>so i really try to stay away from lightening or bleaching products that say wear sunscreen.</li>
      <li>that are after having three kids.my hips was in its place, not too wobly, but i rather it not had moved as much as i was walking.</li>
      <li>It really lightens your skin .</li>
      <li>my forehead and around my nose really greasy, oily.</li>
      <li>most likely laser removal cause i really want to wear white pants and show my butt more during private times.</li>
      <li>but my legs are back to their original color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and just make the whole body white or lighter all at once, not tiny spots here and there  :-)</li>
      <li>i also tan on my arms and this helped to lighten my arms back up, but my arms still need to be lightened more back to how i use to be.  </li>
      <li>arrived quickly but haven&#x27;t noticed any substancial lightening in my skin tone even though I&#x27;ve been using it daily.</li>
      <li>my stretch marks on the areas i mentioned are naturally silvery white light .</li>
      <li>and it really does lighten your skin to it natural color.</li>
      <li>During my time using it, I haven&#x27;t gotten noticeably lighter than me normal skin tone-</li>
      <li>but i most likely would need professional dermatalogist to make this area totally lighter like i should be.</li>
      <li>Just ok, no major changes noted on skin can by a little drying, does have good lathering abilities not sure about the whitening part.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this stuff...It is gentle on my skin and I have super sensitive skin and it actually lightens!  I was surprised...it&#x27;s nice, it won&#x27;t make you an unnatural weird shade, probably the lightest you can go to your natural color, it&#x27;s good at taking away dark spots and tan lines!</li>
    <li> This by far the best lightening soap I&#x27;ve used so far. Last summer I used Dianna Stalder&#x27;s Kojic Soap without ANY results, but with the Daggett and Ramsdell soap I&#x27;ve seen great results. I have been using this soap for a month and half with remarkable results. I used it to remove my annual summer tan. The key is to scrub this stuff into your skin with a sponge. For my face, I like to soap my hands up with this soap and mix in a little bit of St. Ives Apricot scrub to help the process along. Exfoliation is key. I don&#x27;t really think this soap will lighten you past your natural complexion if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for--this is why I like it personally. I did not aim to lighten up more than what was natural, but to lighten my complexion back to it&#x27;s original color.     I should mention that I am African American of a light to medium complexion. My natural undertones are gold, red, yellow and brown mixed together, however this soap makes my skin \\&quot;glow\\&quot; evenly. It&#x27;s an excellent \\&quot;brightener\\&quot;! Just be sure to use this soap with a good sunblock lotion. I use one with 50 spf.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for the past month and a half and it really does lighten your skin to it natural color. However, It takes a while ( I still have darker sunburned areas that need to be ligtened) and the lightening is uneven. For example. Part of my hands are their natural color while part of my hand is still dark from the sun. My arms have not lightened at all but my legs are back to their original color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a small area to treat this product is great but if you have a wide area that needs to be lightened just know you will have multiple colors until everything evens out.</li>
    <li> In a few days I noticed a change; it definitely has brightened my complexion and I love that it&#x27;s so gentle on the skin.</li>
    <li> I received my order on time. I tried the soap and I love it. My face felt so smooth. I look forward in purchasing more at some point</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I have sensitive skin and this soap causes breakouts therefore I can not reorder.</li>
    <li> Works wonders and really clears my skin. Love it.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a great all-natural product to reduce freckles, tan lines, ae spots, or just to firm up your skin then this is the product for you!  I love this stuff! After the birth of my son, my skin looked extremely dark.  I bought this product to try to lighten my skin a bit and because it was stated to be all-natural ingredients.  It worked and it did more than I could&#x27;ve ask for! It lightened my skin, my age spots started to disappear, and my skin got firmer.  I tried it on my tan lines and then faded away.  I&#x27;m hooked to this product now and use it everyday.  I&#x27;ve even bought some to share with my mother and she agrees that its the best skin lightening product she&#x27;s ever tried.  Give it a try and you will probably love it too.</li>
    <li> i think its worth trying out. however it makes my face greasy.  have tried a few times on my face and when i sleep and wake up my face is so greasy. my forehead and around my nose really greasy, oily. i naturally do no have oily skin. i started to mix table  salt with it to help balance it out  and it helps but it does not take the oilyness away totally. i strongly believe this soap can help your arms, hands, legs, back, and back of neck and stomach. i do not recommend for the front of the neck, it bothered me, but it may not bother you. it made my neck very uncomfortable and i felt the need to wash it with my usual dove unscented soap. and that helped a great deal. so i do not use this for the front of my neck. i also noticed that this soap broke me out on my chest area close to my breast and inbetween my breast. omg i had a few big red pimples. they was so nasty looking it just like made my chest not look so pretty, so i discontinue using it on my chest area near my breast and the pimples have been fading away. screw that never again on that area. above this area on chest i do use this soap and across my shoulders and upper front arms. my hands had got tanned, darker than my natural light skin tone. from sun exposure walking alot outside in the sun. and from using dish detergent when i wash my hands. my hands so sensitive, it began to crack alot in the winter from the dish detergent and it was very dry and brown looking. basically my hands was burning from too much washing from dish detergent. so i had damage on my hand from that. but most of this had faded away when the season changed before i used this product. i still had some tanning on my hands and when i use this soap, i feel it helped remove this darkness and discolorations from my hands completely. its so fair, light, white like how i use to be. so this is why i recommend this soap for the good that it can do. i also tan on my arms and this helped to lighten my arms back up, but my arms still need to be lightened more back to how i use to be.  but my hands on the outside is crazy light, i love it. i have naturally very light tan skin. i am multi racial. so if you have similar skin or lighter maybe this will work for you. i just hate that this soap make my face greasy but it doesnt make my body greasy. it really does help your skin for the better. it does hydrate your skin. the fact that my face was oily from it. i notice that when i use this soap. when im rinsing off with water, it seems like this soap is some sort of barrier to help skin from drying out. its as if the water just glides off my skin and the soap is keeping my skin from drying out. this is also good for being out in the sun. since it is a whitening soap, imagine washing with this and going out in the sun. yee haw. its helping to whiten skin so why am i gonna put oily sunscreen over it. its like you have this soap as your body protector to help you stay light white. so i dont feel that your whole body will get really white. but i do feel it does help to make you lighter than  you should be or lighter  like you use to be. i am buying another one of this soap today and this will be my second purchase. i still have the first soap which i am actively using it. but i dont use it everyday cause i dont have the time too. i want to note that i am a mom of 3 kids. and so i am trying to get rid of my mommy tan, years of tanning or having kids body changes, pigment changes i guess and am trying to get my lighter color back. you should buy this soap but be careful with your face. it  also put some pimples on my face. and be careful with front of your neck and middle chest area. other areas of the body this soap works great. i did not put 5 stars because it did break me out in some areas and its too oily for the face. i put 4 stars because i am still happy with the soap and thank god it was made for us to buy :-) i believe the soap is gentle for the body. it does not irritate me in the areas of the body i continue to use it. i do believe it help to make skin very soft like baby skin. so smooth like baby skin. helps to lighten stretch marks, helps to lighten some pigmentation. i have two freckle moles on my neck. they are within the skin like freckles. i swear that i remembered them being darker maybe even black or very dark brown. one little freckle under another small freckle. the little  freckle was more on the smaller side. meaning it was bigger now the little freckle is nearly gone. i saw this yesterday i was like  omg  lol like wait a minute its nearly gone and soon i wont be able to see it anymore.  at the same time i think i have notice more small moles after using this product, so i dont know if it was already there on me and i just didnt notice it, or it happened after using this product. it may not have anything to do with this product. but it is a possibility it is giving me more pigmentation like freckle like moles on my body. i dont know. for now ill continue using the product. i like it. also i notice lots of white spots on my body after using this product. why cant it just do the whole body like that. and just make the whole body white or lighter all at once, not tiny spots here and there  :-) lol. so it helped with the stretch marks i have on the outer sides of my hips and a few tiny stretch marks i have on my front upper thigh close to side of my hips. so the soap helps to even this out to blend in with the color of your skin. my stretch marks on the areas i mentioned are naturally silvery white light . they are not pink, red, dark  etc. also it helps lighten the butt back to your normal color too. i had few blemishes on my butt here and there, i barely see them. the blemishes were slightly grayish  maybe ,not really dark. also on the sides of my butt theres some discolorations and under my butt so this does help to even it out. but it has not made it go away completely. but i do believe it helped dramatically improve my butt closer to how i should be. but i most likely would need professional dermatalogist to make this area totally lighter like i should be. i also notice that this soap helped tighten my hips and under my butt area woo hoo. yes i am pretty meaty in that are after having three kids.my hips was in its place, not too wobly, but i rather it not had moved as much as i was walking. i prefered that baby fat stayed in tack lmao lol. so i noticed a huge difference in that area. seriously my hips and under neath butt area is more tight, more in shape as if i worked out. i also dont have a cra and i do walk alot so or course this keeps me in shape. and i was always a slim petite person before i had kids and while i had my three kids. my current weight is 122 lbs. i  strongly feel that this soap blocks tanning. but maybe the reason why i seem to be getting more pigmentation too is because maybe i should wear sunscreen with this product. but the product dont tell you too. so i dont worry about it. i dont use sunscreen cause its too oily even when they say not oily. so i really try to stay away from lightening or bleaching products that say wear sunscreen. i hate a greasy face and greasy body. one last thing i do have some pigmentation freckles on one side of my butt. i dont feel that this will remove this or lighten this dramatically and cant really say if this product is helping to remove it. i might need a dermatologist for that. i use to use a chemical peel in that area from a plastic surgeon and i use to pay 150.00 per month to him to  remove this. its a long process and it removed some of  the pigmentation and he stated that chemical peels are safer than laser surgery. and the laser surgery would have been about 600.00 dam lol.  but also the chemical peel made a dark circle around the freckles pigmentation on my butt. it eventually faded away on its on, but dam it made my butt in that spot darker at that time. so yeah gotta be careful with chemical peels. it was too much money so i didnt continue the treatment with the doctor. after getting alot of treatments every month. the doctor also gave me a bleaching cream to use with the chemical peel  on that spot on my butt. i am definitely going to get this professionally removed by other means. most likely laser removal cause i really want to wear white pants and show my butt more during private times. and this piss me off this pigmentation freckles on my butt. i know men dont care about it and a part of my pigmentation freckles on my butt it includes a heart shape. so im like aww its cute but i want it gone. it look like a heart shape  freckle tatoo surrounded by other freckles. hope this helps you decide if this soap is for you or not. again i do believe this soap makes you lighter, brighter, whiter. give it a try. the results dont take too long. it really does help with stretch marks, some pigmentation, smooth soft skin you will have.</li>
    <li> This is my very first review in Amazon, which I am doing from now on for any products I purchase here at Amazon, because I think it would really help people out :) The reviews helped me so I think mine would do the same for others.    This soap works a little bit. During my time using it, I haven&#x27;t gotten noticeably lighter than me normal skin tone- which is sand beige or medium light -_-  Previously, I used likas papaya soap. It&#x27;s an orange soap and it is a popular item in the Philippines. That now is reallllly GOOD and works wonders so if you want to get lighter, stray away from THIS product and search for the other one I just mentioned.     Good luck :)</li>
    <li> Did not see any results</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t ever write reviews. If I like something I just tell others, and if I don&#x27;t I trash the product. I&#x27;m a dark skin African American. I get really oily in on the upper part of my face with dark spots on my cheeks from acne scars. I&#x27;ve been using this for 4 days. My face is less oily, my tone is changing, and there is a huge difference in the dark spots.I lather my face and neck really good and leave it on while bathing in the shower and then rinse really well. I&#x27;ve been using organic coconut oil for a moisturizer and sun screen is a must during the day. My breakouts have cleared up as well. I really think it&#x27;s worth a try and is a great product for the cost.</li>
    <li> This is a great product to use it smells good, Feels great on your skin, I will order more and would recomment this&lt;br /&gt;Product to anyone that need some greatness and the promise of what it says . It feels beautiful and it do work. Its&lt;br /&gt;Great, thank you.</li>
    <li> Awful. Save your money</li>
    <li> Skin bleaching soap very satisfactory.</li>
    <li> i like it... works good.. but it made me break out all over!!! so i cant use it</li>
    <li> I started using it on my face to lighten my complexion and it don&#x27;t even lighten the skin! It broke out my face and it leaves red bumps.</li>
    <li> I am using this products to get rid of some dark spots in my face. The product feels nice on my skin and I have yet to see results but it is a work in progress.</li>
    <li> It really lightens your skin . I&#x27;ve been going to every beautiful supply to find this soap and I haven&#x27;t but finally I found it on amazon!! I love this soap is lightens &amp; brightens my skin. After using this soap for 3 days . Ppl have said I&#x27;ve had a glow!! It&#x27;s perfect I love it .</li>
    <li> I bought this soap with the intentions of lightening the blemishes on my face and it did just that. It brightens the skin, leaving your skin radiant as well. I saw significant changes within a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to Use:&lt;br /&gt;Use strictly for face or entire body to even out skin tone. Use an exfoliating buff puff and leave soap on face/body for a few moments before rinsing off. Use daily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a light skinned black women and I recently moved to Florida. Everyday I&#x27;m constantly in the sun and was getting tired of not being my natural color. This is a great inexpensive product.It helped get rid of my tan also lightend up my under arms and some hyperpigmentation spots from shaving. This will dry out your skin so lotion after but its the best thing I have used so far. It does take about a week or so to see results and a tip for making it work faster is to soap up your whole body and let it sit there till it drys, then rise off. I use it everyday and I do see results quick but I always end up getting tan again because of the sun but it keeps me from getting darker.</li>
    <li> Just ok, no major changes noted on skin can by a little drying, does have good lathering abilities not sure about the whitening part.</li>
    <li> Works great on age spots, and evens skin tone. Is compatible with my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> arrived quickly but haven&#x27;t noticed any substancial lightening in my skin tone even though I&#x27;ve been using it daily.</li>
    <li> THIS SOAP IS VERY MILD YET EFFECTIVE IN LIGHTENING DARK MARKS AND SCARS ON YOUR SKIN AND GIVING IT A NICE, EVEN TONE.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  Have used it before for a long time; originally found in a catalog but cannot find it now.&lt;br /&gt;It acts slowly, but it DOES keep my hands looking much better.&lt;br /&gt;Will be back for more.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for two years I really like it thats all I used to wash my face with it does what it says it will do.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it really work, it dried my skin out, so I stopped using it within 5 days of use.</li>
    <li> I did see a difference in the tone of my skin color but not that much being that I only purchased 1 bar. Maybe I will repurchase this item again and use it for like 3 months or so to really give a good review on it.</li>
    <li> This soap is ok, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;It will not really lighten your skin, but make it glow.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t continue to use it, your skin will re-darken.</li>
    <li> This product it awesome!  Its legit. Used it for a week..and let me tell you honey child its the truth. Cant wait to buy another bar.  Its not a bleach but it lightens you. Make sure you put lotion on after you shower. My skin feels ooo-la-la</li>
    <li> I use this soap to get rid of my acne scars. It washes off nicely and doesn&#x27;t cause any additional blemishes. It clears my skin up, leaving it looking clear and smooth. I no longer wear make up to cover anything.</li>
    <li> This soap wasn&#x27;t too spectacular. It smells kind of like cinnamon or something, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any skin lightening. Biggest problem? DO NOT USE ON FACE. I&#x27;ve always had great flawless skin, and after one use of this soap my face broke out in the worst way it ever has before. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d recommend this to anybody.</li>
    <li> The product works for uneven skin tones.  I am satisfied with the results that I have experienced with daily use.</li>
    <li> I use the soap on my legs because my legs get very dark. My legs get dark but all I do is put soap on my legs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m guessing it must take a while to work, cause i was using it for a month and nothing happened. It just made my face really DRY...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but everyone is different so it might work for someone else.</li>
