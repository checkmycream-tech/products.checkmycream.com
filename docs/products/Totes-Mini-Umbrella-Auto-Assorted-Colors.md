<li> It is small and relatively lightweight and holds up in bad weather.</li>
<li> When they say assorted colors, that means you get the color they send you and expect the worse.</li>

    <li> I went to local stores looking for one of these. I found them at Kohl&#x27;s on sale for over $20! This one is very good-looking, works great and fits in a school bookbag. The fellow I bought it for loves it.</li>
    <li> All three items as described!  good deal!  I bought for several family members and they are very happy with their gifts.</li>

    <li> I did not like this at ALL..I bought it for my son and it was like a freakin rainbow!!! He obviously wouldn&#x27;t walk around with it and even I wouldn&#x27;t SOOOOOOO because I have so little free time and haven&#x27;t sent it back/ I guess I will save it for the unwanted guest and hope that it stays with them.</li>
    <li> Good for the price. A little flimsy but the price reflected the quality to be expected. The spring action button works to open it. Make sure you hold it away from face when you open it, it unfurls very well. LOL</li>
