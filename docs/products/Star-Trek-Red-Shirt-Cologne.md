      <li>Turns out it smells awesome.</li>
      <li>This cologne is perfect.  </li>
      <li>This \\&quot;toy\\&quot; lol is excellent.</li>
      <li>But since I can&#x27;t detect the smell of lavender at all I&#x27;m really happy &amp; my Hubby smells great!  </li>
      <li>It smells great, my fiance loves it</li>
      <li>the description does not do this justice great for any occasion, and for any person not just the nerd at heart</li>
      <li>It smells good.</li>
      <li>Cologne is just not that good.</li>
      <li>The size of the bottle is good for the price I paid.</li>
      <li>He LOVED it, and to my surprise so do I.  </li>
      <li>It smells GREAT, way better than I think him</li>
      <li>So glad I did!</li>
      <li>A keepsake for sure!</li>
      <li>I would recommend this scent out of all the Trek colognes, as I own all three, so</li>
      <li>I am very satisfied with this purchase and will be ordering more when I run out.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cool lol.</li>
      <li>I have received many complements from the ladies.</li>
      <li>Sure he says he&#x27;s Scottish, but you&#x27;d think he&#x27;s Romulan.</li>
      <li>This cologne really does smell great.</li>
      <li>Oh and I love telling them its Star Trek cologne when they ask what about it.</li>
      <li>This is much better than the shirtless Kirk, almost like an Abercrombie and Fitch fragrance.</li>
      <li>Mostly bought it for the bottle.</li>
      <li>My boyfriend loves Star Trek, so I got this cologne for him, more as a joke than anything.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not the only one who thinks this, but anyone who catches the scent remarks how wonderful it smells.</li>
      <li>We both love how it smells.</li>
      <li>and I must say I was surprised how good it is!  </li>
      <li>I think the scent is great too and can&#x27;t get enough of him when he wears it  :-)</li>
      <li>Strong without being overpowering.</li>
      <li>I purchased two of these for my brother and a friend, both of which are huge Star Trek fans.</li>
      <li>If I bought this scent in a store in a blank bottle, I&#x27;d be happy with it.</li>
      <li>Trek geek is going to enjoy having the bottle, if nothing else.</li>
      <li>if you&#x27;re on the fence about any of them trust me: Red Shirt is great.</li>
      <li>It has a sweet, citrus smell combined with a hint of muskiness but, not too overpowering.</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend this to any Star Trek fan who wants to smell good :)</li>
      <li>He just loves it, the cool packaging and the scent.  </li>
      <li>It has the punch-in-the-nose smell of opening a true cedar chest and getting a blast of that in your face, softened with a slightly sweet scent.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is seriously the best smelling cologne i&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
      <li>Red Shirt arrived first, and I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I was pleasantly surprised because the cologne actually smells pretty good!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how to describe the scent except for it being calm, yet powerful when you do smell it.  </li>
      <li>It really does smell nice, fresh, citrusy, and young.</li>
      <li>It actually smells quite nice.  </li>
      <li>I have both Red Shirt and Tiberius and I must say Red Shirt is by far the best smelling.  </li>
      <li>Despite all the hype about Star Trek nowadays this cologne actually has a respectable fragrance.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The scent is in the higher ranges, with a sharpness to it that reminds me of Stetson cologne.</li>
      <li>&quot; Hey, if anything, if you are a Star Trek fan, I suggest for the price giving this a shot if you are unsure on the fragrance, because if anything, the glass container would look really awesome on your collectible shelf inbetween your Enterprise and phaser replicas.</li>
      <li>My husband is a Trekkie, and when his first Father&#x27;s Day rolled around this year, I just had no clue what to get him.</li>
      <li>I saw where other people liked it</li>
      <li>It kind of smells like some other brand</li>
      <li>I love the new Red Shirt Cologne.</li>
      <li>I gave myself a little spray of the stuff, and I surprisingly liked it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s about as much as I can do to describe a smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have not used very many colognes in the past.  </li>
      <li>and I was a new man!</li>
      <li>The most previous one I used before this was Reaction by Kenneth Cole.  </li>
      <li>(mainly cause I&#x27;m a Trekkie).  </li>
      <li>Their reactions have been classic.</li>
      <li>I got it mainly for the geek factor..</li>
      <li>Red shirt, on the other hand has a nice manly smell.  </li>
      <li>It went very smoothly and came earlier than expected.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got a nice subtle smell that will make any Axe-wearing teenager look like a preening peacock by comparison.</li>
      <li>But for me, someone who does not wear cologne it smells a little too strong.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great smelling and long lasting and it costs about half of lesser name brand scents.  </li>
      <li>matter, Red Shirt Cologne has opened up a whole new world for me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a sophisticated scent that is reminiscent of much more expensive colognes at a much lesser price plus it has conversation piece value.    </li>
      <li>lol I just like knowing there&#x27;s a cologne I can put on for special events and not feel sick by the end of the day!</li>
      <li>Most of those led to me getting sick from the heavy smell or no longer found the scent pleasant.  </li>
      <li>If you have some extra money to spare, are a Trekkie, and need a good cologne you could do a lot worse than Red Shirt.     </li>
      <li>We bought it for his Dad &amp; now he wants a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;The trek statements on the back of the box were a big hit too.</li>
      <li>Live long and prosper.</li>

<li> and I both expected, and</li>
<li> Transporter leaves in a few minutes, but I&#x27;ll be back to tell you how it went.&lt;br</li>
<li> He&#x27;s not into your typical manly Father&#x27;s Day gifts and every other \\&quot;nerd\\&quot; item he wanted was a little too pricey for the timing, but I ran across this and for the price, considering it is an actual cologne</li>
<li> After reading other reviews I decided to give it a try..</li>
<li> but I was skeptical about buying cologne without sampling it first.  </li>

<li> Like with all other cologne, I assumed I will be feeling a little queezy from the scent or not like the scent by the end of the day.  </li>
<li> Considering the other colognes he likes cost upward of $80 a bottle, this is a steal!</li>
<li> Although difficult to describe the smell, most ladies I know of tend to compliment me on this choice of cologne, and if they only knew the dirty secret that it was Star Trek based cologne!  </li>
<li> Not sure where I have smelled this cologne somewhere before.</li>
<li> So it&#x27;s been a full day, and I haven&#x27;t felt sick or grown tired of the scent!  </li>
<li> Figured worst case scenario I hadn&#x27;t spent a whole lot on a collectible item.</li>
<li> always has that shrill tone in his accent too.</li>
<li> For the price compared to other colognes, it isn&#x27;t too overly bad.  </li>
<li> You could do worse!</li>
<li> I was a litte nervous about the smell since the product description mentioned lavender notes, because I hate the smell of lavender &amp; would never want my man to smell like my grandmas underware drawer.</li>
<li> and I haven&#x27;t died a horrible death yet.    </li>

    <li> I&#x27;m a Trek geek, so when I saw the colognes, I knew I was going to get them. Red Shirt arrived first, and I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is in the higher ranges, with a sharpness to it that reminds me of Stetson cologne. It has the punch-in-the-nose smell of opening a true cedar chest and getting a blast of that in your face, softened with a slightly sweet scent.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s about as much as I can do to describe a smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any Trek geek is going to enjoy having the bottle, if nothing else. But the cologne is what I call a \\&quot;justifiable purchase\\&quot;. If I bought this scent in a store in a blank bottle, I&#x27;d be happy with it. And hey! I am.</li>
    <li> This is much better than the shirtless Kirk, almost like an Abercrombie and Fitch fragrance.</li>
    <li> I got this for my Hubby as a joke since he is a geek.  He LOVED it, and to my surprise so do I.  It actually smells quite nice.  I was a litte nervous about the smell since the product description mentioned lavender notes, because I hate the smell of lavender &amp; would never want my man to smell like my grandmas underware drawer. But since I can&#x27;t detect the smell of lavender at all I&#x27;m really happy &amp; my Hubby smells great!  Remember, if you don&#x27;t get in a fight while wearing it, you&#x27;re just not wearing enough.</li>
    <li> Growing up, I was never big on cologne and tried several types throughout the years.  Most of those led to me getting sick from the heavy smell or no longer found the scent pleasant.  So I thought I would try the Red Shirt cologne (mainly cause I&#x27;m a Trekkie).  I gave myself a little spray of the stuff, and I surprisingly liked it.  Like with all other cologne, I assumed I will be feeling a little queezy from the scent or not like the scent by the end of the day.  So it&#x27;s been a full day, and I haven&#x27;t felt sick or grown tired of the scent!  I don&#x27;t know how to describe the scent except for it being calm, yet powerful when you do smell it.  lol I just like knowing there&#x27;s a cologne I can put on for special events and not feel sick by the end of the day!</li>
    <li> My husband is a Trekkie, and when his first Father&#x27;s Day rolled around this year, I just had no clue what to get him. He&#x27;s not into your typical manly Father&#x27;s Day gifts and every other \\&quot;nerd\\&quot; item he wanted was a little too pricey for the timing, but I ran across this and for the price, considering it is an actual cologne, I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. It smells GREAT, way better than I think him and I both expected, and I will quote him here, \\&quot;This is going to be the only cologne I wear now for as long as they make it!\\&quot; Hey, if anything, if you are a Star Trek fan, I suggest for the price giving this a shot if you are unsure on the fragrance, because if anything, the glass container would look really awesome on your collectible shelf inbetween your Enterprise and phaser replicas. A keepsake for sure!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves Star Trek, so I got this cologne for him, more as a joke than anything. Turns out it smells awesome. I have reordered it for him numerous times. Considering the other colognes he likes cost upward of $80 a bottle, this is a steal!</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these for my brother and a friend, both of which are huge Star Trek fans. I got it mainly for the geek factor.. but I was pleasantly surprised because the cologne actually smells pretty good! Everyone that smelled it seemed to like it. I would definitely recommend this to any Star Trek fan who wants to smell good :)</li>
    <li> I bought a bottle of this at the convention in Las Vegas.  It smells great, my fiance loves it and I haven&#x27;t died a horrible death yet.    It&#x27;s a great smelling and long lasting and it costs about half of lesser name brand scents.  Pick up a bottle.....if you dare.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend is an Television Engineer and a Trekkie.  This cologne is perfect.  He just loves it, the cool packaging and the scent.  I think the scent is great too and can&#x27;t get enough of him when he wears it  :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve known of this cologne for some time now being a Trekkie.  I saw where other people liked it but I was skeptical about buying cologne without sampling it first.  Just got it today for my birthday and I must say I was surprised how good it is!  It has a sweet, citrus smell combined with a hint of muskiness but, not too overpowering. The bottle was different than what was in the picture but you still get a generous amount for what you pay!</li>
    <li> This cologne really does smell great. Husband says it reminds him of Red Bull (sort of). We bought it for his Dad &amp; now he wants a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;The trek statements on the back of the box were a big hit too.</li>
    <li> I love the new Red Shirt Cologne. For the longest time I was just another chump in Engineering listening to the barking commands of Lt. Scott, \\&quot;Adjust those phase inverters!\\&quot; Or, \\&quot;Monitor those inertial dampeners!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He always has that shrill tone in his accent too. Sure he says he&#x27;s Scottish, but you&#x27;d think he&#x27;s Romulan. Besides, a man from Scottland with the last name Scott? Talk about lack of imagination! It&#x27;s probably made up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter, Red Shirt Cologne has opened up a whole new world for me. After my purchase I finally had the courage to ask for that transfer to Security. One splash and I was a new man! Even the Captain noticed. He&#x27;s asked me to go on an away mission to the surface of Taurus II with him!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, gotta run. Transporter leaves in a few minutes, but I&#x27;ll be back to tell you how it went.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Red Shirt Cologne!</li>
    <li> If you have some extra money to spare, are a Trekkie, and need a good cologne you could do a lot worse than Red Shirt.     It&#x27;s got a nice subtle smell that will make any Axe-wearing teenager look like a preening peacock by comparison. It&#x27;s a sophisticated scent that is reminiscent of much more expensive colognes at a much lesser price plus it has conversation piece value.    I would recommend this scent out of all the Trek colognes, as I own all three, so if you&#x27;re on the fence about any of them trust me: Red Shirt is great.</li>
    <li> This \\&quot;toy\\&quot; lol is excellent. The size of the bottle is good for the price I paid. It smells good. I have received many complements from the ladies. Oh and I love telling them its Star Trek cologne when they ask what about it. Their reactions have been classic. Now about the delivery. It went very smoothly and came earlier than expected. I am very satisfied with this purchase and will be ordering more when I run out. So Trekie, non Trekie buy this. Live long and prosper.</li>
    <li> Despite all the hype about Star Trek nowadays this cologne actually has a respectable fragrance.  I have both Red Shirt and Tiberius and I must say Red Shirt is by far the best smelling.  Not only is it just my opinion, but several of the ladies as well.</li>
    <li> I have not used very many colognes in the past.  The most previous one I used before this was Reaction by Kenneth Cole.  I didn&#x27;t like that one because I don&#x27;t like to go around all day smelling like food!  Red shirt, on the other hand has a nice manly smell.  Although difficult to describe the smell, most ladies I know of tend to compliment me on this choice of cologne, and if they only knew the dirty secret that it was Star Trek based cologne!  For the price compared to other colognes, it isn&#x27;t too overly bad.  You could do worse! Like pay $70 for a bottle of Kenneth Cole Reaction that makes you smell like apples all day.</li>
    <li> Not sure where I have smelled this cologne somewhere before. It kind of smells like some other brand that I can not put my fingertips on. But for me, someone who does not wear cologne it smells a little too strong. Maybe if I wear it enough I will get used to the cologne smells. But over-all it is not too strong and it is, nor fruity, nor a bad smell. So I like it</li>
    <li> For my son, who scarfed the bottle I bought last year for his dad. It really does smell nice, fresh, citrusy, and young.</li>
    <li> the description does not do this justice great for any occasion, and for any person not just the nerd at heart</li>
    <li> This is seriously the best smelling cologne i&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;m not the only one who thinks this, but anyone who catches the scent remarks how wonderful it smells.</li>
    <li> Just as the headline says. It&#x27;s MEH. Cologne is just not that good. Mostly bought it for the bottle. It&#x27;s cool lol.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend who is a big Trekkie. I was concerned about how it would smell since I couldn&#x27;t try it out ahead of time and he can be picky about cologne. After reading other reviews I decided to give it a try.. Figured worst case scenario I hadn&#x27;t spent a whole lot on a collectible item. So glad I did! We both love how it smells. It has a manly fragrance - woody and citrusy. Strong without being overpowering. Very happy with this purchase!</li>
