      <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know if this is glue or water...</li>

      <li>really love it</li>
      <li>glad I made this purchase</li>
      <li>Well my daughter is in love with doing her nails.</li>
      <li>it was an okay product</li>
      <li>I will be ordering more as soon as I see if I get them.</li>
      <li>WILL DEF buy from this seller again, but will make sure i get it before i run out of it, cause it took a month to arrive.</li>
      <li>I love the glue</li>
      <li>u can buy one for like... more than this at the store</li>
      <li>Better than glue that comes with the nails.</li>
      <li>great, cheap, and it came early too!!!!</li>
      <li>I very happy an it was so cheap, the blue sticks</li>
      <li>GOOD NAIL GLUE, DRIES FAST.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>some weren&#x27;t fully filled and very sticky and only squeeze lightly!!!!!</li>
      <li>This glue is great, but it doesn&#x27;t keep in the bottle, so if your tryng to save it for later after opening, your out of luck</li>
      <li>Lol.. I will know next time!</li>
      <li>glue material is cheap.  </li>
      <li>make sure you have some nail polish remover near by:) helps with slip ups.</li>
      <li>It came quickly and was well</li>
      <li>Cheap and ship fast!</li>
      <li>I received super fast, and they work perfectly fine.</li>
      <li>I used a full nail, though, instead of a tip as indicated in the product title which might be why my experience wasn&#x27;t stellar.</li>
      <li>this glue bonds a bit faster than the ones I&#x27;m used to, but that may just be getting more experienced in using it.&lt;br /&gt;However, it gets VERY hot for a few second when it dries, like a burning feel hot!</li>
      <li>Like I said, it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted</li>
      <li>I could find better but not for the same price.</li>
      <li>but it came on exact estmated date.</li>
      <li>i do realize it was coming from japan and was just before Christmas, but I didn&#x27;t get these much before i moved in March!</li>
      <li>I use full coverage nails and it holds better than any other adhesive I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
      <li>So be mindful of user error and not just blaming the glue for not being effective when it&#x27;s possible that you aren&#x27;t using it to its full potential.</li>
      <li>HAHAHAHA</li>
      <li>really like the nail glue, and it works really well.</li>
      <li>it comes with so much</li>
      <li>really well i jave already used it.</li>
      <li>I like for the price....not much in each tube....get what you pay for though....</li>
      <li>to much and wont stick</li>
      <li>It was packaged well and shipped fast.</li>
      <li>These work very well</li>
      <li>This glue really holds the decorations  </li>
      <li>what more can I say other than it works</li>
      <li>I saved my fingers from being stuck together but my hand looked 1,000 years old for a whole day!</li>
      <li>it only last about three, but these i&#x27;m going on 7 :DD only thing is, the picture looks like the kind</li>
      <li>These are better than others that I have used in the past.</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive nails, get glue then dries cooler!</li>
      <li>if you have been using the normal glue at the regular local stores or pharmacies, this GLUE works way way better, sticks right away and stayed glued for a long long time!</li>
      <li>They leaked all over the place and made a huge mess.  </li>
      <li>Also it helps to buff the nail surface a bit with a coarse file to create a smooth dry surface since nail beds have natural oils on them which will keep the glue from bonding correctly.</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
      <li>Lasted super tight for days until I could get to the salon.  </li>
      <li>So be careful when you place your fake nail tip on your real nail, make sure you have it well placed because once it touches the real nail</li>
      <li>This is not pink gel glue.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m sure it works on false nails too..</li>
      <li>2x cause they were going quick from a few different sellers,</li>
      <li>Its okay for the price but slow to dry</li>

<li> Nails last for.a very long long long long long long long long long long time.</li>
<li> it a long long time to ship out and then took even longer to get to me.</li>
<li> This glues seem to last longer than the any other brand..</li>
<li> It&#x27;s the regular thin clear nail glue that you can pick up anywhere.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t get curious like me and unscrew it.</li>

<li> NOT WORTH IT</li>
<li> Its not worth it.</li>
<li> and it was a waste of money</li>
<li> Tried this glue with natural colored artificial nails and it didn&#x27;t seem very pink.</li>
<li> But they did give us an extra to say sorry.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure how people are saying this doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
<li> usually with the glue i buy from the store</li>
<li> AND SOME OF THE GLUE HAD ALREADY FORMED A HARD CRUST</li>
<li> The other day one of my artificial nails started to lift and I glued it down with this glue.  </li>
<li> I feel like maybe they just got a bad batch of old glue.</li>
<li> it sucks.</li>
<li> Two week hold, at least.</li>
<li> Also had a difficult time getting the glue out and it didn&#x27;t spread over the nail bed as I laid each nail down, leaving pockets of unglued nail.</li>
<li> lately shes been into false nails.</li>
<li> PLEASE DON&#x27;T WASTE UR MONEY!!!</li>

    <li> I used this glue to do my nails one time. When I went to do my nails again 3 months later, all the glue had dried up even the unopened bottles the glue had dried up and the were wrapped in the bubbled packaging</li>
    <li> Yay!  Cheap and ship fast!</li>
    <li> this glue doesn&#x27;t work. It doesn&#x27;t stick at all. it sucks. does not work can sit forever and still doesn&#x27;;t stick</li>
    <li> I like for the price....not much in each tube....get what you pay for though.... no complaints.... It is what I ordered. It was packaged well and shipped fast. I would buy from again and recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> They took forever and a day to arrive. Which is typical for amazon, but the quality is decent. I could find better but not for the same price. All and all it was an okay product</li>
    <li> Great quality. I use full coverage nails and it holds better than any other adhesive I&#x27;ve bought. Two week hold, at least. I wish I would have found these sooner.</li>
    <li> Tried this glue with natural colored artificial nails and it didn&#x27;t seem very pink. I used a full nail, though, instead of a tip as indicated in the product title which might be why my experience wasn&#x27;t stellar. Also had a difficult time getting the glue out and it didn&#x27;t spread over the nail bed as I laid each nail down, leaving pockets of unglued nail. I ended up switching to a different glue to finish my manicure. The nails that I did glue with this product have stayed perfectly.</li>
    <li> Like I said, it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted and I used it. It was excellent. Perfect for 3D nail art.</li>
    <li> It came quickly and was well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the nail glue, and it works really well. Theres a lot and it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im glad I made this purchase and I recommend it for anyone.</li>
    <li> this glue just.... stays on forever. i had ordered fimo sticks and each slice stays on for days upon days. usually with the glue i buy from the store it only last about three, but these i&#x27;m going on 7 :DD only thing is, the picture looks like the kind i but from the store, so you don&#x27;t get that glue, you get better ones.</li>
    <li> got it was in good shape love it happy to use it and much more of it thank so much</li>
    <li> These suck, save your money.  They leaked all over the place and made a huge mess.  I ended up throwing them all away.</li>
    <li> this glue bonds a bit faster than the ones I&#x27;m used to, but that may just be getting more experienced in using it.&lt;br /&gt;However, it gets VERY hot for a few second when it dries, like a burning feel hot! If you have sensitive nails, get glue then dries cooler!</li>
    <li> this product works great! if you have been using the normal glue at the regular local stores or pharmacies, this GLUE works way way better, sticks right away and stayed glued for a long long time! So be careful when you place your fake nail tip on your real nail, make sure you have it well placed because once it touches the real nail, it&#x27;s glued and it&#x27;s impossible to move it around cause the glue is that good lol. WILL DEF buy from this seller again, but will make sure i get it before i run out of it, cause it took a month to arrive.</li>
    <li> stays on well. some weren&#x27;t fully filled and very sticky and only squeeze lightly!!!!! OMG! make sure you have some nail polish remover near by:) helps with slip ups. holds decorations well. i&#x27;m sure it works on false nails too.. also good for decorating phone cases and the like.  it a long long time to ship out and then took even longer to get to me. i do realize it was coming from japan and was just before Christmas, but I didn&#x27;t get these much before i moved in March! LOL...mnths.. so just beware. and if don&#x27;t be in a hurry! I wanted these for Christmas and tried to order them 2x cause they were going quick from a few different sellers, Lol.. I will know next time!</li>
    <li> This glue is a reflection of the price. Its not worth it. It doesn&#x27;t hold or adhere to anything. A little disappointed</li>
    <li> Great price great shipping</li>
    <li> glue material is cheap.  plus after  you cut it open it still drips all the glue out onto the cap.</li>
    <li> I ORDERED THESE BECAUSE I SAW A NAIL TECHNICIAN USE IT BUT THIS IS SO NOT WORTH IT I LITERALLY HAD TO USE A TUBE PER NAIL AND SOME OF THE GLUE HAD ALREADY FORMED A HARD CRUST BEFORE I EVEN OPENED THEM</li>
    <li> I would definitely order this glue again.</li>
    <li> It seemed like a good deal but turned out to be a dud.  Very disappointed with the purchase and would not recommend.</li>
    <li> they are perfect for acrylics nails they super glue very well ! really love it thank you !!!</li>
    <li> I do my own acrylic nails and I use 3d nail art this is the only glue I ever use I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s nail glue....what more can I say other than it works</li>
    <li> there great I will be ordering more as soon as I see if I get them. I love the glue</li>
    <li> They all came, it felt like forever but it came on exact estmated date. I very happy an it was so cheap, the blue sticks really well i jave already used it. A definitely good buy!</li>
    <li> Nails last for.a very long long long long long long long long long long time. purchase the glue please please</li>
    <li> Awesome glue and sets fast!</li>
    <li> I received super fast, and they work perfectly fine. I&#x27;m not sure how people are saying this doesn&#x27;t work. I feel like maybe they just got a bad batch of old glue. But my glue is bonding nicely. Also it helps to buff the nail surface a bit with a coarse file to create a smooth dry surface since nail beds have natural oils on them which will keep the glue from bonding correctly. So be mindful of user error and not just blaming the glue for not being effective when it&#x27;s possible that you aren&#x27;t using it to its full potential.</li>
    <li> if everybody is looking for excellent glue fingrs brush on gle is soooooooo amazing</li>
    <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know if this is glue or water...This glue is worse than the fake nail glue they sell at drugstores! I used to this glue to re-attach one of my acrylics that had fallen off, and it fell off again after about 5 seconds. Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> to much and wont stick</li>
    <li> Better than glue that comes with the nails. Stick longer too.</li>
    <li> This was a gift, the items are very good.</li>
    <li> This is not pink gel glue. It&#x27;s the regular thin clear nail glue that you can pick up anywhere. The tubes had screw on bottoms. Don&#x27;t get curious like me and unscrew it. All the glue poured out in my hand! I saved my fingers from being stuck together but my hand looked 1,000 years old for a whole day!</li>
    <li> This stuff works well.  The other day one of my artificial nails started to lift and I glued it down with this glue.  Lasted super tight for days until I could get to the salon.  I also decorate my nails with sequins, beads and Fimo slices.  This glue really holds the decorations  I recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This glue is great, but it doesn&#x27;t keep in the bottle, so if your tryng to save it for later after opening, your out of luck</li>
    <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED THIS IS A JOKE!!!! DOESN&#x27;T HOLD NO GOOD FOR A PROFESSIONAL OR A BEGINNER PLEASE DON&#x27;T WASTE UR MONEY!!!</li>
    <li> This is the worst product I have the glue was all the way in the plastic bag I will not recommended this product is cost me almost 6 dollars and it was a waste of money</li>
    <li> Im happy. Product came and packaged well.</li>
    <li> GOOD NAIL GLUE, DRIES FAST.</li>
    <li> Its okay for the price but slow to dry</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Came with all of them. And have plenty to do multiple setsof nails with.</li>
    <li> Well my daughter is in love with doing her nails. lately shes been into false nails. Shes 11 and she ordered this and she loved it. Her only complaint is that was not fast shipping. But they did give us an extra to say sorry. But overall she loves it!</li>
    <li> great, cheap, and it came early too!!!! BUY IT HAHAHAHA u can buy one for like... more than this at the store</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried them yet because they are part of a Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> it comes with so much I will never run out of the product its an amazing glue. once I run out I will repurchase it.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my daughter.. This glues seem to last longer than the any other brand.. I bought several packs.. When I get low I will be reordering them!!</li>
    <li> These work very well and they actually stick for days. These are better than others that I have used in the past.</li>
