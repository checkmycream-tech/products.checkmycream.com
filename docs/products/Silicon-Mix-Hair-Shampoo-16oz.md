    <li> I saw all the reviews on YouTube and decided to give it a try I bought mine on a bundle deal so I got the shampoo and the 16oz silicon mix I tried this first on a weave that I was going to give up on it WAS AMAZING! so then I tried the shampoo on my natural hair it was very drying so this is now my fave weave shampoo</li>
    <li> I immediately could feel the difference in this shampoo as I was washing my hair. It completely cleaned my hair while elongating my curls. I loved the way it made my hair feel while washing. Looking forward to my next hair wash!</li>
    <li> I have order  shampoo twice.  I love being able to order what I need for the year, especially.  I don&#x27;t have to go out to shop for what I need.  It is delivered to my door. And I am good until the next time I order.</li>

    <li> It is GREAT on my extensions and smell is awesome and last for days!  I also purchsed the Silicon Mix Hair Treatment.</li>
    <li> i feel the difference immediately after I start washing my hair. It feels stronger almost immediately. Like, how is that possible? Amazing product def recommended.</li>
    <li> This produce was very drying to my hair I did not like it I will be giving this away</li>
    <li> I have used this product for some time now and I like that it makes my hair soft and hydrated.</li>
    <li> Use this after your regular conditioner to seal the moisture on. Excellent product. Wonderful hydrated hair. Worth every penny. Buy it.</li>
    <li> This product is great. It moisturized my hair immediately and left my hair silky soft and clean. It smells like the Silicon Mix Treatment but with a lighter scent. The texture of this shampoo is extremely thick and moisture filled. You Only need a little because of the thickness. I love this shampoo and can&#x27;t live without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it to any one who have dry-brittle thick falling out hair. Silicon Mix Intensive shampoo does a great job to living up to its name. Follow-up with Silicon Mix Treatment you will love your hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter liked how the shampoo worked,  Also bought the deep hair treatment with this product.  She feels her hair isbetter.</li>
    <li> Love silicon mix products. I have been using them for years. The price is very reasonable I usually pay more for this size.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has sulfate which can ruin your keratin treatment. I tried to ask questions but the seller never responded. So I am requesting a refund because I can not use this product. I have a keratin treatment in my hair. I wish they would have listed the complete ingredients.</li>
    <li> Hands down one of my favorite shampoos that I use. It works great with the conditioner.gives you that salon feeling</li>
    <li> Highly recommend. Great product. I have used other products similiar to this particular product, but find that this product works great.</li>
    <li> Only a few drops will do wonders and leaves your hair and scalp feeling clean. Nice  pleasant scent.</li>
