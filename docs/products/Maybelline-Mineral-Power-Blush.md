      <li>But in general a very good product.</li>
      <li>Comes in a cute container and don&#x27;t need a huge amount of blush to look adorable in your makeup.</li>
      <li>The color is very bright pink.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a very bright pink.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too light .</li>
      <li>I love the illuminator and figured I&#x27;d love the blush as well, but the pink in this blush is REALLY bright.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s goes on so smooth</li>
      <li>but it  is no longer available in the stores.  </li>
      <li>it is light</li>
      <li>and looks more fresh like.</li>
      <li>Enjoy</li>
      <li>BUT ONE AVAILABLE</li>

      <li>but if you want its worth a try :)</li>
      <li>There is a pretty sparkle to it and good coverage and also stays on very well, but I found that I broke out from it a lot.</li>
      <li>You just need a small amount and it looks wonderful!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of clear for me.</li>
      <li>But overall satisfied with the product and would buy again :)</li>
      <li>and it goes on very smooth not choppy like my bronzed.great buy will buy again</li>
      <li>It has the right amount of color and shimmer without being glittery..</li>
      <li>It has a really pretty glow to it and looks nice on my skin, especially in photos.</li>
      <li>These are nice little pots of color - if you like wearing blush you may like some of the other shades offered like original rose.</li>
      <li>This is an amazing pink color.  </li>
      <li>itd be a soft smooth color</li>
      <li>If any one wants a good blush, I recommend you to use maybeline&#x27;s gentle pink.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m fair skin, blonde hair, blue eyes and this shade works for me all year around!</li>
      <li>I cant say too much for the price because its not expensive</li>
      <li>I love this blush and its a pretty pink color.</li>
      <li>The color is more like a dark pink rose</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a gorgeous shade of pink and you can go as light or as dark as you want to.</li>
      <li>I am very dissapointed that it didn&#x27;t come with a brush, because I was under the impression that it would.</li>
      <li>If pink is your color then you better buy this blush.</li>
      <li>It is not that hot pink or light to were you can see it.</li>
      <li>last all say, doesn&#x27;t look old or smudged, easy to apply (with a brush).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I recommend it to anyone that doesnt like hot red blush.</li>
      <li>such a pretty color</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a sweet pink but</li>
      <li>This blush would probably look fantastic on someone with Olive-toned or black skin.  </li>
      <li>Love it that it has a little bit of sparkle!!</li>
      <li>I have extremely pale skin, so it really stands out, but if I just use a very small amount and blend it, I think it looks pretty nice.</li>

    <li> I bought this product through amazon.com. I am very happy with the  product and the quality of the product is excellent.</li>
    <li> This product is really nice on your cheeks. The only reason i knocked off one star is because it looks lighter in the picture. The color is more like a dark pink rose</li>
    <li> Ok i bought this blush like 4 months ago and is really nice it covers nicely on your cheeks.  Comes in a cute container and don&#x27;t need a huge amount of blush to look adorable in your makeup. Kind of expected it to be a little larger than it really was which i was a little disappointed with but its ok . But overall satisfied with the product and would buy again :)</li>
    <li> So I got this a while back.. but had not made a review. Idk y! I adore this blush plus if I&#x27;m correct I got it for a penny! It was safe and nicely packaged. It&#x27;s goes on so smooth I just love it!</li>
    <li> These are nice little pots of color - if you like wearing blush you may like some of the other shades offered like original rose. Hard to find in store. Enjoy</li>
    <li> If any one wants a good blush, I recommend you to use maybeline&#x27;s gentle pink. It is not that hot pink or light to were you can see it. You just need a small amount and it looks wonderful! I recommend it to anyone that doesnt like hot red blush.</li>
    <li> I like this blush I decided to put the bronzed down n do some pink cheeks. I like the color it&#x27;s a sweet pink but not overbearing.i feel like u have to build  the color it is light but once u start to build it looks perfect and it goes on very smooth not choppy like my bronzed.great buy will buy again</li>
    <li> There is a pretty sparkle to it and good coverage and also stays on very well, but I found that I broke out from it a lot. I think it&#x27;s the Mica in it ( mineral that makes the sparkle)</li>
    <li> I love this blush!  It has the right amount of color and shimmer without being glittery.. I don&#x27;t like being glittery.  I am light-to-medium complected with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since it came out but it  is no longer available in the stores.  Glad I could still get it</li>
    <li> Love this blush! It&#x27;s a gorgeous shade of pink and you can go as light or as dark as you want to. It has a really pretty glow to it and looks nice on my skin, especially in photos. I&#x27;m fair skin, blonde hair, blue eyes and this shade works for me all year around!</li>
    <li> perfect!, last all say, doesn&#x27;t look old or smudged, easy to apply (with a brush).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wished I had choose a lighter tone for my face xD&lt;br /&gt;over all, beautiful!!.</li>
    <li> Im a very pale young lady and when i bought this i thought since it was gentle pink itd be a soft smooth color but i just recieved it today, it was pinker than i thought lol im not gonna lie i havnt got the chance to use it yet but not very happy bout the color. I cant say too much for the price because its not expensive but if you want its worth a try :)</li>
    <li> but love the price! i prefer the Maybelline crème blush if they still have it but this will do was cheap 2</li>
    <li> This is an amazing pink color.  Looks like you have a natural glow on your cheeks.  If pink is your color then you better buy this blush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with this. The color is very bright pink. I have extremely pale skin, so it really stands out, but if I just use a very small amount and blend it, I think it looks pretty nice. I am very dissapointed that it didn&#x27;t come with a brush, because I was under the impression that it would. But, now that I&#x27;m looking at the description again, I see that it does not say anything about a brush being included...so that was my own fault for getting my hopes up for nothing. Overall I like this product just keep in mind it&#x27;s a very bright pink.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kind of clear for me. But in general a very good product. I like it. I like the case and presentation as a powder. Thank you</li>
    <li> HAVE WORN THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS..LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I love this blush and its a pretty pink color. It&#x27;s not too light .</li>
    <li> THIS MY SHADE OF BLUSH THAT MATCHES MY SKIN TONE, THEY WANTED MUCH MORE IN RETAIL STORES AND COULDN&#x27;T FIND BUT ONE AVAILABLE, SO I HOPPED ON THIS BARGAIN BECAUSE THERE WAS A LIMITED SUPPLY WHEN I ORDERED.  GREAT BUY! By the way the purchase was for my daughter these are her words.  So glad I could edit this review!</li>
    <li> Again! Maybelline is the Best! Love it that it has a little bit of sparkle!! makes my face glow! and looks more fresh like.</li>
    <li> Gifts for sister loves recommend</li>
    <li> such a pretty color i loved this product and cant complain&lt;br /&gt;looks great and you will love it to &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I love the illuminator and figured I&#x27;d love the blush as well, but the pink in this blush is REALLY bright.  Way too bright for a fair skinned complexion. This blush would probably look fantastic on someone with Olive-toned or black skin.  I&#x27;m sure the product is great, but the color for me, was not.</li>
