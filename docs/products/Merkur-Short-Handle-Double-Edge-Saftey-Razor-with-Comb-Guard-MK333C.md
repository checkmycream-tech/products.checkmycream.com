      <li>My brother ordered this product from my account, he loved it.</li>
      <li>shave is good but not as close as my 1970&#x27;s Gillette butterfly razor.  </li>
      <li>The razor itself was ok, nothing great.</li>
      <li>Exceptional quality, very easy to change blades, I recommend to anyone who asks about DE shaving.</li>
      <li>Best value for money - easy to clean.  </li>
      <li>Very nice clean shave every time.</li>
      <li>Sure beats the multi-blade systems that I have used before.  </li>
      <li>Razor gives an &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34; shave, I had a made in Pakistan butterfly opening $10 razor that was much better.</li>
      <li>Like it even better than my Edwin Jagger.</li>
      <li>Good, clean comfortable shave every time.</li>
      <li>Good strong construction and easy to clean and switch blades and</li>
      <li>Well, since all the other reviews basically say how awesome this razor is I would agree with them.  </li>
      <li>Trims well and easily, and, of course,&lt;br /&gt;does not pull.</li>
      <li>This was my first purchase of a safety razor and after using it several months now I am very happy with it.  </li>
      <li>I really like the razor because I believe in using old fashioned equipment and technique for achieving the best shave (close, clean, no irritation).</li>
      <li>so I just use a cheap electric razor once a week</li>
      <li>It was exactly what I was looking for my first safety razor, the build quality is excellent and so far it has now converted into my primary razor.</li>
      <li>It really turns shaving into an art form and makes it enjoyable.</li>
      <li>Pretty easy to cut yourself.</li>
      <li>No need for me to go into massive detail like they did :) :)</li>
      <li>I found that buying the Merkur blades with this product worked for my super acne/sensitive prone skin.</li>
      <li>Junk rusted after first use!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Using the razor on my head is simply amazing compared to using a regular razor or my HeadBlade ATX.  </li>
      <li>Other than that, it feels good in the hand and works well.</li>
      <li>My old Gillette has 9 settings and my skin was free of stubble for a full day.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried Alta, Diamond, Sharp, Shark, and many others trying to find a cheap blade.  </li>
      <li>I took the plunge and bought this as my first razor of this type.  </li>
      <li>Such a better close shave than the the garbage you buy at walmart.</li>
      <li>If you are shaving your head I would HIGHLY recommend this baby as a starter razor!!</li>
      <li>It is my first safety razor.</li>
      <li>wish Gillette would wake up and see the market for their original product ---even if for a limited time---perhaps an anniversery special???</li>
      <li>Furthermore, I remember razors that would open like a clamshell making razor blade changes easy.</li>
      <li>The blades are very sharp and a gentle deft hand is required, but once one gets the hang of it</li>
      <li>Very high quality.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe I bought into all the commercials and advertising for the razors they have on contemporary markets.</li>
      <li>Merkur definitely did it right.</li>
      <li>a new guy to these razors</li>
      <li>Probably won&#x27;t ever have to buy a new one.</li>
      <li>I am hooked now and plan to eventually upgrade later down the road when I learn more about all this and get used to it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The handle is real short...almost too short at 3&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin, and need to shave often, this is the blade for you.</li>
      <li>I also have the long handle of the exact same product.  </li>
      <li>However, I have thick, coarse, curly beard hair and this razor does keep the blade&#x27;s edge to close inside the top for me to get a close shave at times.</li>
      <li>Picking blades will make a major difference in the quality of shaving experience.  </li>
      <li>I tried out the weight and have discovered that I much prefer the short handle to the long handle.  </li>
      <li>I had great expectations for this razor but was disappointed.</li>
      <li>Instead, I&#x27;m going to eventually purchase and try Merkur&#x27;s adjustable double edge safety razor to achieve a cleaner shave because this basic one barely cuts my beard with my type of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>to chicken to try, but finally used it last night, and love it!  </li>

<li> He wanted a single blade razor because double bladed razor tended&lt;br /&gt;to</li>
<li> I am a 5&#x27; 2\\&quot;, 106 pound female who is not unusually hairy.</li>
<li> Reminds me of the one i used a long time ago.</li>

<li> All I can say is wow, what have I been missing!</li>
<li> Blade remains sharp for a very long time.</li>
<li> , there&#x27;s no going back to modern multi-blade razors with expensive cartridge replacements.</li>
<li> You have to be careful with this razor since it&#x27;s not as forgiving as disposable razors.</li>

<li> Finally, razors in the past allowed one to change the angle of the blade.</li>
<li> I hardly got any facial hair</li>

<li> I thought there would be a little knob at the bottom to adjust the tension on the razor, but there is not.</li>
<li> With the Merkur I feel stubble a few hours after shaving.  </li>
<li> The ATX is decent but the blades are so bloody expensive.  </li>
<li> The shave is sometimes irritating</li>
<li> For what id spend in two months for the other crap.</li>

<li> I&#x27;d return it if Amazon didn&#x27;t make it so hard!!!</li>
<li> The blade supplied with the razor is junk, I didn&#x27;t think Germans could make anything that badly.</li>

    <li> Very nice.  Reminds me of the one i used a long time ago. Such a better close shave than the the garbage you buy at walmart. And the blades were a great deal.  I bought a hundred. For what id spend in two months for the other crap. Got blades for years.</li>
    <li> Well, since all the other reviews basically say how awesome this razor is I would agree with them.  No need for me to go into massive detail like they did :) :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a new guy to these razors I took the plunge and bought this as my first razor of this type.  I am hooked now and plan to eventually upgrade later down the road when I learn more about all this and get used to it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave my head with this razor and not my face.  I hardly got any facial hair so I just use a cheap electric razor once a week and that takes care of my pathetic stubbles :D :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the razor on my head is simply amazing compared to using a regular razor or my HeadBlade ATX.  The ATX is decent but the blades are so bloody expensive.  I just couldn&#x27;t justify the cost of the blades anymore.  it was around $15 for 4 blades and they didn&#x27;t even last that long.  So I had to switch to something else and I found these razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weight is perfect for me, the feel is amazing, and it glides across my head like butter.  If you are shaving your head I would HIGHLY recommend this baby as a starter razor!!</li>
    <li> This was my first purchase of a safety razor and after using it several months now I am very happy with it.  Good strong construction and easy to clean and switch blades and what not.  Merkur definitely did it right.</li>
    <li> I had great expectations for this razor but was disappointed. The shave is sometimes irritating and I seem to miss spots on my face. Furthermore, I remember razors that would open like a clamshell making razor blade changes easy. You have to take the Merkur apart to accomplish this. Finally, razors in the past allowed one to change the angle of the blade. No such provision with the Merkur - you get one blade angle and that is it.</li>
    <li> Like it even better than my Edwin Jagger. Good, clean comfortable shave every time.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold the standard sized blade.  I&#x27;d return it if Amazon didn&#x27;t make it so hard!!!</li>
    <li> Great handle.  Probably won&#x27;t ever have to buy a new one.</li>
    <li> My brother ordered this product from my account, he loved it. I will buy one soon as well.</li>
    <li> Very nice clean shave every time. You have to be careful with this razor since it&#x27;s not as forgiving as disposable razors.</li>
    <li> Junk rusted after first use!</li>
    <li> I really like the razor because I believe in using old fashioned equipment and technique for achieving the best shave (close, clean, no irritation). However, I have thick, coarse, curly beard hair and this razor does keep the blade&#x27;s edge to close inside the top for me to get a close shave at times. Instead, I&#x27;m going to eventually purchase and try Merkur&#x27;s adjustable double edge safety razor to achieve a cleaner shave because this basic one barely cuts my beard with my type of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short: If you have dense, thick, coarse, curly beard hair, look elsewhere, and/or instead try the adjustable double edge razor from Merkur.</li>
    <li> Its great. Although I should have gone with the longer handle. Thats my fault not the sellers.</li>
    <li> This is the razor I grew up with and the one that gives the closest shave.  The blades are very sharp and a gentle deft hand is required, but once one gets the hang of it, there&#x27;s no going back to modern multi-blade razors with expensive cartridge replacements.</li>
    <li> I am not a reviewing type person, but I switched from a multiple blade to this. All I can say is wow, what have I been missing! I can&#x27;t believe I bought into all the commercials and advertising for the razors they have on contemporary markets. If you have sensitive skin, and need to shave often, this is the blade for you. As long as you take your time you won&#x27;t cut yourself, I have seen an improvement in my skin and the shave is closer than any multi blade out there. It really turns shaving into an art form and makes it enjoyable. Plus its affordable and manly! I found that buying the Merkur blades with this product worked for my super acne/sensitive prone skin.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I was looking for my first safety razor, the build quality is excellent and so far it has now converted into my primary razor.</li>
    <li> It is my first safety razor. It works well, the build quality feels sturdy, and it looks good after a year of use.</li>
    <li> I also have the long handle of the exact same product.  I purchased this as a gift and he loves it.  I tried out the weight and have discovered that I much prefer the short handle to the long handle.  Great product for a beginner to safety razors. Picking blades will make a major difference in the quality of shaving experience.  I suggest either Merkur or Feather blades.  I&#x27;ve tried Alta, Diamond, Sharp, Shark, and many others trying to find a cheap blade.  They might be 1/3rd the price, but they last 1/5th the time and never have the quality shave that even a dull Feather offers.</li>
    <li> The razor itself was ok, nothing great. Worst part was the handle is way to short, my hand started cramping just trying to hold on to the thing during my shave.</li>
    <li> This is a well made, all metal (no plastic) product made in Germany.&lt;br /&gt;The shave is good but not as close as my 1970&#x27;s Gillette butterfly razor.  My old Gillette has 9 settings and my skin was free of stubble for a full day.  With the Merkur I feel stubble a few hours after shaving.  I am a 5&#x27; 2\\&quot;, 106 pound female who is not unusually hairy. I do receive less \\&quot;niks\\&quot; with the Merkur.&lt;br /&gt;I also prefer the butterfly opening of the Gillette which Merkur does not make--or I couldn&#x27;t find.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy the Merkur again since the Gillette razor is no longer made, but I would purchase the longer handle of Merkur.  A longer handle may allow me a closer angle to my skin and provide a closer shave--hopefully??&lt;br /&gt;I wish Gillette would wake up and see the market for their original product ---even if for a limited time---perhaps an anniversery special??? Please!!!!</li>
    <li> Very high quality.  Hefty and well made.</li>
    <li> Bought this razor for my husband.  He wanted a single blade razor because double bladed razor tended&lt;br /&gt;to pull facial hair--he has a short beard.  He loves this razor.  Trims well and easily, and, of course,&lt;br /&gt;does not pull.</li>
    <li> I thought there would be a little knob at the bottom to adjust the tension on the razor, but there is not. Other than that, it feels good in the hand and works well.</li>
    <li> Sure beats the multi-blade systems that I have used before.  Best value for money - easy to clean.  Blade remains sharp for a very long time.</li>
    <li> The handle is real short...almost too short at 3&amp;#34;. Just another inch longer and it would be perfect!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright. Pretty easy to cut yourself.</li>
    <li> Exceptional quality, very easy to change blades, I recommend to anyone who asks about DE shaving.</li>
    <li> Would give five stars if it was a bit longer, bought the short handle by accident. Great razor.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a while since I bought it....to chicken to try, but finally used it last night, and love it!  No nicks.  No blood.  Really smooth!!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent piece of equipment. Arrived on time, but buy blades at the same time. It only ships with one.</li>
    <li> The blade supplied with the razor is junk, I didn&#x27;t think Germans could make anything that badly. I changed it out for a Feather blade. Razor gives an &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34; shave, I had a made in Pakistan butterfly opening $10 razor that was much better. This Merkur just doesn&#x27;t give a close, even shave.</li>
