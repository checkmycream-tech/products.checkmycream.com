      <li>Works well, smells good, giant bottle at a good price.</li>
      <li>It was fine for more than a year, but then I started to notice some dandruff.  </li>

      <li>The scent is manly, but not too strong.</li>
      <li>This is very nice shampoo, especially for men.  </li>

      <li>It&#x27;s fun.</li>
      <li>I definitely don&#x27;t have an itchy scalp and it does make your hair feel clean, healthier and more resilient.</li>
      <li>This is the dandruff shampoo that is consider by most the standard for mild dandruff.  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle (1 bottle lasts me well over a month) and will surely buy more in the future.</li>
      <li>I have been using this shampoo exclusively for the last 9 months and love it.</li>

      <li>You cannot go wrong and has a smell more male friendly than most others.</li>
      <li>Aside from the usual Head &amp; Shoulders benefits this is a very affordable shampoo for anyone with thinning or fine hair.</li>
      <li>he has always had dandruff and always uses head and shoulders, but this one I bought because of the pump and let me tell you its so much easier to have a pump.. will definitely repurchase.</li>
      <li>so you have to watch how far you push</li>

<li> My husband&#x27;s hair became dry.</li>
<li> and i felt it was really dry</li>
<li> This shampoo is pretty expensive in my local stores</li>
<li> After just a few days of switching back to Head &amp; Shoulders, the dandruff went away.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell if this product is 5 stars or 1 star because I bought it out of paranoia. I&#x27;m not sure if I am actually thinning out because my hair is just thin in general. That being said, 4 stars because Head &amp; Shoulders itself does get rid of Dandruff. I haven&#x27;t seen a flake since using the product.</li>
    <li> I had switched to another shampoo a long time ago, because it was a little cheaper.  It was fine for more than a year, but then I started to notice some dandruff.  After just a few days of switching back to Head &amp; Shoulders, the dandruff went away.  This is a huge bottle though, I suggest using this to fill up a smaller bottle with a pump or something.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  It smells like a  man&#x27;s shampoo should, not all that flowery, vanilla and camomile shampoo your wife uses.  I don&#x27;t want to smell like a flower shop after I wash my hair...</li>
    <li> This is very nice shampoo, especially for men.  It has nice smell, anti-itchy and remove dandruff, make your hair more endurance and less empty spots on your hair.</li>
    <li> Best combination shampoo/conditioner I have ever used.  My wife makes me try all sorts of brands, but over the many years this is still my favorite.</li>
    <li> I have a dandruff problem that also involves itching. Sometimes when the itching flares up, I&#x27;ll use this shampoo, rub it in and let it sit for 5 minutes, then rinse out - itching is gone. The dandruff flaking also subsides substantially, and with a couple more uses over the next day or two, the dandruff is completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> this thing sucks if you want to get rid of dandruff use tea tree. it dried out my scalp and i felt it was really dry</li>
    <li> good quality! perfectly works!&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive and fulfilled satisfaction!&lt;br /&gt;Delivered on time with no damages!&lt;br /&gt;good to recommend!&lt;br /&gt;No worry!&lt;br /&gt;I plan to buy another one when I get chance to...</li>
    <li> This is the dandruff shampoo that is consider by most the standard for mild dandruff.  This works well and stops the itching.  It just works.  You cannot go wrong and has a smell more male friendly than most others.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use regular shampoo because of my dry scalp so I tried this brand and it worked so good I came to amazon to order this large size. This shampoo is pretty expensive in my local stores so I got a great deal on amazon and i&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive scalp or very dry than I highly recommend you try this out, it&#x27;s not for every1 but it worked great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering more soon</li>

    <li> I bought this for my husband through \\&quot;Subscribe and Save\\&quot; and I am so glad I did.  He really has noticed the difference in his hair using this shampoo with conditioner.  It&#x27;s a one step process.  A little goes a long way.  The convenience of the large pump bottle is also a plus.</li>
    <li> This is cheap smells nice, makes my hair soft, and gets rid of my dandruff. Works great and worth the price.</li>
    <li> Cannot remember when I started using it, but I can say it is the best. I&#x27;m 66 years old and periodically have tried other product and have never finished them. For at least the last twenty years I have now been exclusive to the product.</li>
    <li> Gives my hair some good volume and keeps the dandruff away!!! a win win in my book. Great for anyone who has naturally flat hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of some of the scents of the men&#x27;s head and shoulders line, but I found an exception in this product. The scent is manly, but not too strong. Works well on dandruff, too, of course.</li>
    <li> Good for my husband. And this one is very durable, it can be used for more than one year. I don&#x27;t need to buy any other hair shampoo anymore.</li>
    <li> Much better than buying from the grocery store. Heading shoulders works great and I feel good after every shower. It does a great job controlling flakes.</li>
    <li> you have to love this pump, easy access in the shower, the scent is great and the value of the bottle is excellent</li>
    <li> This bottle lasts forever. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it if you are wanting to transport it, but if you&#x27;re just going to leave it in your shower it&#x27;ll do the trick. I like pushing it down and having the shampoo come out. It&#x27;s fun.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Head &amp; Shoulders for years. It works perfectly with regular use. Having shampoo from a pump is also awesome as you use the same amount every time without wasting on accident.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my son, not realizing that it was for thinning hair, but he loves it. It makes his hair look and feel great and the scent is wonderful. We will continue to purchase this item.We also loved the price, thank you.</li>
    <li> Just used it when taking a bath, feels good, smells good too. the rice is also reasonable. will recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used Head &amp; Shoulders Hair Endurance 2 in 1 for about 2 years now, and there are some nice noticeable differences. I have seen that there is a decrease in my scalp itchiness and dandruff flakes. It also makes my hair thicker and somehow softer. The 33 fl oz size lasts a long time. I&#x27;d recommend this product to any man who wants a dandruff shampoo that smells good and does what it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist, who is also a specialist in hair products, Dr. Jerry Cooley, Carolina Dermatology, recommends this products to all of his patients experiencing hair loss.  In addition to this I take Propecia and a 50 mg Zinc tab twice a day (I happen to think zinc is an essential hair growth ingredient.)  Even as a dandruff shampoo however this product is excellent and this size will last a long time.  I recommend the Subscribe &amp; Save purchase method, which I use.  (every 3 months)</li>
    <li> This is a good enough product, especially for the price. It is especially beneficial when combined with a stronger selenium sulfide shampoo if you&#x27;re using this for dandruff. Use the selenium sulfide 2-3 times a week and then this twice daily. I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle (1 bottle lasts me well over a month) and will surely buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> Great product and great price! I can feel the difference after using it for the 1st time. By the way, it&#x27;s not for men only!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find this economy size with a pump. Having the pump makes all the difference. And the price is great.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo, but finally an equally good dispenser. My issue with Head &amp; Shoulders has always been how their tops opened...which was very hard...now with the pump, it couldn&#x27;t be easier!</li>
    <li> Just ok sums this up. It has some ingredients that are known to not be the best for your hair. This did reduce the itchy-ness of my scalp, but feel it is harsh on hair rather than helping you thinning hair out. There probably is a better product out there, I prefer the smell and feel of this product over selsun blue etc. thus I will use it every now and then for itchy scalp, not to make my hair look any better.</li>
    <li> Love the pump, much easier to use then uncapping a lid. This has lasted me a good year and still going, granted I don&#x27;t have much hair but it lasts.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo exclusively for the last 9 months and love it. It seems like the pump gives out a pretty generous dollup so you have to watch how far you push buy very handy to have. I definitely don&#x27;t have an itchy scalp and it does make your hair feel clean, healthier and more resilient.</li>
    <li> great price and quick delivery</li>
    <li> i do not know if my hair is more beautiful but i like the shampoo. smells good too! cheaper at costco though</li>
    <li> Aside from the usual Head &amp; Shoulders benefits this is a very affordable shampoo for anyone with thinning or fine hair. I use it alternatively with the Nexxuss VitaTress Biotin shampoo and love it. This is a zinc based shampoo so it is excellent on the skin, my dermatologist advised me to use it on irritated skin when needed. So for me this isn&#x27;t a 2-In-1 but a 3-In-1.</li>
    <li> My hair was falling too much and I was so worried. After a lot of study, I bought this shampoo. After few days using, I got the improvements. Now my hair is strong enough and not falling much. Nice shampoo for hair fall controlling, itching and dryness. I will continue to use this shampoo.</li>
    <li> This stuff clears up your scalp but does nothing for the texture of your hair. My husband&#x27;s hair became dry.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, he loves it, I love it on him, and I think it smells great. We are huge fans of H&amp;S and would recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> Works well, smells good, giant bottle at a good price. Got her on time with no damage. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I use this always, so I like it. It fights the dandruff, is refreshing and good. Trust this for sure.</li>
