<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These were great for a few months.  But, the screw that connects the two pieces of metal has come loose.  If you look at the picture of the product, there is a metal cover piece over where the screw should be that is impossible for me to remove with common tools.  Without the ability to tighten this screw, the scissors are rendered useless.  I did notice that the Tweezerman product doesn&#x27;t have this annoying little metal bane and, despite me not wanting to spend the 18 some odd dollars, seems to be the better deal in the long run.</li>
    <li> This brow trimmer is nice and sharp, unlike others I&#x27;ve tried.  I can get the job done with absolutely no &amp;#34;pull.&amp;#34;  Unwanted hairs are removed quickly and cleanly.  It&#x27;s possible a considerably more expensive trimmer would do better, but this does better for me than the more expensive ones I&#x27;ve tried to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend without qualification.</li>
    <li> I love this, it really has helped me keep my brows in line. I dont use the scissors much but they are great quality. I use them for other things other than my brows.</li>
    <li> The scissors work great. They are nice and sturdy with great angle support. The comb is a bit flimsy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as sharp or precise. Over priced for its&#x27; quality :(</li>
    <li> The sliding blade gap of the scissors is uneven and will not cut brow hairs except at a few spots sending the scissors to the trash bin.  The razor does work well with the slightly serrated or segmented blade.  Poor quality control with the scissors tuning for the factory.</li>
    <li> Love this. The scissors feel very high quality and it does the job perfectly. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this is the little razor on the opposite end of the brush, but that&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
    <li> Really great for my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> scissors are award to use</li>
    <li> Apart from having eyebrows professionally done, this is the next best thing. The scissors work remarkably well, and the little razor-type side of the brush is excellent at removing the fuzz in between brows. I liked this set so much, I bought one for my sister. (Now, if we could just encourage all those elderly men out there who have caterpillars or overgrown bushes for eyebrows to purchase this set; whoever told them that was a sexy style in old age??? You know who you are... Only Frida Kahlo can rock that look!).</li>
    <li> I received this product a few minutes ago and I cut my index finger so badly. The plastic covering which has the black bristles are so tightly placed that while pulling it my finger got cut. Please be careful.</li>
    <li> The scissor are very awkward to use have not really figured those out yet. If you are familiar with this style of angled scissor then this item would be great for you.</li>
    <li> I loved it!&lt;br /&gt;Very cheap, great condtion and fast shipping. It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> The scissors work great, I just wish they were a bit thinner. The brush isn&#x27;t that good it moves a lot. I haven&#x27;t used the razor.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice brow kit with razor, comb, brush, and scissors.  It works really well for me.  I would suggest making sure your face is freshly washed (before creams, etc.), and if the razor doesn&#x27;t seem to be cutting, don&#x27;t press harder, try shaving at different angles--you don&#x27;t necessarily have to shave against/with hair growth.  Be careful/gentle at first so you don&#x27;t cut yourself.  Good buy.</li>
    <li> product is perfect for maintaining brows</li>
    <li> Great value for the money. Nice sturdy scissors. Durable brow brush with comb on the other side.</li>
    <li> good scissors... does what it says. Good quality and inexpensive.  Best deal for something useful.  Hope you enjoy them. tata</li>
    <li> This is all you need to keep your eye brows looking good.  I usually just pluck and trim.  However, this thing has a razor that pulls the hairs out.  It is quick, painless and good for those strays and hairs between the brows.</li>
    <li> Arrived as ordered and product works great especially because I&#x27;m currently in Afghanistan and can&#x27;t make my weekly trips to the salon anymore.  Would definitely buy from this seller again!</li>
    <li> Excellent mini kit for eyebrows. You can Trim eyebrows, shape them, and pluck them yourself.</li>
    <li> The scissors are awkward to use, but overall I guess I can still manage to use them. I don&#x27;t like having to take off my glasses and put in my contacts just to get a good position of them though. Too much of a hassle if you ask me.</li>
    <li> I like these scissors; they&#x27;re sharp and they work very well. The brush isn&#x27;t the best, though.</li>
    <li> Works well...good price!  Does just what it&#x27;s supposed to, although it may&lt;br /&gt;take some practice to trim brow with non-dominant hand.</li>
    <li> I like this little kit. It makes it easy to trim up my eyebrows at least once per month. I&#x27;m a gay man and appearances are everything! I&#x27;ve always hated my busy eyebrows, so this kit comes in very handy and is MUCH cheaper than having to get groomed professionally!</li>
    <li> I was surprised when I received this item. It took a little bit longer than usual for Amazon Prime but it was worth the wait. The pack featured a two pair pack. So it was a buy one get one. The quality is what I expected. It gets the job done and I basically use it for maintenance in between my eyebrow salon service. Overall a good product for the price.</li>
    <li> The price is right and works great</li>
    <li> The razor tool was great however the scissors were too dull to cut thick brows. Worked half the time.</li>
    <li> Excellent items at a great price! Easy and comfortable to use. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Cheap but works great! the scissors are fairly sharp but it can get awkward to hold &amp; cut. I&#x27;ve used the &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; blade a couple of times and it hasn&#x27;t worn out yet.</li>
    <li> You get a brow scissors and a brow comb, brush, and razor in one. It is super convenient because it is an all-in-one sort of tool. I would have liked the scissors to have a case for it because it is super sharp (great quality). Overall, I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The quality is good and the comb/razor set is very useful and makes it easier to use and groom your brows.</li>
    <li> I use these as part of my eyebrow-shaping routine to clean them up a bit after a waxing or threading, rather than plucking or tweezing. These work great. The blade is nice and sharp and hasn&#x27;t gone dull yet!! I bought a similar product that went dull after using only once. The little scissors also come in handy for trimming my brows as well. Highly recommend this product if you are looking for something to shape and trim your brows with.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend buying this product. The quality of the scissors leaves much to be desired. There is a slight gap between the blades so they don&#x27;t cut eyebrow hairs, which is the sole purpose of this product, right? I don&#x27;t find the design to be user-friendly either. I didn&#x27;t try the brush/blade so I can&#x27;t comment on that.</li>
    <li> This is a great pair of tools for maintaining perfect arches. As a professional makeup artist, these are a part of my work kit as well as my personal makeup bag.</li>
    <li> great, does what it needs! i use it to cut eyebrows</li>
    <li> purchase these for great brows</li>
    <li> This tool was not for me. I am left-handed and could not hold the scissors to get rid of the stray hairs. I don&#x27;t tweeze my brows anymore and since this did not help me, I gave it away. I am going to try eyebrow threading and see how that works for me.</li>
    <li> I use this product more often that not. As a full grown sasquatch this is a requirement! Very sturdy and we&#x27;ll build, the scissors fit comfortably in my hand, doesn&#x27;t pinch or put uneven pressure on hands or fingers when going ham on an eye brows. Scissors are very sharp and have yet to dull on me after almost two months now. The other tool is nice to, also sturdy and strong. It serves it&#x27;s purpose to cut, lift and brush. It&#x27;s defiantly not a poopy store bought item. and I&#x27;m a dude so I use it on my beard to get that perfect line up and trim the beard a bit too. If or when this item no lover fulfills its dutys I will be back to buy another. A++</li>
    <li> This is an excellent eyebrow kit, and it was delivered on time.</li>
    <li> First off, great packaging. I loved this brow kit. It&#x27;s so easy to use, much better than what I expected. These scissors are high quality and I love the brush. It even comes with a little razor behind the brow brush, It&#x27;s so great. You don&#x27;t only trip your eyebrows but you can even shape them using the little razor. I recommend applying moisturizer before shaping your eyebrows because the razor can cup you and cause a razor red bump. Overall, this is a great kit!</li>
    <li> Good ole Sally Hansen products, you can never go wrong. This eyebrow kit works wonders and I love it. It&#x27;s a must have in my makeup collection.</li>
    <li> Great quality, durable scissors.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to kit for my eyebrows. I fill in my eyebrows, since I can&#x27;t the darn things to cooperate, and I use my eyebrow filler as a guide. Anything outside, I use the &amp;#34;shaver&amp;#34; part of this to simply shave off, and the rest, I can comb and cut. It&#x27;s a perfect little tool that fits right into my makeup bag. The scissors are also very precise. Shipped out on time, and for the price, you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> I love the scissors, but the brush fell apart pretty quick.</li>
    <li> Not much of a &#x27;kit.&#x27; The angled scissors are useful, but the comb / brush / trimmer tool is completely worthless.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I ever own a eyebrow tool like this or even trim my own eyebrows. I&#x27;m very happy I came upon this little tool here on Amazon. They are very easy to use and I love the 4 tools in one. It had brush for eyebrows, a razor for shaping, the little comb to use with the scissors. For my 1st time using them my eyebrows came out pretty good I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get better with practice. Tools well made.. scissors sharp and effective. Deffenitaly recommend. Only gave 4 stars because I think it&#x27;d be better if comb was longer.</li>
    <li> The brush is pretty neat, and it has a small shaver/blade on the  other end.  The scissors, though is a bit awkward to use.  I like it enough, though.</li>
    <li> really good for cutting the wiry small little hairs</li>
    <li> I thought the brush was too soft and the scissors were not sharp enough.  The scissor should cut the hair in one motion and these dont seem to do  that to me.</li>
    <li> I will never have messed up, bushy, or super thin eyebrows again! I&#x27;ve gotten my eyebrows threaded too thinly in the past and I was just over it and decided to let them grow out to their natural shape and groom them on my own. I did, and my eyebrow hairs were now too long, so I needed a great pair of eyebrow scissors. These are amazing, especially for the price! And the little blade and comb is so incredibly helpful. These two things accompanied with a pair of tweezers and you&#x27;ll have great eyebrows, to your liking! I greatly recommend this little kit.</li>
    <li> I have yet to use the razor, but the scissors work great! As long as you know what you&#x27;re doing, these scissors and a pair of tweezers are all you&#x27;ll ever need to style your eyebrows without going to a salon.</li>
    <li> I really like the angle of the scissors, and the brush&#x27;s  dual sides are useful and save space in my makeup bag.</li>
    <li> Your eyebrows can really change the look of your face. You don&#x27;t have to spend a lot to groom them. But doing so makes a big difference.</li>
    <li> I had to give this a perfect review.  I thought it would help get rid of some eyebrow issues easily but it did more than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using these tools I don&#x27;t have to pluck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sharp stuff is actually sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s not much to this kit but it does better than I thought it would do so I really like having it and it&#x27;s very easy for me to use.</li>
    <li> Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Fair for its price&lt;br /&gt;Like the scissors in particular&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to other people, good buy!</li>
    <li> I had to order two of these. The first one came and There was tape and stiky residue coating the whole outside of the scissors making it useless, the second pair hardly closed also making it useless! Amazon was quick to replace.. how ever both pairs had issues making them useless. I threw both in the trash. Not Amazons fault. Just poor scissors. Do Not Buy!</li>
    <li> Good quality for the price!!!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this product. The scissors are hard to use, absolutely cannot tell where I am clipping. The &#x27;razor&#x27; is a joke, it does not shave anything, there is no difference before and after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to return it, but it is a big hassle to repackage and send it back for a refund.</li>
    <li> It arrived waaaaaay before schedule and work great. The curve and sharpness is exactly what I was looking for</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I expected. Don&#x27;t rush the razor blade,  you need to finish it a bit and learn how powerful it can be.</li>
    <li> very using product for maintaining the look of freshly groomed eyebrows.  I can go longer between waxings and save money</li>
    <li> II bought this primarily for the angled scissors!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little difficult to trim your eyebrows with those regular straight scissors...but this angled one makes it so much easier.  You just have to be careful not to poke your eye out as the tips are really pointed and sharp!&lt;br /&gt;The eyebrow brush handle seems a little flimsy to me and will probably break after so many uses.</li>
    <li> I do use it but I was more excited about it before it arrived. I thought the scissors would mimic the ones they use at the brow salon and allow me to trim with more precision. It&#x27;s hard to explain; they are actually rather dull, but at the right angle do trim the brow. Stick is average as well. If you&#x27;re just looking for an inexpensive brow grooming kit this will do the trick. If you&#x27;re a brow connoisseur these amateur tools may or may not be worth adding to the collection.</li>
    <li> i love the brush and the blade. but the scissors is kind of difficult to use. i have to be extra careful not to shave my eyebrow</li>
    <li> Kinda wasted my money with this one.  Only thing worth keeping was the scissors the blade on the razor is not very sharp and the brush tip is not a very good one.  I would say for to the dollar store and buy the cheap eyebrow razors they seem to be a lot better then the one included.  The scissors are fairly good quality but are on the heavy side maybe a smaller slimmer one works better for me.  Not totally trashing the product I just think there are better items out there.</li>
    <li> Pair with a set of [[ASIN:B000EMUDUQ Tweezerman  Stainless Steel Slant Tweezer, Pink]] and you will have yourself a nice little brow kit. I keep these right on my vanity table at all times. I definitely did not expect these scissors to be high quality, but they are! Little plastic shaver + brush is disposable, obviously. Refills can be purchased in separate Sally Hansen packs: [[ASIN:B004KS0T7C Sally Hansen Beauty Tools - Get In Shape \\&quot;Brow Shapers\\&quot; - 80905]].  The brush is very good, but I personally prefer to use the disposable mascara applicators: [[ASIN:B005QDL1K4 Disposable Eyelash Mascara Brushes/Wands 50 pack]]. The blade is very sharp, as it should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would most certainly repurchase.</li>
    <li> i use to get my brows threaded every 2-3 weeks or so and i never go anymore. it&#x27;s so easy to clean up your brows and cut them with this thing.</li>
    <li> Everything in great quality besides the fact that the packaging was open..</li>
    <li> First, the brush that covers the blade is so loose that it falls off easily. It makes it more annoying because I wax in a Spa and having the brush fall on my clients face while I&#x27;m brushing/trimming my client&#x27;s eyebrows doesn&#x27;t come off as the most professional service.  Too, when properly sterilizing the tool, the razor rusted immediately. I never use the razor part for anything so it wasn&#x27;t that big of a deal, but I can&#x27;t keep this tool cleaning in barbicide with my other tools because of the rusting. Soon after using I threw the tool away all together and now stick with disposable mascara wands, which I find works great and is cost effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scissors... OYE! I find them difficult to use on myself and my clients.  The shears are too fat so it just makes it more difficult for precision when trimming eyebrows. They are as sharp as any mid grade level pair of scissors, but I&#x27;d prefer something slimmer with the same slant or sharp tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, I could have invested a few extra dollars for a better quality product. Sally, you have failed me once again.</li>
    <li> Very helpful tool for shaping eyebrows. The scissors are nice and sharp. Great product.</li>
    <li> I like this set. I still have to learn how to handle the scissors as when I tried it seemed to cut crooked, but it could be that I&#x27;m not used to small uneven scissors. But I like it and I think I can use this for the purpose it was designed.</li>
    <li> Works as is and fast shipping</li>
    <li> Scissors are easy to use and gets all the strays because of the angle. I havent tried the razor thingy it came with, not sure I really know how to work it.</li>
    <li> This pair of scissors is pretty much pointless, they cut nothing, not one single hair. The little razor &amp; brush function just ok. I bought it more for the scissors &amp; they are horrible.</li>
    <li> Love this set, especially the angled brow scizzors. Definately makes shaping eyebrows much better.</li>
    <li> Very helpfully and precise</li>
    <li> Great little kit! Everything you need and it fits right in your makeup bag with no problem.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit after reading dozens of amazing reviews. I somehow missed that the scissors are angled and that creates and enormous problem for me. I find them super hard to use. They are great quality, nice and sharp, and I like the shaping tool, so it&#x27;s not a total loss for me. I wish the scissors were straight, though.</li>
    <li> Ok. so I am a clumsy nut and not great at makeup application or that sort of thing. I would never buy these expecting I could &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; my own eyebrows although I am sure that is the point of them. I bought them to help with upkeep in between waxes. I think a skilled person or someone who is more self assured could create the whole look by themselves with these tools and perhaps after I practice and feel more confident..I will try to take on more of the overall grooming  myself. I do recommend them though!</li>
    <li> This tool kit is just perfect. The blazer is sharp but will not hurt the delicate eye brow, the scissors is made of very good quality stainless steel, it is very handy, i use it to trim my hair, trim my dog, absolutely love this product！</li>
    <li> Seemed a little cheap, but does the job. Great for starters!</li>
