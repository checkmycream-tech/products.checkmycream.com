      <li>just what i wanted love the tweezers and the stones</li>
      <li>I wanted more stones.</li>
      <li>I love to do my nails and ran out of rhinestones.</li>
      <li>:) I didn&#x27;t think I was going to need or use the tweezer, but I use it every time.</li>
      <li>Me and my girls love to decorate our nails with these.</li>
      <li>Love making my nails look cool, lLike the tool to help use the rhinestones.</li>
      <li>But it looks more full in the picture.</li>
      <li>I was searching for some cheap ones and LOOK...</li>
      <li>Very nice to keep the different colors separate.</li>
      <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
      <li>The jewels are very pretty.</li>
      <li>I just place on tacky top coat, let dry an add another top coat over them</li>
      <li>well made and easy to use (with a steady hand)</li>
      <li>It is worth the money.</li>
      <li>They are nice a lot of different colors</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s still worth it.</li>
      <li>Pretty quick shipping.</li>
      <li>Just a plain metal set of rhinestone tweezers and because I don&#x27;t often use rhinestones they are fine for my own use.</li>
      <li>Was delivered during the first couple days of the estimated delivery window.&lt;br</li>
      <li>They look pretty on nails too.</li>
      <li>I also love that it comes with 12 different colors.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I ordered.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I got.</li>
      <li>And like all the colors Thanks</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t know if its really 3000 pieces.</li>
      <li>The tweezers are also very helpful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have no idea whether there are 3,000 pieces in the boxes or not, nor do I really care.  </li>
      <li>The variety of color is very nice, and several of the shades are hard to find.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The rhinestones came in a nice hard plastic container.</li>
      <li>I may have to add a clear top coat to seal the stones though, as I am already missing a couple - but no fault in the product.</li>
      <li>Came just as described good box not messy at all tweezers not great</li>
      <li>No where near 3,000 pieces</li>
      <li>These stones are littler than I expected, but exactly what I wanted to embellish my nails after I get them done at the salon.  </li>

    <li> Love making my nails look cool, lLike the tool to help use the rhinestones. And like all the colors Thanks</li>
    <li> just what i wanted love the tweezers and the stones</li>
    <li> Shiny, uniform, very few misshapen gems.  The variety of color is very nice, and several of the shades are hard to find.  I especially love the cyan!  Been using the one pack I purchased for months now, and only 1/4 through it.  I will definitely be purchasing again, when I finally run out!</li>
    <li> Awesome product and wonderful customer service</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I ordered. Shipping came fairly quickly and the product is great. Overall, this was a great and affordable buy!</li>
    <li> well made and easy to use (with a steady hand) Me and my girls love to decorate our nails with these.</li>
    <li> I love to do my nails and ran out of rhinestones. These were a great buy, Haven&#x27;t got to use them yet. But will be within days.</li>
    <li> I have not actually used these on my nails as yet, but will soon. I give it the high rating because the colors of the stones are beautiful. I can&#x27;t wait to try them.</li>
    <li> Some gems were mixed with different colors. Not bad for the price. Although I have only used once.</li>
    <li> Great variety of colors and perfect size even if you have smaller nails! I&#x27;ll definitely buy again when I start running low!</li>
    <li> No where near 3,000 pieces but it&#x27;s still worth it. The jewels are very pretty. The container they come in is nice.</li>
    <li> Perfect for nail art and the tweezers are an added bonus to place stones where needed.  I just place on tacky top coat, let dry an add another top coat over them, they stay in place for weeks till I remove them, no glue needed!  Colors are bright and no repeats.</li>
    <li> A nice nail art assortment.  I got it for a gift, but &#x27;she&#x27; seems to like it a lotl.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> This totally didn&#x27;t come with 3000 pcs. I don&#x27;t even think it had over 150. There were like 10-15 in each section, and the colors were mixed up.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Love every color. Estimated delivery date was between june 6 and June 24 but I recieved mine on 28th May. Prompt shipping. The box is very cute &amp; handy. The colors dont mix with each other. They look pretty on nails too. I may have to add a clear top coat to seal the stones though, as I am already missing a couple - but no fault in the product. I don&#x27;t think there are 3000 pieces but for the price there are lot of gems and I can use it for a very long time. A very happy customer. Recommend the seller and product.</li>
    <li> Smaller quantity than described. The tweezers were not usable as the legs were not the same length. Had to file down one leg to use it.</li>
    <li> Came just as described good box not messy at all tweezers not great but over all would definitely buy again</li>
    <li> But it looks more full in the picture. So don&#x27;t be fooled by image. I didn&#x27;t count the gems so I don&#x27;t know if its really 3000 pieces. But I&#x27;m happy</li>
    <li> These stones are littler than I expected, but exactly what I wanted to embellish my nails after I get them done at the salon.  The tweezers work great for picking them up.  No problem with any of the stones moving to other boxes at all.  I have no idea whether there are 3,000 pieces in the boxes or not, nor do I really care.  It will be enough for me.</li>
    <li> They are nice a lot of different colors but they are pretty small so I need to buy larger next time...</li>
    <li> The tweezers keep you from dropping the gems in the wrong places! Nice and sparkly! I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I got this in the mail this morning. Pretty quick shipping. Was delivered during the first couple days of the estimated delivery window.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rhinestones came in a nice hard plastic container. Each opening has it&#x27;s own lid. Very nice to keep the different colors separate. The rhinestones are a very nice size for nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rhinestone tweezers are not fantastic but they are what I expected. Just a plain metal set of rhinestone tweezers and because I don&#x27;t often use rhinestones they are fine for my own use. However, for someone who plans on using them a lot I would recommend getting a better quality set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very happy with the order and I think its is fantastic for the price.</li>
    <li> awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome. everything is so so perfect.! I am obsessed with it. thanks :D</li>
    <li> I had to order another set cause I wanted more stones. I like the case it comes in.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I got. It didn&#x27;t seem like 3000, but I also didn&#x27;t bother to count that many. The tweezers are also very helpful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would DEFINTELY recommend this to every nail lover!</li>
    <li> It is worth the money. I was searching for some cheap ones and LOOK... i got them. :) I didn&#x27;t think I was going to need or use the tweezer, but I use it every time. I also love that it comes with 12 different colors. Now, I don&#x27;t have to just use the silver that I was only going to get. I was truly happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Lots of stones, lots of possibilities. A great, quality product for the price. The tweezers are very handy and help out a lot with placement.</li>
