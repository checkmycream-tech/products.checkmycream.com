      <li>I have used frankincense a lot, over many years.</li>

      <li>daughter&#x27;s MRI came back TUMOR FREE!!!!</li>
      <li>I have had great results with the Plant Therapy Frankincense Essential Oil.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need much to get a nice fragrant environment</li>
      <li>so I ordered this bottle at a great price on Amazon, expecting that all Frankincense smelled gross.</li>
      <li>Shipped fast, and the Frankincense Essential Oil is great!</li>
      <li>This larger bottle (30 ml)is affordable and since we go through so much this is the best buy ever!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been learning about Essential oils and there is a lot of info out on Frankincense and what it is good for.</li>
      <li>I ordered the NOW product version of this and it wasn&#x27;t nearly as strong even though I bought the 100 percent pure  version .</li>
      <li>If not that, I am still thankful for the amazing difference it made on the outside!!</li>
      <li>Frankincense helps with respiratory issues and my husband uses Frankincense daily to assist more comfortable breathing.</li>
      <li>What a difference it makes to have pure undiluted oil!</li>
      <li>I have been using essential oils for years and have finally found affordable and great quality oils with Plant Therapy.</li>
      <li>Some people may need to use a carrier oil if they have sensitive skin, but I was fine without it.</li>
      <li>I fully and 100% believe Plant Therapy&#x27;s Frankincense oil gave that final push to her Cancer free MRI!</li>
      <li>and I absolutely love this essential oil!</li>
      <li>I have bought more expensive brands, but am equally as satisfied with this, if not more b/c of the great price and customer service!</li>
      <li>My first experience with buying oils.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I have ordered it from Plant Therapy, though.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This pure oil is in the process of healing some areas of my skin which nothing else has helped and I&#x27;ve tried many different products.  </li>
      <li>This one has super strength and is worth the extra couple of bucks.</li>
      <li>It has been working really well for me</li>
      <li>Much nicer than steroid cream.</li>
      <li>The smell really grounds me.</li>
      <li>~ The dropper in this bottle lets it comes out fast</li>
      <li>I do wish it came in a bigger size at a better price, but I also know many other companies charge much more for smaller quantities of pure essential oils.</li>
      <li>These oil works every bit as good as Young Living and is about half the cost, while still being a high quality.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely pleased with it - performs exactly as the other Frankincense Oils I have used!</li>
      <li>Rarely are things a quick fix when they&#x27;ve been around a long time.</li>
      <li>This is why I decided to purchase this oil in particular.</li>
      <li>and I made the mixture a little too strong at first.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Fading away almost completely!!</li>
      <li>I have ordered this oil twice now and the second bottle seemed a bit less strong as the first.</li>
      <li>I also add frankincense oil to my homemade moisturizer and so far I have no compliants!</li>
      <li>We are presently applying to some nasty-looking spots on husband&#x27;s scalp, with promising results.</li>
      <li>I am really into using essential oils for every day conditions and just for their health promoting benefits.</li>
      <li>I have been using this oil on my daughter&#x27;s one year old scar from two separate brain tumor removals.</li>
      <li>and I do believe it will eventually heal it completely</li>
      <li>This a high quality brand of essential oil</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m new to essential oils and so saying that, I find this product works on my over worked arthritic knees.  </li>
      <li>We had been using the Young Living brand, but they were completely out of stock frankincense, as well as being much more expensive.</li>
      <li>I use about 6-10 drops in a 1ounce spray bottle, and use it as a sanitizer and it does not dry out your hands.  </li>
      <li>SOOOOO glad I did not buy the RIDICULOUSLY priced bottle from the other brand at the home party I attended!</li>

    <li> I  LOVE LOVE it!!  I use about 6-10 drops in a 1ounce spray bottle, and use it as a sanitizer and it does not dry out your hands.  I figure if the &#x27;wise men&#x27; brought it as a gift to the New Born KING!!!!, its good for me!!!!  I have several uses for it,....for cleaning, and it leaves a wonderful fragrance, I ALWAYS have a 1 oz spray bottle with me,....when your out at the movies and need to use the restroom, its always nice to have a spray,. it makes up so many bottles of spray....I LOVE it!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using essential oils for years and have finally found affordable and great quality oils with Plant Therapy. My husband had bi-lateral multi-lobe pneumonia 2 years ago due to H1N1 - we almost lost him. He is doing great now but with some residual lung, breathing issues. Frankincense helps with respiratory issues and my husband uses Frankincense daily to assist more comfortable breathing. It works wonders! My husband swears by it and is a believer in the therapeutic value of essential oils. This larger bottle (30 ml)is affordable and since we go through so much this is the best buy ever!! Thank you Plant Therapy and Amazon!</li>
    <li> Good Quality.  Great Price</li>
    <li> Plant Therapy Frankincense Oil is a wonderful essential oil (one of my favorites) and has some amazing health benefits that I am learning about as I use the oils and learn more about them. I have ordered this oil twice now and the second bottle seemed a bit less strong as the first. When I contacted Plant Therapy they were so helpful and offered to send me more to make up for it! They were very kind and accommodating and I will definitely continue to order their products. I have also tried some of their carrier oils, the Apricot Kernel Oil and the Coconut Oil and really enjoyed them.</li>
    <li> Cant beat the price. Very nice quality. We use it on excema and use a lot of it. Much nicer than steroid cream. We mix 50-50 with lavender oil and just enough water to have it come out the nozzle of a spray bottle. The steroid cream is cheaper but has some side efffects.</li>
    <li> This is the best Frankincense oil I have ever used. I ordered the NOW product version of this and it wasn&#x27;t nearly as strong even though I bought the 100 percent pure  version . This one has super strength and is worth the extra couple of bucks.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast, and the Frankincense Essential Oil is great! I have used frankincense a lot, over many years. This is the first time I have ordered it from Plant Therapy, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely pleased with it - performs exactly as the other Frankincense Oils I have used! We are presently applying to some nasty-looking spots on husband&#x27;s scalp, with promising results.</li>
    <li> My order arrived promptly and well packaged. I had never tried pure Frankincense Oil, but rather through another company, I had used one which had a carrier oil mixed with it where only a small percentage of actual Frankincense was in it. What a difference it makes to have pure undiluted oil! I have had great results with the Plant Therapy Frankincense Essential Oil. In fact, I first purchased a small bottle of it, not realizing it is also sold in a 1 oz size. Next time, I purchased the 1 oz size. The scent of this is nice; pleasing to me. This pure oil is in the process of healing some areas of my skin which nothing else has helped and I&#x27;ve tried many different products.  I have an area on my neck where a necklace caused serious skin issues that would never heal and this Frankincense oil slowly but surely is healing this area. I am so happy to have tried it and to see the good results from the product and I do believe it will eventually heal it completely, it&#x27;s just going to take a bit longer. Rarely are things a quick fix when they&#x27;ve been around a long time. Obviously, this is good Frankincense!!! I do wish it came in a bigger size at a better price, but I also know many other companies charge much more for smaller quantities of pure essential oils. I plan to continue using it.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1F9NMNQK2MDW7]]When I opened my order one bottle of the two I ordered was broke. It appeared to have been broken for a long time, as there was no liquid inside the sealed bubble wrap. There was no option to file a claim listed.</li>
    <li> I purchased frankincense for wart removal.  It has done a great job at removing the warts.  It took about 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> I recently smelled a VERY expensive \\&quot;name brand\\&quot; of Frankincense essential oil and could not stand the smell of it but I needed the benefits of this oil so I ordered this bottle at a great price on Amazon, expecting that all Frankincense smelled gross. I was wrong! This oil smells GOOD! SOOOOO glad I did not buy the RIDICULOUSLY priced bottle from the other brand at the home party I attended!</li>
    <li> I got this to help with cystic acne and healing it.  It has been working really well for me</li>
    <li> What a great price and works as well as the higher brands.</li>
    <li> The smell really grounds me. Next I to will try it on my knees.&lt;br /&gt;FYI ~ The dropper in this bottle lets it comes out fast I thought I would drip 1 drip on my throat but it was more like a river.&lt;br /&gt; ~ Peace ~&lt;br /&gt;Oregon Nana</li>
    <li> I used this product and had great success. I had a ganglion cyst that my doctor wanted to have removed by operating on my finger.&lt;br /&gt;Being a certified herbalist I wanted to go a less evasive route. After 2 months of applying daily and covering with a band aid the cyst diminished and then disappeared off of my finger.&lt;br /&gt;I do suggest that people see their doctor to get diagnosed to what the problem is and then seek advice of a homeopathic practitioner or herbalist.</li>
    <li> The oil arrived on time and packaged in bubble wrap. I have bought more expensive brands, but am equally as satisfied with this, if not more b/c of the great price and customer service!</li>
    <li> I use this oil mixed with water in a diffuser and I made the mixture a little too strong at first. You don&#x27;t need much to get a nice fragrant environment and I found that mixing this with the Lavender produced a very nice aroma</li>
    <li> Seems to be good stuff. My first experience with buying oils.</li>
    <li> I am super stoked to have snagged this awesome oil in a 1oz bottle at such a good price from Plant Therapy. It passed the paper blotter test immediately, this is a quality oil and it smells just wonderful. I admit I am an essential oil snob, I have been using oils and educating myself about them for 15 years. I love that I can purchase a quality oil such as this one without paying a fortune, you will not be disappointed in this oil. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works great on my Knee.  Even helped my husband who is always a big skeptic.  will definitely keep this in the house.</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil on my daughter&#x27;s one year old scar from two separate brain tumor removals. The scar is fading. Fading away almost completely!! We use this mixed with Lemon and a carrier oil and the scar looks unbelievable! She is currently on her last weeks of a year long Chemo treatment regiment. She is doing wonderfully and has been nothing but on the upswing for a while now. We did a lot of research on Frankincense and Cancer. We are hoping and praying for a bigger noticeable difference on her next MRI with the help of this! If not that, I am still thankful for the amazing difference it made on the outside!! We also use it on and for everything! There is something to be said about the fact that it was given to Baby Jesus. lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter&#x27;s MRI came back TUMOR FREE!!!! There was a pesky little spot that showed in her last few MRI&#x27;s. On June 11th, it was GONE! It also showed some of her scar tissue on her brain seemed to be dissolving as well. Her 5 1/2 inch scar is now faded down to a little less than 5 inches and is barely recognizable!!! Plant Therapy products are THE REAL DEAL!!!!! I fully and 100% believe Plant Therapy&#x27;s Frankincense oil gave that final push to her Cancer free MRI!</li>
    <li> This stuff works. We had been using the Young Living brand, but they were completely out of stock frankincense, as well as being much more expensive. We decided to try a less expensive brands that was actually in stock! We are SO glad we did. These oil works every bit as good as Young Living and is about half the cost, while still being a high quality. We are very pleased</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to essential oils and so saying that, I find this product works on my over worked arthritic knees.  I massage it on my knees and the pain slowly disappears. And stays away for some time.  I also inhaled it and the days stress melts away. I&#x27;ve been learning about Essential oils and there is a lot of info out on Frankincense and what it is good for. This product works for me.</li>
    <li> awesome deal for pure therapeutic grade frank!! i will definitely be shopping with this seller again. the oil smells and works great!!</li>
    <li> This a high quality brand of essential oil and I absolutely love this essential oil! The smell is earthy and almost floral like but not overwhelming. I am really into using essential oils for every day conditions and just for their health promoting benefits. This is why I decided to purchase this oil in particular. I have cysts from time to time and find them painful amd after.some research I found that Frankincense is helpful in healing cysts. I used it recently and it works well. Some people may need to use a carrier oil if they have sensitive skin, but I was fine without it. I also add frankincense oil to my homemade moisturizer and so far I have no compliants!</li>
    <li> This frankincense oil is half to a third of the cost of other brands.  It works for me; I use it externally for various skin problems.</li>
