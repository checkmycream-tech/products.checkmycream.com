<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fantastic product!!!!</li>
    <li> First of all, go to Aveda site and check the price! You can get more discount price without shipping fee! This product is really good! I recommend.</li>
    <li> this is a good, high quality product!  It is not heavy on my fine hair and is not full of chemicals.  It&#x27;s worth the buy</li>
    <li> Over the past year I have been growing my hair out. I continued to use coloring products. I use the daily repair every day and I have NO tangles and my hair always feels nice. Protects from over exposure to sun too! I have shoulder length hair and I use a tiny dot after towel drying my hair and then style as I desire. One tube has lasted me a year!</li>
    <li> i couldn&#x27;t tell a difference at first but after using for a week i can totally see my hair texture change. it&#x27;s silky and a lot less fly aways. i bought some for my mom and sister for their birthdays.</li>
    <li> My hair is bleached, frizzy and naturally curly. This product makes my hair smooth, shiny and the healthiest it has looked in a long time. This will seriously save your hair! Use it like a conditioner though. Using a small amount in my hair before drying did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Not a huge fan of the smell of this product (usually Aveda products smell a little less grandma-ish) but it works GREAT and does wonders for my hair.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever used on my hair and being able to put more on between shampoos is fantastic.  My hair is no longer dry and frizzy looking it lays down with the beautiful shine I have been missing the past 10 years.  If you color your hair or past 50 you will love this product</li>
    <li> This is one of the most fabulous hair products ever invented in the history of hair products. It repairs damage but unlike every other product that makes that promise, Aveda Damage Remedy does it without residue. Every other hair repair product I&#x27;ve ever tried leaves my hair feelings heavy and greasy after application. You&#x27;ll see the results, in healthy hair that won&#x27;t look like its saturated in product. I adore this product, however, I do feel compelled to mention that the current price of 30 is highway robbery. You can find it for much less at the experience centers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply to wet hair immediately after shower and before applying any other products, let your hair air dry and enjoy truly natural looking and feeling hair that is substantially strengthened by Aveda&#x27;s highly effective recipe of plant and flower essence.</li>
    <li> I love love love the entire damage remedy line so when this came out I had to buy it. It has worked wonders for my hair and has brought it back into shape. Thank you Aveda. I highly reccomend the damage remedy line from aveda to anyone who has dry/ damaged hair.</li>
    <li> Great product, Quick delivery. Happy customer. This is the only product I like to use on my hair to keep it healthy!</li>
    <li> Best hair repair ever, also helps with grizzly control in high humidity!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. It has made my hair healthier.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing !!!! I read reviews prior to buying because I am skeptical anyway but took a chance because I like Aveda products.  I was overwhelmingly surprised at how wonderful a product it is.  I have 47 yr old colored very fine hair......thought I had to get used to unhealthy looking OLD hair.....NO !  This product made my hair look amazing ! I just received this on Sunday - who knew they delivered then??!!! I love Amazon Prime !!!  Took a shower with my normal smooth infusion shampoo and conditioner and then applied Aveda damage control and blew dry my hair....I didn&#x27;t even flat iron....my hair feels as healthy as it did when I was a teenager! Yay, for this product !!!!! I am seriously BLOWN away !!!</li>
    <li> This is the Holy Grail of hair products (depends on the hair type too of course) I have treated hair (balayage) so the ends tend to be dry. I use it in combination with Aveda Smooth Infusion Shampoo, it is the perfect duo. I apply this product before hair drying and my hair looks smooth, silky, shiny in one word &amp;#34;fantastic&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I have previously purchased this from  a hairdressing salon, and It was quite good, but the one I received was extremely runny, as opposed to my other one which was thick. It smelt bad too. I do like Aveda products but will definitely be buying them from Aveda next time. I would not re order from this company.</li>
    <li> I use it as a leave-in conditioner.  It does not weigh down your hair, protects curls and helps control frizz.  I have given it to friends with all hair types and they have experienced the same results: shiny, healthy hair.</li>
    <li> I love aveda! I use this hair product everyday to avoid damaging my fine hair when blow drying. Great product!</li>
    <li> When my hair is feeling lifeless and limp, AVEDA Damage Remedy really helps pull it all together.  It adds a nice bit of shine and really makes a difference when my hair is not looking its best.  I put it in after washing, then let it air dry most of the time - though there&#x27;s no problem with blow drying, I just don&#x27;t usually do it.  My hair is much silkier and shinier afterwards.  Great company, great product.</li>
    <li> Best damage repair product on the market.  Light enough for daily use.  See immediate results and great for all hair types.</li>
    <li> Fantastic hair care product for dry, damaged hair. I was hesitant to buy it at first because of price but it&#x27;s worth every penny and you don&#x27;t need much at all. The smell is amazing as well. Great product!!</li>
    <li> If I could give this 0 or negative stars I would. This is watery and smells terrible. I don&#x27;t know if this is just an old bottle or defective but it&#x27;s terrible. And avers is normally a wonderful product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this. I guess I repurchased it because I was in need of some sort of leave in and I want to add protein to my hair without having to do egg white masks. I really haven&#x27;t seen much difference since I&#x27;ve been using this. I have fine,dry and damaged,highlighted hair that breaks off easily at the roots. However, if I put this product anywhere near my roots, my hair looks oily and gets weighed down. I probably would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> although this product is a little pricey, it&#x27;s worth it. my hair was in bad condition from over coloring, and this, along with another Aveda product called brilliant I believe, really brought my hair back from the brink.</li>
    <li> I have only heard good things about Aveda products.  That is why I purchases this, but I was disappointed in it. It really didn&#x27;t do what I expected and was no better then products I buy in the drug store. I would not recommend it and it was very pricey.</li>
    <li> I USE THIS AFTER SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER WHILE HAIR IS STILL WET.  IT GIVES MOISTURE AND COMBABILITY (NOT A WORD BUT YOU UNDERSTAND).  THE SMELL IS KIND OF STRONG, BUT THE PRODUCT IS GREAT.  GLAD TO GET IT ONLINE SO I DONT HAVE TO GO TO THE AVEDA SALON FOR IT.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Smells fabulous and leaves your hair healthy without a heavy residue.  I use it before blow drying every time.</li>
    <li> I bought this product along with the Aveda Brilliant Emollient finishing gloss.  I use them together in very small amounts after I get out of the shower and after towel drying my hair.  I put about a dime size amount of the Damage Remedy product in my hair and let it sit while my hair is air drying then I add a squirt or two of the brilliant emollient, rub it together in my hands and finger brush it from the middle to the bottom of my hair.  Ive been using these for about 2 weeks and notice a great change in my hair, it&#x27;s shiny and soft all day long.  No more dry , brittle ends.  You can&#x27;t expect it to work on the first or second day but repeated use will give outstanding results.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Shake well, use about a quarter size amount and it smooths my hair out for easier blow drying.  Seems to smooth out my ends too so it&#x27;s more manageable.</li>
    <li> The product is good. The hair becomes soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> Made my hair very dry.</li>
    <li> I have used this product because my hair was * really damage* It is great. I don&#x27;t know if it worked by it self or because I combined the Aveda shampoo and conditioner too. It really help my hair a lot.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I have found---and I have tried a lot of other products---that helps control my fly-away, frizzy-looking hair without making it look greasy. I can reapply during the day as needed---especially during hot and humid days. A little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I really like this. Does not make your hair oily, very light but effective.</li>
    <li> I really life this stuff. Recommended by my Aveda stylist.  Use on my ends mainly, wet or dry. Use on my extensions to keep the ends looking nice. Will continue to purchase.  Only need a small amount so lasts fairly long.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this was just me, or this particular tube, but this product just didn&#x27;t seem the same.  I felt the cream didn&#x27;t smell like the one I purchase from Aveda store. and it didn&#x27;t seem to work the same.  I didn&#x27;t notice much of a shine as before, or the softness that it normally leaves.  I&#x27;m still using it, just don&#x27;t know if I would order this product from the seller or online anymore.</li>
    <li> Make my hair feel so gooood! My hair stop falling out and I love it so much. I would recommend this anyone.</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband who was having breakage problems.  His hair is greatly improved.  This is his second tube and rails against expensive toiletries.</li>
    <li> WE just started using the Aveda line but we love it.  The products make your hair feel so nice.  We have started trying a lot from Aveda and are so glad that we have.</li>
    <li> I use this product (leave-in) every time I shampoo. I have my hair colored (bleach) and live in a VERY dry climate (desert), so I use this product to help keep my hair in good shape. Someone told me the other day that my hair looked &amp;#34;glowy.&amp;#34;  Love it!</li>
    <li> Finally something that does what it says. The only problem I have with Aveda products is they have quietly resumed animal testing.</li>
    <li> felt the good base and will recommend to others</li>
    <li> I have used it one time so can&#x27;t really say. Advice from beautician: Put on DRY hair so it can be fully absorbed into the shaft. If wet, the shaft is already saturated.  Small tube big price.</li>
    <li> Best product ever made; helps with repairing dry/damaged hair.</li>
    <li> My hair always looks better, less frizzy, when I use this Aveda produce before blow drying it. I use just a little of it--daily.</li>
    <li> I honestly don&#x27;t get the hype about Aveda Products.  This product wasn&#x27;t awful in the sense that it didn&#x27;t do any kind of damage to my hair, but it wasn&#x27;t all that fantastic either in the sense that I didn&#x27;t notice any noticeable difference in my hair texture.  I bought it because my hair was a little dried out from all the straightening and it may have helped a little in that arena, but what I ultimately think I am looking for is a leave in moisturizing treatment for my flyaways problem.  I was disappointed to learn that Aveda doesn&#x27;t have such a product.</li>
    <li> UPDATED Jan 3rd 2013.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following my original review, see below, I put up with the toxic scent and tried the product several times. I must say I was pleasantly surprised to see that it did calm my ends quite abit. However i have to use alot of the product to achieve this result as the usual quantity of serum I would usually use wouldn&#x27;t make a difference. I style my hair often so the ends do portray the damage inflicted upon them over the years, so far it seems to camouflage some of that damage. I&#x27;m keeping my eye out for potential long term nourishment/repair as I can&#x27;t comment on that with certainty just yet. Will update in acouple of months if actual long term repair is evident.&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed after applying the product, for the most part, the scent disappeared from my hair in a few hours. So I guess I will continue using this tube, however still not sure if its worth buying again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW: (1 star rating)&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product from a salon afew months ago. Actually the product was pushed on me by two of the pushy hair dressers there tryin to get their commission and I happen to give in that day and buy something I didn&#x27;t know or want. I really regret it!&lt;br /&gt;Firstly it&#x27;s quite expensive and for the price the scent on this treatment is nauseating. I used it once and I never used it again. It&#x27;s been sitting there 3 months and I keep having to buy alternative serums. I&#x27;m surprised at all the positive reviews cos the one time I used it I didn&#x27;t really see any of the positive effects. Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve used other serums that have been much superior to this one, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> First off my hair IS damaged. Chlorine, salt and sun on a daily basis. I&#x27;ve decided to grow my hair out (I&#x27;m biracial) and as well as taking supplements and having a smart diet, I decided to search for a product to help topically. Oh my god did I strike gold here. Not even a week, and I can feel, and  see the improvement. My hair is soft, shinny, manageable, and a whole lot less breakage! AND that was only after the first use. Believe me If you&#x27;re looking for good WORKING products, look to further as you will not be disappointed! Aveda products can be very expensive, but the quality is second to none! A nice tip though use the entire line of damage remedy or a combination of the damage remedy and the dry remedy products! You will never use another product ever!</li>
    <li> This works okay as a rinse out conditioner, but had an awful smell so I needed to stop using it. It smells like a barn.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife. She had difficulty finding the product locally. Delivery was as promised.</li>
    <li> I love the Aveda damage hair repair.  It is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;If anymore comes available please let me know so I can purchase it.</li>
    <li> My daughter went to Aveda. I love their products to the point of absurdity. I actually get a little panicky when I&#x27;m running low.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have the horrible hair...thin, frizzy, dry, doesn&#x27;t style. Most products don&#x27;t do anything for me at all but this product makes my hair look so much better...shinny and smooth. It really gives hair &amp;#34;life&amp;#34;  without weighing your hair down or being greasy. It&#x27;s amazing how little you need to use in order to see great results.</li>
    <li> I have longish, unruly curly hair.  Anyone with curly hair knows how dry it can get, and the longer it gets, the dryer and more brittle it becomes.  This daily repair is awesome.  I&#x27;ve seen my hair come back from the dead.  It looks so much more healthy, and feels amazing.  This is now a permanent fixture in my hair care routine.</li>
