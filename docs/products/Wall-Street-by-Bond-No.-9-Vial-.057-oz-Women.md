<li> NOT SURE</li>

<li> Candidly, I am incredibly disappointed with this purchase in that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long at all.</li>
<li> Usually lasts at least 10 hours for me.</li>
<li> It smells like metal mixed with wet dog and that doesn&#x27;t do the awful smell justice.</li>
<li> The smell of the product was not a great choice for me.</li>
<li> Game changer.</li>
<li> I could tell this wasn&#x27;t a fake because I understand there&#x27;s some risk out there when purchasing online.</li>
<li> and i was skeptical</li>
<li> How sad :(</li>
<li> Truly awful.</li>

    <li> I must say I bought this on a whim because i stumbled upon a 5 star review and i was skeptical but i figured i could return it. BUT NOT GONNA HAPPEN!

My new favorite cologne, and I own many. Worth the price, if you love to smell great.</li>

I get more compliments on this perfume than any other&#x27;s I have tried.  Love Love China town for Women and Bleeker Street for Men along with Wall Street.</li>

    <li> This is the real Bond No. 9 I bought from the store in New York, but much cheaper. I love the store because you get to try many different scents, but if you know which scent you would like to purhcase, Amazon gives you great deal!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the real deal and smells great.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This product is not original,it was a gift for my husband... cheap ends up expensive, and he was absolutely right. How sad :(</li>

    <li> Smells real good,everyone wants to know what I&#x27;m wearing,will purchase it again,great buy for the price,love it,wear this all the time</li>
    <li> I was looking for a cologne to buy for my own use for a long while, and I really liked the smell of Bond No. 9 Wall Street for Men.  I had a chance to talk to a person at a local department store about the product.  I was told that I wouldn&#x27;t need to use much and the scent would stay with me the whole day.  Candidly, I am incredibly disappointed with this purchase in that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long at all.</li>
    <li> Stripper recommended this cologne to me.  It&#x27;s price is not justified for the scent, at least not for a knuckle dragger like me</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent. Came very quickly.  Absolutely will purchase again.</li>
    <li> My roomate gave me a sample bottle of this and I had to have it. I believe it was my first &amp;#34;High end&amp;#34; cologne. Game changer. No more cheap stuff for me. Pretty much Bond 9 or Creed, or if it&#x27;s a Parfum from another company, I will check it out. I get compliments!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loved the cologne. Great gift!</li>
    <li> Love it! I get plenty of compliments on this one</li>
    <li> smells elegant and gorgeous. the smell doesn&#x27;t last long and so I go spray some more lol. wonderful. great package too.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of this fragrance and have worn it for about 3 years now. Finding it on Amazon was amazing due to the amount that I was able to save.</li>
    <li> I had the complete opposite reaction. I found this scent so offensive, I couldn&#x27;t wash it off quickly enough. It smells like metal mixed with wet dog and that doesn&#x27;t do the awful smell justice. Truly awful. If I could give it 0 stars, I would.</li>
    <li> Bond never had this scent.  It is complicated and sophisticated.  Not for every guy.  It is for you gents who are trying to make a statement that you are a step beyond the norm.</li>
    <li> Bought about 7 years ago and finally used it all up so I was glad I could find this on here since the prices have gone up a lot since then. It&#x27;s a unique scent that won&#x27;t work on everyone. Your best bet with a lot of Bond No 9 fragrances is to test them in a store and buy them online. Usually lasts at least 10 hours for me. I could tell this wasn&#x27;t a fake because I understand there&#x27;s some risk out there when purchasing online.</li>
    <li> Get your smell good on with Wall Street Bond No. 9!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The smell of the product was not a great choice for me. When it dies down on the skin, it really does smell like a wet dog.</li>
    <li> Great for all day all night, and twice on Saturday best best best best best best the very best scent</li>
    <li> My son loves it!!!! We&#x27;re all team Bond now!!! I&#x27;m looking forward to purchasing more bond no 9 from here!!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful fragrance, love it!!!!!  People are always asking what fragrance am I wearing.  After washing your clothes, the scent still remains.</li>
    <li> NOT SURE - YOU&#x27;LL BE BETTER PAYING A LITTLE MORE FOR IT THE STORE</li>
    <li> A steal for the price.. this was 100% authentic and I&#x27;d smelled it before.. it&#x27;s basically a Creed ripoff (as are ALL of Bond no 9&#x27;s colognes), but it is still great.</li>
