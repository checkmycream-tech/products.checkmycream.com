      <li>The colors are beautiful, and the pigmentation is really strong: with just a little bit of the shadow you can make a really nice make up!</li>
      <li>Beautiful palette with such pigmentation.</li>
      <li>Very pretty palate!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not like a cheap palette...</li>
      <li>a makeup artist n use all kinds of eyeshadows even cheap ones at time</li>
      <li>I order this as a christmas present for my sister and she loved it.</li>
      <li>so many vibrant colors</li>

      <li>These are highly pigmented eye-shadows/blushes in every color of the rainbow.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a medium tone black woman and these blushes fit my tone very well without it looking &amp;</li>
      <li>but let me assure anyone professional or non..</li>
      <li>The colors are super pimentados and long lasting.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little better than what I expected but not quite want I want.</li>
      <li>The shadow pans are small enough that this probably won&#x27;t be your everyday go-to, but it is great to have on hand for when you need to create a specific look for a party or event.</li>
      <li>Only issue one of my shakedowns came put of the pot, but it was nothing a little super glue can fix.</li>
      <li>Comes in a thin sleek case that is easy to store anywhere, or accompany you on your travels.  </li>

    <li> These are highly pigmented eye-shadows/blushes in every color of the rainbow. The shadow pans are small enough that this probably won&#x27;t be your everyday go-to, but it is great to have on hand for when you need to create a specific look for a party or event. I recently used this palette to create a &#x27;Red Queen&#x27; look for \\&quot;Alice in Wonderland.\\&quot; With this collection, you&#x27;ll be prepared to create any themed look.</li>
