      <li>Product works amazingly well</li>

      <li>I used everything exactly how it was supposed to be used, over a 3 day weekend.</li>
      <li>I started using the oil first</li>
      <li>The whole process was tedious, the application for minutes after minutes for how many days and then not being able to wash for how many days, I did see peeling, but I did not see changes in the darkening.</li>
      <li>A darker intimate area</li>
      <li>It really works...worth every cent.</li>

      <li>sensitive skin</li>
      <li>, I just wanna bring back my old skin, it was not really dark .</li>
      <li>but I couldn&#x27;t bare the peel on my thighs</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used the peel so far as I&#x27;m waiting for the skin to heal before using the soap and cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was still dark almost as the same color really</li>
      <li>I mainly got this for my dark underarms.  </li>

<li> I mainly got this for my dark underarms.  </li>
<li> I feel extremely self conscious during &amp;#34;intimate&amp;#34; times now and I feel uglier down there than ever before.</li>
<li> If you have dry &amp;/or</li>
<li> The other 2 -Too harsh for sensitive skin.</li>
<li> I stayed indoors all weekend to be out of the sun, and wore loose clothing (flowy shorts or dresses) with no underwear as to prevent chafing.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way, and using a fan brush is 100% necessary</li>
<li> I did exactly in the direction after 3 days applying the liquid the 4th day it peeled as crazy, my butt and inner thighs turned red</li>
<li> Its OK but the peeling process is painful.</li>
<li> , I still have a few oil left</li>
<li> Yes the peel worked, and revealed new tender skin, but not long after did the affected area turn at LEAST 2-3 shades DARKER!!</li>
<li> A definite waste of 50 dollars!</li>
<li> Made a slight difference in skin color but not much.</li>
<li> It was a big disappointment, my area where I put the oil now is so MUCH darker.</li>
<li> First of all I had a reaction to bikini wax and left me dark spots on my bikini line,which made me very insecure.</li>
<li> You wore tight clothing&lt;</li>
<li> I saw a small improvement but not significant, this was to be expected as I am darker skinned and may need to do another application.</li>
<li> took a few days to get here but</li>
<li> It&#x27;s too harsh and it doesn&#x27;t whiten my underarm.</li>
<li> skin will lighten up after a few weeks.</li>
<li> I am using it now, but I don&#x27;t think I &#x27;ll buy it again, because it damaged my skin, my skin has peeled but still dark!!</li>
<li> The soap is unbelievable...</li>
<li> Now I have to spend more money to reverse the damage done by this awful product.</li>
<li> I was all excited to use this product but was really disappointed!</li>
<li> Negative thing is that it itches a lot</li>
<li> Too expensive for small bottles</li>
<li> and i started to peeled on the 3rd day like crazy!</li>
<li> I burned myself bad ly bad to the point where I could barely walk for days!</li>
<li> That is a very bad chemical that causes a long list of problems.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s so uncomfortable when I sitting and wearing underwear.</li>
<li> No happy at all!</li>
<li> Had to go online, even they were vague.</li>
<li> I got burned so bad that is worse that before.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s really wasted and worst product ever .</li>
<li> it got in an unpleasant area and hurt really bad</li>
<li> Burned so bad, I threw everything in the trash.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know if I will as the itching is terrible, I also started to peel in uncomfortable places where I did even apply the serum.</li>
<li> This stuff itches like crazy!</li>
<li> You will regret it sorely :(</li>
<li> Its very disgusting, I can&#x27;t even look at myself when changing.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> The soap is unbelievable...with 2 washes I started seeing the changes...Great product. took a few days to get here but Its ok.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how upset I am about this product. I used everything exactly how it was supposed to be used, over a 3 day weekend. I stayed indoors all weekend to be out of the sun, and wore loose clothing (flowy shorts or dresses) with no underwear as to prevent chafing. I did no exercise or anything different than the instructions and what do I get? A darker intimate area and I&#x27;m out $50!! Yes the peel worked, and revealed new tender skin, but not long after did the affected area turn at LEAST 2-3 shades DARKER!! So now I have unsightly brown STAINS on my inner thighs and anal area. I feel extremely self conscious during &amp;#34;intimate&amp;#34; times now and I feel uglier down there than ever before. Now I have to spend more money to reverse the damage done by this awful product. If you don&#x27;t believe me, I&#x27;m going to post pictures soon of what this stuff did to my thighs! DO NOT BUY THIS please! You will regret it sorely :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the peel so far as I&#x27;m waiting for the skin to heal before using the soap and cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)be diligent and apply correctly&lt;br /&gt;2)for the love of god, DO NOT create friction while peeling. You will regret it. Imagine chafing times 1000.&lt;br /&gt;3) it itches like the dickens&lt;br /&gt;4)be patient&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve included a preliminary peel picture. DO NOT force the peel. If you pull skin with the tweezers and it comes off fine, then ok, but if you feel a slight tingle or sting then it is NOT ready!</li>
    <li> It really works...worth every cent. I wish I took before and after pics</li>
    <li> This stuff itches like crazy! Make sure to follow the directions very closely. I saw a small improvement but not significant, this was to be expected as I am darker skinned and may need to do another application. I don&#x27;t know if I will as the itching is terrible, I also started to peel in uncomfortable places where I did even apply the serum. This stuff is VERY strong! A little goes a long way, and using a fan brush is 100% necessary</li>
    <li> A nightmare! Don&#x27;t buy. I didnt go to work for 3 days because it literally burned my skin after following exact instructions. The skin got darker after it healed. It was the most embarassing experience. Doesnt deserve a 1 star at all.</li>
    <li> The soap is amazing….It just changed my entire life and it&#x27;s great to prevent ingrown around the bikini area. The other 2 -Too harsh for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> It damaged my skin. I did exactly in the direction after 3 days applying the liquid the 4th day it peeled as crazy, my butt and inner thighs turned red , itchy some area is lumpy it looks like acne. I had to see my doctor yesterday. It&#x27;s so uncomfortable when I sitting and wearing underwear. Today is the 9th day and it turned BLACKER than before. I regret about using this product, I just wanna bring back my old skin, it was not really dark . Thank Marie France for making my skin damaged and darker. It&#x27;s really wasted and worst product ever .</li>
    <li> Worked for me! I started using the oil first and i started to peeled on the 3rd day like crazy! Negative thing is that it itches a lot but it works very well! I&#x27;m going to buy more soon.</li>
    <li> I gave two stars because. Yes peel the skin but you never going to know that your skin is sensitive  if you don&#x27;t do the  whole process. I got burned so bad that is worse that before. But started burning after the skin was almost completely peel. I am not going to do it again. If you decided to try have on hand the cortisone cream because the peeling process cause that area to be really sensitive and burned</li>
    <li> I like the peeling oil.  It really does peel your skin.  I mainly got this for my dark underarms.  The soap is good too.  I use it for my face, neck, &amp; underarms. If you have dry &amp;/or sensitive skin, I do not recommend.  My facial skin is on the oily side so the soap has done a good job at reducing the oil.  As for the lotion,  I haven&#x27;t tried it &amp; will not either.  It has parabens in it.  That is a very bad chemical that causes a long list of problems.  One being an endocrine disrupter.  Dont believe it?  Google it.</li>
    <li> No instructions. Had to go online, even they were vague. Burned so bad, I threw everything in the trash.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too harsh and it doesn&#x27;t whiten my underarm. In fact it is still red and too itchy.</li>
    <li> Maybe work!  I am using it now, but I don&#x27;t think I &#x27;ll buy it again, because it damaged my skin, my skin has peeled but still dark!! This is the first week, and I&#x27;ll use the cream and soup!  I hope those are working and better than the lequed!!</li>
    <li> Its OK but the peeling process is painful.</li>
    <li> It actually made my skin darker than it was.</li>
    <li> I was all excited to use this product but was really disappointed! I dont have sensitive skin....the product burned my skin making the area look DARKER! And the area irritated my u nderarms not allowing me to wash nor touch nor lift my arms for a week! No happy at all!</li>
    <li> Ouch! Made a slight difference in skin color but not much.</li>
    <li> AMAZING! Worked for me!</li>
    <li> Do not buy! I burned myself bad ly bad to the point where I could barely walk for days! I waited for the skin to peel and my skin is darker that it originallywas. A definite waste of 50 dollars! I wouldn&#x27;t even give this one star.</li>
    <li> Did all that was said it lightens a bit but it  caused me more harm! Burned my skin thereby dis coloring the section that dint have any problem before !! Will NOT buy again</li>
    <li> Too expensive for small bottles</li>
    <li> This worked but I couldn&#x27;t bare the peel on my thighs it got in an unpleasant area and hurt really bad, wish the application was bigger</li>
    <li> I advise using it is a wonderful product&lt;br /&gt;It is an effective and wonderful outcome&lt;br /&gt;Also deal with staff Excellent&lt;br /&gt;thank you .</li>
    <li> The whole process was tedious, the application for minutes after minutes for how many days and then not being able to wash for how many days, I did see peeling, but I did not see changes in the darkening. It was still dark almost as the same color really, I still have a few oil left but I won&#x27;t be using again. Used the soap and cream as well, and both no changes. These were done religiously. I&#x27;m Asian and Morena colored. Still though did not work for me</li>
    <li> DARKENED SKIN! I had to go to the dermatologist because during the peeling, my skin turned red, irritated and was very itchy. After that nightmares of a reaction was over, my skin started to heal, but MY SKIN TURNED 5 SHADES DARKER and still is. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. YOU WILL REGRET IT.</li>
    <li> I thought it helped with my Hyperpigmentation!</li>
    <li> If your skin turned darker after using the oil, they&#x27;re a couple of things that could&#x27;ve cause that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. You wore tight clothing&lt;br /&gt;2. You used the oil and soap at the same time&lt;br /&gt;3. You walked a lot or excersized when you shouldn&#x27;t have while on the 3 day treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your skin will lighten up after a few weeks. Product works amazingly well IF YOU FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS CORRECTLY.</li>
    <li> I bought the set. I started using the oil as instructed on the website. First of all I had a reaction to bikini wax and left me dark spots on my bikini line,which made me very insecure. When I found this poduct I was very excited. It was a big disappointment, my area where I put the oil now is so MUCH darker. Its very disgusting, I can&#x27;t even look at myself when changing. I regret buying this product.</li>
