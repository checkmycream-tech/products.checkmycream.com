<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> For the price, this is very good eye cream. I use it liberally in the evening and only dabs in the morning. I also use it as a night cream. It&#x27;s a bit shiny and tacky, so you don&#x27;t want to use this during the day. I make sure to pat the moisturizer all over my face and neck. So far, I feel like my eyes have definitely gotten brighter, even when I only sleep 4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is light and flowery. My sense of smell is blocked due to my allergies, so I had it boyfriend-tested. My boyfriend is sensitive to smells but he really liked it and said it was light.</li>
    <li> This is so light, yet perfectly moisturizing.  I have sensitive skin and this makes it feel so comfortable.  Delighted to find this company!</li>
    <li> I am in my 60s now and, although do not have sun-damaged skin, I felt it was past due to give the area around my eyes a little more care. I am well-pleased with the LilyAna eye cream. I had found it highly-recommended by other users and appreciate the selection of ingredients. It is gentle and without scent and feels soothing going on. Come morning the eye area is soft and feels like the skin has been nicely hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;It is a pleasure to support small businesses too!</li>
    <li> I have used this for a few weeks. Yes skin feels softer, but I have not noticed any of my fine lines getting smaller and it does nothing for the top of your eyes. It does smell pleasant and you can use it on other areas of your face and neck. I will use it for a few more weeks to see if there is a difference on the wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Very light and gentle. Didn&#x27;t notice any improvement with wrinkles but for that price good natural moisturizer.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Just started using this eye cream so can&#x27;t comment on results;&lt;br /&gt;however, it is the lightest, creamiest I have used. This cream will last a long&lt;br /&gt;time.  &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Great cream for those sensitive to chemicals. I&#x27;m prone to eczema and this cream has not promoted an out break.</li>
    <li> I really love this eye cream. It is extremely moisturizing, feels good on my sometimes tired eyes, and does not sting or irritate my eyes. There is plenty in the jar, and will go a long way since only a dab will do ya! Thank you for this great product. I look forward to ordering again!</li>
    <li> Wonderful! It is nice to know it doesn&#x27;t have scary chemicals in it either</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this eye cream reading all the positive comments it had. Once it arrived I did have to place in the refrigerator since it was too runny. It did thicken but once it is out for a day sitting on the counter it returns back to its runny liquidy state :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 6-13-15: changing from two to four stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received an email from LilyAna saying they truly wanted 100% satisfaction so they gave me a refund and later I received a package with another eye cream and a hand written note (can you believe that??! who does that anymore?!), such a personal touch, saying how sorry she was the first cream didn&#x27;t work out and was sending me a brand new fresh one that would hopefully be more to my liking. And it was! This time I left it in the refrigerator for a week and it has been sitting on my counter now for more than two weeks and has kept its think consistency!! Thank you so much for your excellent customer service!!</li>
    <li> Quality product.  I really notice the difference in diminishing fine lines.  There&#x27;s a nice &amp;#34;softness&amp;#34; and natural feel to this moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed.  Works very well.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Smells nice, feels nice. No magic happening- but no problems either.</li>
    <li> The eye cream is very nice, but the first one I received was really runny, more like a lotion. I used it anyway, but when the company contacted me to ask me if I liked it, I told them about the consistency. They then sent me another one, for free, that had not &amp;#34;melted&amp;#34;.  Great customer service, and great product. Doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes.</li>
    <li> Great eye cream! Very moisturizing, smooth and easy to apply, quality natural ingredients.  I only gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s slightly greasy.  It feels like it doesn&#x27;t quite absorbed all the way into my skin.  overall I like it a lot and will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Great products. I will be your repeater.  &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> REALLY moisturizing and great price.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is very soothing, non greasy and on irritating.</li>
    <li> Before LilyAna, i would buy expensive Origins and Clinique products. Lilyana moisturizes my skin without breaking me out. The price is better too.</li>
    <li> Nice and light cream, keeps my eye area hydrated. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product.  It&#x27;s a perfect consistency that Goldilocks would love . . . not too thick, not too thin.  Feels wonderful to wear &amp; does the trick with those nasty crows feet!  Love it!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice eye cream.  I use it at night.  I have very sensitive skin and this cream doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin around my eyes.  I will order this again.</li>
    <li> This cream (for me) is great for my face and neck at night. Ironically,  if I put it around my eyes, they become irritated.  It is too heavy for me for daytime.</li>
    <li> I have the Eye Cream and Face Cream there both wonderful products</li>
    <li> I love the way this eye cream helps keep my skin moisturized, especially during the cold weather months.  It&#x27;s rich and creamy and smells great...not heavy or perfumey.  I highly recommend this product, and the price is right!</li>
    <li> Lovely, light and creamy moisturizer! I am 57 and have sensitive skin. This cream absorbs quickly and hydrates wonderfully!</li>
    <li> During my quest to find a fantastic non-toxic eye cream, I am happy to report my search is over.  This cream is thick and feels really moisturizing and luxurious to the skin.  As a virgin eye cream user, I never much thought about eye creams and relegated any good moisturizer as sufficient for my delicate eye area.  Yet, I get it now!  This all natural cream really does help to minimize the newly acquired bags and shading under my eyes the following morning....and during my bouts of laziness when I don&#x27;t use it for a few days....I can tell!  Per its instructions, I&#x27;ll even spread this over my entire face if I&#x27;m too lazy to moisturize with my designated face cream.  As a rich cream, I agree with the instructions that you&#x27;d probably want to reserve this for nighttime use only since it is a bit shiny at first application.  If I could make one suggestion....I&#x27;d suggest putting this in a pump form since I&#x27;m not much of a fan of tubs.  It is really not a big deal but in an ideal world, it would be a nice touch.</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly! I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a few weeks now and really love it! I have a tough time finding facial creams that do not make my skin break out in acne or all too often, hives. I have found, that after a few weeks of use on my face and neck, my skin feels soft and no breakouts. I quite like the texture of the cream, as it isn&#x27;t too heavy or greasy and seems to absorb into my skin fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and plan on re-buying when I run out :)</li>
    <li> Some products leave my eyes puffy...not this one. I use this cream day and night.  This entire line is natural, yet smells good. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying your eye cream and face cream!  I will be reordering :-). I have such sensitive fair skin with a multitude of allergies plus Rosacea so have had a very hard time finding something that does not irritate my face but have finally found that product :-). Not to mention I try using only organic whole food items. I am very happy I found you!</li>
    <li> Bought this with the coupon and thought that I couldn&#x27;t go wrong for the price. I am sold! This is a great product and I will order it again. It is not greasy, has a mild fragrance, and does not irritate your eye if you get some in it. I even take off the little leftover mascara with it. They sell a face cream as well and I will give that a try.</li>
    <li> Perfect texture. Love it!</li>
    <li> I am really happy with the product. I had noticed my left eye had major puffiness and since I have been using the cream its gone! My face feels soft and I have definitely noticed a different with my eyes. Totally happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Love how in goes on and the feel. Not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> I got this as a special, and for what I paid it is OK. My skin is very sensitive and this did give me a bit of a reddish tone to my face. It does smell lovely though.</li>
    <li> Wonderful eye cream! I loove the smell and leaves me feeling refreshed! Awakens my under eyes with out leaving them greasy..</li>
    <li> Love this eye cream and the vintage bottle! I have very sensitive skin and it works great.</li>
    <li> Lily Ana Eye Cream is simple like going back to childhood. It&#x27;s a little escape from this hectic life. I love putting it on my eyes it&#x27;s so cool and comforting. I&#x27;ve only used it for a month and it has brightened and smoothed my eyes. Wish I could post a picture.</li>
    <li> I have only been using lily ana&#x27;s eye cream for about two weeks, I also use it on my upper lip because I have noticed softer and maybe a little plumper skin. I love the feel of the cream and l like that there is no fragrance in it. Very natural. I will continue to use this cream</li>
    <li> Was happy to find a vegan and cruelty-free eye cream. Seems like a lot of vegan eye products are gels. It works well.</li>
    <li> Love this eye cream along with their face cream. You can use both the eye cream as a facial moisturizer as well or vice versa. But works really great! Fine lines are slightly disappearing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now &amp; I love the results! My skin around my eyes looks so soft &amp;&lt;br /&gt;relaxed. Love the texture on my skin too. Great product!</li>
    <li> Arrived fast just as described</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Feels light and absorbs quickly, but is so conditioning and makes your skin feel great. I&#x27;ve got dry skin, so I&#x27;ve been using it on my whole face. Really nice product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful Eye Cream!!!  The skin around my eyes has improved immediately after the first use of this eye cream.  It has a faint, lovely smell and does not irritate my allergy prone eyes at all.  This 1 oz. jar should last a long time, as it only takes a little to cover both eyes.  I store the Eye and Face Cream in the fridge to give a nice cool sensation when applying it, plus it helps to preserve it&#x27;s freshness.  Superb product, excellent price!!!</li>
    <li> It is very nice and creamy. Don&#x27;t yet have an opinion on its efficacy.</li>
    <li> Great product will definitely be using this for a long time. I have so many people telling me how beautiful my skin looks and what are you doing.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> great product, nice and thick and has a great scent</li>
    <li> Leaves skin really soft and seems to even my skin tone I use it morning and night. Great product</li>
    <li> Not a thick cream or oily.  Feels smooth and absorbs well.  I really like the consistency of the cream.  Leaves my eyes looking youthfull and hydrated in the morning....Overall a great starter for someone young.</li>
    <li> Very good cream for the eye area. It keeps my skin moist and smooth. Would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product about 2 months ago but did not use it till about 3 weeks ago, I use it nightly on my whole face, which is really convenient so I do not need too many different products on my counter.  It does made your skin feel softer, I will definitely keep this cream coming.</li>
    <li> Leaves your skin smooth and shiny. Loved it. Though it says just an eye cream on the label, it also mentions we could use it as a face cream. I am using it in the night daily and feels nice.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and goes on so smooth and is so nourishing. The area around my eyes feel soft and hydrated.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried really high end stuff and this product is much better.  I also use it on occasion as a face creme. I will buy it again and again as it is truly wonderful and makes the area around my eyes very soft!</li>
    <li> This is a lightly scented eye cream free of parabans and full of natural ingredients. I absolutely love this eye cream. it is very hydrating, its got a slight slick feel to it, you only need a very small amount. I put a few dots under my eyes and tap it on w/my finger. My under eye area is totally hydrated after application and I have seen a huge difference in a short time using this. I received this at a discounted price for an honest review.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a little over a week and I can tell a difference already.  I like the feel, non greasy.  No added scent is a plus.  The skin around my eyes feel and look smoother.  I will continue using this cream and intend to look at other products that this company may have.</li>
    <li> I have only used this cream for a few weeks, so I can&#x27;t say that I am seeing any fine lines disappear yet, but I think it does make my skin look smoother. I like the consistency, very smooth and easy to apply. You just need very little, it absorbs easily and no greasy residue. Also, I have not seen any changes in the cream texture so far, such as the cream separating in the container or getting watery or anything like that. I think it is a good product.</li>
    <li> I have eczema and one of the areas that&#x27;s particularly bad is my eyelids.  This cream is great...  Goes on very smoothly, providies great moisture (without feeling greasy), and is totally gentle.  Most lotions contain perfumes or other ingredients that irritate my skin, and this one absolutely doesn&#x27;t.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> I have been waiting to write a review until I used the product for some time to make an informed review. The cream goes on silky smooth, is gentle on my skin and I seem to notice a reduction in the fine lines around my eyes. I would recommend this to others based on results, price, and quality.</li>
    <li> Make up doesn&#x27;t stay, and apearance aged  a decade. Sadly, does not do what reviews claim:(</li>
    <li> This eye cream is DIVINE!!! I&#x27;ve tried many expensive eye creams out there and never have been so happy. I use it as a neck and face cream  as well... My skin instantly turned firmer and smoother!! I get many compliments lately on my skin and how flawless it got. I love the fact that its natural and organic. Has no harsh chemicals and smells.... I&#x27;m just madly in love with it :)</li>
    <li> So far I love the eye cream, my eye area is super sensitive and this is very soothing and moisturizing without being greasy.  It also works well on the rest of my face which usually breaks out if you look at me too hard. I have had no such reaction with this cream.</li>
    <li> I received this at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really happy with this natural ingredient eye cream. Something just makes you feel better when you use products that are good for you and provided to you by nature! I love the Hibiscus. Definitely gives you a tight and lifted feeling. Feel good about your products and enjoy the results. This eye cream really delivered.</li>
    <li> Love this eye cream! It&#x27;s creamy, smooth, and hydrating. I love the ingredients and it lasts forever. I use it all over my under eyes and my dry eyelids. If you&#x27;re like me and your eyelids are too dry to handle eye shadow without moisturizer first, this should work for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also really prone to breakouts and this did not break me out.</li>
    <li> Nice texture to this cream, doesn&#x27;t sting the skin around your eyes.  I am new to using it, so don&#x27;t have anything to say about results as of yet. I would probably buy this cream again as long as the price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> Great product and will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Great eye cream! Wasn&#x27;t greasy or filmy. Loved it!</li>
    <li> feels great and seems to be helping, worth it.</li>
    <li> I use this all over my face at night and wish it came in a bigger jar! I do have very dry skin so it&#x27;s perfect for me. If you have oily skin it may be a little greasy to you. It&#x27;s a very light greasy though. I can&#x27;t say that I can SEE a difference in my under eye wrinkles, but my skin sure feels amazing and smooth. No breakouts either. Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Feels so good on the eyes! Can&#x27;t tell if it combats wrinkles, but I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Very nice cream. I use it all over my face when I go to bed. It seems to have made my skin smoother under my eyes and my makeup goes on really smoothly!</li>
    <li> Fragrance free and doesn&#x27;t irritate the sensitive skin around my eyes. A great product that I&#x27;ll certainly purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love this product, very light and natural, and feels great.  I have sensitive skin so I am always looking for good alternatives.  Nice packaging and excellent customer service as well.  Looking forward to trying other products from this line.</li>
    <li> Wonderful eye cream! Goes on smooth and leaves skin under eyes feeling refreshed!</li>
    <li> This is my second jar and I&#x27;m still loving it. I also use the face moisturizer. Great products.</li>
    <li> Nice quality cream absorbs nicely and has a pleasant smell.can&#x27;t wait to try the face cream.</li>
    <li> My eyelids we really dry for some reason out of no where. Nothing I was using would moisturize them... Not even my beloved argan oil.  After using this for about 3 weeks I definitely noticed a difference. My eyelids are now back to normal!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little container will last a long time.  Only a small amount is needed to go around my eyes so it&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of sensitivity to creams that I have tried to use around my eye, so I decided to purchase this as the ingredient listing was exactly what I was looking for. I have had no problems that I typically have had with other eye creams -- redness, irritation, and most eye creams even make my eyes red and water. This is a thick cream so a little goes a long way. It has a pleasant but light scent. This is a fairly thick cream, so a small amount goes a long way. Very pleased with the purchase and feel that it does a great job moisturizing!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s been a great difference with the way my eyes look after using this for a couple of weeks. I tried another eye cream recently and I immediately went back to LilyAna. It makes the skin around my eyes brighter and tighter.</li>
    <li> I started using this eye cream at night before I go to bed. It&#x27;s very hydrating. I would recommend and will repurchase.</li>
    <li> I love that it is oderless and light in texture. It absorbs well.</li>
    <li> Eye cream that is not heavy or sticky feeling. Pleasant light scent. It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> Very lovely seller she sent a really nice email thanking me for my purchase. I love the cream is feels so nice on my extra sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have Rosacea and this lovey cream has helped with the dry flaky patches that you get with this annoying condition.  I know it&#x27;s an eye cream, and I use it as such, but it&#x27;s the only thing that has helped with the dry patches and does not irritate my skin.  There is a lot to be said about natural skin care products and I&#x27;m glad to have found this company!</li>
    <li> great product! definitely made the areas around my eyes softer. also it&#x27;s a great deal, 1 oz is going to last a while!</li>
    <li> Moisturizes very well! Nice packaging too!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I have not been this impressed with a product in a long time. This cream is amazing. You only have to use a little and it goes a long way. I have already recommended it to friends. Also, the owner of the company herself contacted me and was super friendly. It&#x27;s a small company that has great products. I am going to look at their other stuff too! &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with purchase and seller.  A beautiful description of the the product and I would purchase from seller again.  Eye cream works very nice for me without being greasy.  I use it twice daily.  Softens lines and moisturizers the skin.  Dab a little on your lips at night for soft lips too.</li>
    <li> This product is the best I ever had, and believe me I tried many very expensive product prior purchasing this one. Most of them caused allergy reaction. I was frustrated to the point I used only coconut oil. But being close to 40 I knew I had to start using more advanced products. I have to admit i bought this cream by accident as I never heard about the company but I am very amazed and the company just got a new loyal client. i love it as it absorbed very quickly and does not cause any allergic reaction.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a week, but so far, I love it!  Am actually using it all over my face and my skin looks radiant!</li>
    <li> This eye cream feels great all over my neck and eyes! Love this stuff! I can see and feel a difference in my skin!</li>
    <li> I love it! My eyes are very sensitive to most eye cream products. Oftentimes I have an allergic reaction to eye creams and my eyelids are all red and puffy when I first wake up. This cream absorbs into my skin perfectly. It is not greasy and my 56 year old eyes are looking considerably younger when I get up in the morning. Definitely a winner to me.</li>
    <li> It is so silky and well applied on the skin. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I received the Lilyana eye cream moisturizer through a special provided by the company.  I keep the jar on my desk and use it throughout the day around my eyes. It is refreshing and makes the area around my eyes feel good, a great pick-me-up during the day.</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye cream for awhile now and my eyes in the morning do not have the black circles under them.  I will be using this again.</li>
    <li> Great eyecream. Not too heavy, but definitely rich and moisturizing. No obnoxious scent, either. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Nice and cool to the skin.Did not see much difference on my almost 60 year old skin but felt nice.</li>
    <li> Eye cream is the best-- just what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;New favorite!!</li>
    <li> Great eye cream. No fuss, no fragrance and no reaction on my overly sensitive skin. A little bit goes a long way. The cream absorbs into my oily skin without leaving a greasy feel or look like some other creams I have used.</li>
    <li> Great eye cream that works wonderfully on sensitive skin. I was wanting something that was free of harsh chemicals, yet still effective. I have found it - and at a great price to boot!</li>
    <li> Nice texture!  Love that it&#x27;s natural!</li>
    <li> I am really happy with the eye cream so far. I apply it at night to the skin under and around my eyes just as the directions say to. I have very sensitive skin and this does not bother it in the least. I also really like that it is natural ingredients and nothing chemically harsh. Nice light scent as well. I will definitely purchase again. Very happy with your product and business. They even emailed me personally for feedback. Don&#x27;t get that too often these days!</li>
    <li> I like the 94% natural aspect of this product, but I did not find it changed any appearance around my eyes. I&#x27;m also not a fan of a jar like this for eye cream (now I realize I prefer the pump dispenser).</li>
    <li> Love this eye cream, it goes on smooth and doesnt feel oily nor does it feel dry minutes after its applied, skin stays smooth and soft for a good while!</li>
    <li> Very happy with results.  I used too much at first and the cream &amp;#34;traveled&amp;#34; into my eye area and caused irritation.  So, now I use less.  Works best when I use every 3-4 days.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I have have very dark and often swollen under eye circles and I feel like my eyes look 10 times better after using this.  I use this after my nightly skin care routine as one of the lasts steps and sleep with it on.  I am only 20 so wrinkles aren&#x27;t an issue for me yet, but I can see how this would help.  It is very soft and moisturizing.  The consistency is thin, but not too thin.  The scent is very very light.  Overall definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I really love this eye cream. I actually used it all over my face as well and I loved the way it made my face glow.  It keeps the skin soft and healthy looking.  I was looking for a better moisturizer under my makeup and I really love the way this one worked.  I also didn&#x27;t have any allergic reactions around my eyes nor on my face, so it was perfect.  I can&#x27;t trust all eye creams because of the sensitivity to my eyes, but this one worked very well.</li>
    <li> Love this cream! Very smooth... not only am I using it for around my eyes, but also on my neck area. It also has a great scent, not overpowering!  Nice to know that it is free of parabens and has no artificial color or fragrance!  So glad that I found this!</li>
    <li> I love how great this eye cream is. Love how it leaves my eyes so soft and smooth. It&#x27;s working and I&#x27;m seeing great results. Love the natural products.</li>
    <li> This cream is very light and hydrating and feels good on my skin.  Its not greasy and is quickly absorbed.  I have very sensitive eyes that water all the time and this cream is so gentle it has not affected me!  I really love it so far but the long term results remain to be seen since I just received it and have only used it twice so far!  I am so impressed I am buying another one for my travel bag.  It feels just as nice as Obagi but at a fraction of the price!  What I really need to brag about is the customer service I received from Sheryl at LilyAna Naturals!  I had a problem with my original order (totally Amazon&#x27;s fault) and I emailed her just to let her know of the issue.  Sheryl wasted no time in making things better than right--and she didn&#x27;t need to!  With customer service like that, you can&#x27;t go wrong!  Would definitely recommend and plan to buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Goes on so nicely and a little goes a long way.  Price is great!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Great Product. Works just as described. You only need a small dab. Really moisturizes the eye area and diminishes fine lines. Great price and quick shipping. Love it ! Will order again.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t write a review right away because I wanted some time to use the product to form an impression.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never heard of this company before and it was a spur of the moment purchase. I have been using the cream for about a month and I am very impressed. It sinks into the skin and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy but it really makes my skin feel supple and soft, and has a fresh clean scent. I also like that this is a family business and they really care about their product. They sent and friendly email before the cream arrived with instructions on what to do if shipping caused the product to separate since it is a natural ingredient cream. I really liked that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all I would have to say I would purchase from this company again and I would purchase the product again as well.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;MY FAVORITE CREAM!!! GREAT PRODUCTS!!!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Love this eye cream. I will purchase again. Some of the ones I used in the past irritated my eyes but this one has no harmful ingredients. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing for a lightweight cream. Some days I use only as an eye cream but some days when I an in a hurry I use as a facial moisturizer as well. Absorbs quickly with no lingering scent. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Here you get the best eye cream out there for.... Wait for it....... A super hydrating product that will last you more than a week at a price that is within the pocketbook??!!!  Amazing but it also reduced the visibility of my crowsfeet... And was a great base for my under eye concealer.  Remember a little goes far... I am really pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have been using it for a few weeks and the skin around my eye looks amazing! I love how the ingredients are natural too.</li>
    <li> I really like this eye cream. I&#x27;m used to using gels so this is my first time in years using a cream again. I apply it at night time before bed as it takes a while to absorb into my skin. When I wake up my eyes feel very moisturized and are not nearly as puffy as usual. The one thing I will mention is DO NOT use more than a dab. That&#x27;s all you need.&lt;br /&gt;Since I live in Florida there is a little bit of seperation that occurs some days in the container (when the ac is off during the day) which isn&#x27;t an issue. Just get a tooth pick and stir it up!</li>
    <li> Very good moisturizer under make up. It is not greasy and absorb quickly.</li>
    <li> I really like this eye cream. I am sensitive to some products and this one is non irritating. I actually use it on my whole face sometimes. Good product!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the LilyAna eye moisturizer. The service was prompt, courteous and followed by an email from customer service with additional instruction for use and an email to contact if I had any questions. The moisturizer goes on smoothly, my skin feels so good and I love the fact that it has all natural ingredients. A terrific product at an unbelievable price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s unscented and it does the job but not amazing in any way. It&#x27;s a very generic cream, but for the price and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes I&#x27;ll finish it.</li>
    <li> I love this creamy eye cream. It has a light silky texture that needs little help absorbing into my undereye area. I have been using it for a month now and it is a good product. It is gentle and just feels nice when you dab it on. After purchasing they sent me a coupon for the face cream from this line! Wiil definitely try :)</li>
    <li> I really really like this cream!  It is not greasy and not heavy at all.  My cheeks get a little dry, even with using coconut oil.  I usually use coconut oil as a moisturizer for face and body.  I actually prefer this cream for my face.  My face still feels nicely moisturized even late the next evening and never greasy or nasty.  It has a faint aroma from the rosehips and hibiscus and I&#x27;m contemplating adding a little rose oil for fragrance. No big deal.  I got it at the $1 promo price however, I really would buy it at regular price.  Well worth it!  Great ingredients.</li>
    <li> So excited to try this out. I can&#x27;t use regular over the counter eye cream because it makes my eyes burn. I used this last night and no burning and it was light, non greasy. Loving it already.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream and the face cream. This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought both products. They definitely work to minimize the fine lines and a little goes a long way. I&#x27;m pushing 60 and notice the difference using it. Smooth and creamy, pleasant scent. This will be the only face and eye creams I&#x27;ll ever purchase.</li>
    <li> I have server allergies. I can use the cream on my entire face. Thank you.</li>
    <li> very soothing&lt;br /&gt;smells delicious&lt;br /&gt;will buy again</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve only used a short time, but so far, I&#x27;d recommend for moisturizing and smoothing your skin. &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> If allergy does not bother you, then this cream should be good. But I have extra sensitive eyes, after two mibutes had to run and wash my eyes :(</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye cream for about a week, and I love it! I had been going through mild panic because it seems as if the Bliss eye cream that I had been using for many years, has now been discontinued. I wanted a non-oily, hydrating cream, and it looks like I found it in this Rosehip &amp; Hibiscus eye cream and....at half the cost of my previous brand. Very happy indeed!!! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I really like how it feels. I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to say if there are awesome long term results. However, I love how natural it is. I have even caught my husband using it. He said he really likes how it feels on his eyes too. The company emailed me to ensure that I was liking the product which I thought was a nice touch.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It&#x27;s rich yet light.  I use it on my face and neck.  I notice lightening underneath my eyes.  Smell is very light.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite eye cream.  It is rich and creamy and leaves my eye area feeling hydrated and smooth.  I put the jar in the refrigerator so the cream is cold, and I&#x27;ve noticed the puffiness is also reduced.  I will be reordering this cream again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this about a month now and I like it a lot more compared to other eye creams I&#x27;ve used. This one does not irritate the skin around my eyes (I don&#x27;t really have sensitive skin) and is very moisturizing. I&#x27;m 26 and started using it because I noticed my undereye concealer began to be cakey because my skin around my eyes was so dry(I had been using my Aveeno Clear Complexion moisturizer around my eyes as well as the rest of my face). I think it does help a bit with dark circles, I don&#x27;t feel they&#x27;re so bad anymore. Overall the product is very natural with no perfume-y smell, does an excellent job at moisturizing, and is very economic (a little bit goes a long way, will last me a long while). Unless I hear of another product that is a miracle moisturizer, I will probably want to purchase this one again. ***UPDATE*** I forgot to use it one day when I was in a hurry, but it was still easy to put on my makeup! That&#x27;s a great sign!</li>
    <li> I am really liking this cream.  I like Rosehip oil and use it daily so I thought I would try this.&lt;br /&gt;Very moisturizing and no overwhelming scent. Other reviews have mentioned that is is &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; and it is not really thick and creamy like you&#x27;d expect a &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; to be, but it still seems to work well.  I did not notice any stinging that others have had.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic cream, which moisturizes and firms very well, and with excellent consistency. The seller is super friendly and pleasant too!</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed the eye cream so far. It is plenty rich and creamy to&lt;br /&gt;moisturize, without being heavy or greasy. It also doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes&lt;br /&gt;like some other creams. And I like that you only have to use a tiny bit--I&lt;br /&gt;expect the container will last me a long time.</li>
    <li> I bought this creame 6 weeks ago and wanted to give it adequate time to show effect before leaving a review.  To be honest, after 2x/daily use (morning and night) I am not seeing an effect on my fine wrinkles around my eyes at all.  I am 39, never really had any wrinkles until the last year.  They came on quite suddenly (the type you get from smiling a lot). So, all of a sudden, I want to find some GOOD eye cream.  This company does have very good customer service (a lot of contact post purchase to make sure you&#x27;re happy).  But the contact happens right after purchase, and I had not expected immediate effect, so I was not ready to review.  But 6 weeks of daily use, I should have noticed the cream working by now, and, sadly, it has not worked for me.  On to trying to searching more eye creams for something that might work.  Btw, I do like the cream&#x27;s texture (light, easy to smooth on) and there is quite a lot for your money, it will last probably 4-6 months, so if it does work for you, it&#x27;s a good deal.  It also is not irritating (i.e. some creams react with your face moisturizer and will burn).</li>
    <li> Cream works as advertised. You have to apply it every night and it works wonders. Store it in the refrigerator. Again I love it.</li>
    <li> Makes my eyes feel so good.  I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Resaonable price and big jar .i use all my face .very smooth but not oily so far so good</li>
    <li> I tried this because I received a coupon.  I love it!  It works as well as Olay or Lloreal night creams.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too greasy after you apply it, doesn&#x27;t really help me anything.</li>
    <li> Works good! Skin seems smoother!</li>
    <li> Thank you for postcard. I have been using eye cream  purchased via amazon at night. In response to your post card I do like the cream at night;however, it seems to be a bit too much to wear under makeup. The texture keeps a shine and tackiness to be worn under makeup. I also use it as a moisturizer on my neck at night and it seems to reduce the fine lines on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please keep me posted on new brands.</li>
    <li> I have received my eye cream and have been using it for about two weeks&lt;br /&gt;now. I love it! It&#x27;s so moisturizing, but not at all greasy. I&#x27;ve also been&lt;br /&gt;using it on a patch of eczema that I have on my chin and it seems to be&lt;br /&gt;working well on that, too. For the price point&lt;br /&gt;and the product, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> All ok, great seller.</li>
    <li> I had personal problems with the product, and was fully refunded by seller. She had really nice communication line, and was very personal and caring. Nice seller.. too bad the cream did not work for me, may be I had allergic reaction to it, I am not sure. the bottom line -  I am a satisfied customer.. )) Thank you LilyAna.</li>
    <li> This is a great product - moisturizes without being greasy and does not irritate my skin. I use it as a face cream as well as for my eyes!</li>
    <li> I like this eye cream. It is very reasonably priced (major point for this!). It feels nice when I put in on, doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and it&#x27;s not greasy at all. It also doesn&#x27;t have a scent, which I love. I haven&#x27;t seen any major improvement in my under eye area (aside from the benefits that come with having that area well moisturized before going to bed), but I have only been using it for a couple of weeks.. Products take time to work, plus there is no magical solution for dark circles or puffy under eyes; all we can do is try to take good care of ourselves and have realistic expectations. In my opinion this is a good product, I will most likely re-purchase.</li>
    <li> Rich moisturizing eye cream! This is my third order. Better than any over-priced eye cream. Mix with MesmerEyes- lightens dark circles but is dry, and your eyes will look years younger. Many friends ordered after they saw what it did!</li>
    <li> This is a great eye cream. I use it at least 3 nights a week. It&#x27;s not too heavy or greasy feeling, and it has a light, fresh fragrance. You really only need to use a small dab on your fingertip and gently pat it around your eye. A little will go a long way, so this is an excellent value &amp; a quality product</li>
    <li> Not sure how I&#x27;ll like over the long run, for improving eye skin, wrinkles, or darkness--BUT it did irritate my eyes a bit the first few times I used it.  It&#x27;s not a thick cream at all, but does seem relatively moisturizing.  May learn to love?  IDK</li>
    <li> I am in my early 30&#x27;s so I use this as a preventative eye cream. Its light and glides on smoothly. I like to use natural products that are never tested on animals and so far I am very happy with my purchase. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This eye cream rocks! I have been using it for roughly a month and am noticing results. I have been trying out new eye creams and have not been able to find &amp;#34;the one.&amp;#34; I think my search is over. Seldom is one able to find an affordable great quality product. I highly recommend this eye cream.</li>
    <li> Love this eye cream...moisturizing without being greasy...fine lines are becoming less prominent</li>
    <li> Lovely product. Feels silky going on and absorbs quickly into the skin. It left my skin feeling very soft and smooth</li>
    <li> Nice eye cream. I can&#x27;t tell how much of a difference it makes but I feel like it is helping.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an eye cream that was natural and not tested on animals, which led me to LilyAna Naturals. It&#x27;s a nice eye cream. Moisturizing and non-irritating, no funky scent. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks, so I cannot comment on anti-aging benefits but it feels good on and doesn&#x27;t interfere with my eye makeup. The price is amazing for how much you get. I&#x27;m into it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful company, wonderful service. They even sent me a hand written postcard with a discount code!! I love this eye cream! I&#x27;ll never buy another. I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin and most products cause breakouts on my face. But I swear since I&#x27;ve been using this product (as an all over face cream, not just eye cream) that my complexion has actually improved, a lot! I love that it is all natural. We do not need to be putting chemicals, preservatives, and artificial anything on our skin - which absorbs what we put on it and delivers it to our bodies! Anyway, I LOVE this eye (face) cream. :)</li>
    <li> All natural and reasonably priced eye cream</li>
    <li> I like the ingredients and the amount for the price. I don&#x27;t notice any improvement for undereye circles or wrinkles, but it does keep the skin around my eye from becoming flaky. It&#x27;s also very lightweight so it doesn&#x27;t cause little bumps to form on my skin.</li>
    <li> Great cream, just a tiny dab is enough so this jar will last forever.  Be careful if you&#x27;re taking it traveling; it leaked a little bit in my bag, but not badly!</li>
    <li> This is a lovely eye cream.  The product is a feather light cream but soothes and moisturizes my eye area wonderfully.  I have sensitive, mature and dry skin and this lightweight cream penetrates and feels good on my eye area.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a bit now - it&#x27;s recommendation is to use it at night but I use it both at night and during the day!  Like that is has only a few ingredients and a great price!</li>
    <li> I received this for an awesome deal in exchange for a review. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now. I use is it as a facial moisturizer twice a day. It&#x27;s a simple clean and gentle moisturizer with a clean scent. I would recommend it for sensitive skin or allergy issues. I will purchase it again! I only wish it had some natural spf.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this eyecream. It leaves the eye area soft.  I also use it to soften laugh lines.&lt;br /&gt;Good buy!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moDVFEM1YVK4PH]]Amazing texture, great natural scent, GREAT for my oily skin! I&#x27;ve already seen the fine lines around my eyes go down! I want to stay looking young, and with this cream, I&#x27;m certain that I will. This is one of my favorite products I&#x27;ve found on Amazon so far.</li>
    <li> The cream is very watery. There was a notice from the manufacturer that said to refrigerate it for a day or so if that were to happen (due to warm temps in the delivery truck I guess). I refrigerated it for three days. It was a little better straight out of the fridge, but after sitting for a little bit is back to a near liquid state. Not what I expected.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is great for the eyes! I also use it on my face and neck as well! I have dryness around the eyes and this cream has corrected that! I like the natural ingredients. Highly recommend using this cream!</li>
    <li> I love this product. This, along with the face cream, has made my skin feel very soft and hydrated.</li>
    <li> I love this cream!  Yes, it is a small jar, but it only takes a tiny bit.  It spreads nicely, plumps up the skin, and keeps skin soft and supple.  I use it around my eyes, on lines above (between) my eyes, on my upper lip, just below the creases of the corners of my mouth, and of course, my neck (which is actually why I bought it).  I am 70 years old, and it is clearly the best cream I have ever used!  I wish it came in a larger jar.  Next time I will order more than one.&lt;br /&gt;Just two weeks later and I have ordered another jar of this amazing cream so I can have some in each bathroom. I have extremely sensitive skin, and this creme does not sting or burn at all.  It has been hard to find facial products that do not cause me discomfort.  This one is a winner!</li>
    <li> I only used this product for two days and can tell it is a lightweight and airy type cream.  I really like it and will leave update later after I&#x27;ve used it for several weeks.</li>
    <li> I was a little leery about this eye cream.  But the more I use it the better I like it.  I have problems with black circles under my eyes they are not gone (only been using a week)  but the circles seem to be fading.  I will continue to use it.  I love the way it makes my skin feel.  It is creamy and not oily!  I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Nice cream. Not too heavy. Unscented which is great.  My eyes are very sensitive but this cream doesn&#x27;t bother them at all</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;This is a really good eye cream, it goes on smooth, its not greasy and dries thoroughly. It seems to help with inflammation and puffiness around the eye area as well. &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s simple, inexpensive, and it works well.  I like how it makes the fine lines disappear...and I use it on my entire face, not just around the eyes, because it makes my whole face feel soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe the difference in what used to be dark circles under my eyes.  Really works great for me.  Haven&#x27;t tried anything else, but would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I love the softness on my skin and love the scent</li>
    <li> I have tried many eye creams in the past. I was actually using a celebrity skin care line, but was not pleased with the eye cream.  This is far superior.  It is gentle, but powerful.  My under eye area is moisturized and firmer. I will purchase again, and I&#x27;m excited to try other products in the line.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this moisturizer, I&#x27;m giving it the 5 stars that it deserves.  Great moisture, supple skin, radiant skin etc etc etc.</li>
    <li> Love the size and value. I have to be careful though because it burns my eyes if I apply too much before bed.</li>
    <li> I am SO pleased with this facial (eye) cream! It&#x27;s so soft, creamy and ultra moisturizing! I have been using it daily and love the way my skin is feeling! THANK YOU for a great product</li>
    <li> This is a really nice eye cream. I does make the slightest difference using this along with your regular moisturizer. Cost wise is much less expensive then the higher cost creams but this has more natural ingredients which I prefer. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the small jar because a tiny dab under your eyes goes a very long way.</li>
    <li> This is an exceptional product. I can tell a difference even over the short time I&#x27;ve used it. LilyAna Naturals provided ample communication about the Eye Cream. The light fragrance is wonderful! I saw some reviews about people&#x27;s eye&#x27;s burning, but that only happens if you put too much too close (it still is a lotion afterall...). This is a great value and I&#x27;ve loved it thus far.</li>
    <li> I like this eye cream, it doesn&#x27;t burn around my eyes like some products do. Soaks into the skin and leaves my skin feeling soft. Good price. I would order this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this eye cream a few times now and it works beautifully for me.  I find I don&#x27;t need much to get great results.  Their customer service is also very professional and helpfu!</li>
    <li> I like the cream, it&#x27;s thick but absorbs quickly &amp; feels fresh!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the eyecream for four months and still love it. It&#x27;s definitely worth a try for all you fence dwellers!  I mainly bought the cream because of the natural ingredients it uses, but it turns out the the main ingredients (aloe and coconut oil) are organic.  Even better!  The cream also smells lovely and has a great texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company even sent me a hand written postcard to ensure that I was satisfied.  I have never had customer service like that when ordering from Amazon.  It was so refreshing in this era of impersonal e-commerce.  Thank you, Sheryl!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about the product is that it is bottled in plastic.  I would totally pay a couple bucks more for a glass&lt;br /&gt;container without all the toxin-potential that plastics can have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company even sent me a hand written postcard to ensure that I was satisfied.  I have never had customer service like that when ordering from Amazon.  It was so refreshing in this era of impersonal e-commerce.  Thank you, Sheryl!</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I got it. But... Not for me. No changes ... :(</li>
    <li> This cream is very nice and emollient. I usually use it during the day, as my skin is so dry that I need the extra thickness and protection of the cream. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a two weeks along with the face moisturizer and I definitely notice a difference. I&#x27;m very sensitive to eye products, but this is mild and has a delicate smell, unlike some other products that are infused with strong perfumes. During the shipping process the oil in the product separated, but the company gave me a heads up about this, via email, and suggested mixing it and putting it in the refrigerator--that did the trick. I recommend this product, especially for those who have sensitive eyes/skin.</li>
    <li> It is light yet moisturizing. Love it! Thanks for pricing it just right so I wasn&#x27;t afraid to try it!</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream! I have highly sensitive skin especially around my eyes that can easily break out in eczema, so I have to be extremely careful of what I use! So I was pleasantly surprised how well my skin did it just drank it in and actually improved my skin! I deffinately will be purchase the Eye Cream again and reccomend it to anyone who has sensitive skin It deffinately helps!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased the eye cream for my wife (age 59), and she is pleased with it.  The scent is light and clean, and true to suggested usage, the neck area also benefits from the cream.  According to my wife, it is difficult to find an eye cream that leaves skin smoother and younger looking the next morning but does not cost at least half of a day&#x27;s wages.  She will be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> Super creamy and non greasy.  Very smooth on my skin.  Definitely will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have been using the eye cream for about a week now. I&#x27;m only 22 so i can&#x27;t say anything for the wrinkles. My eyes  are moisturized but in a non greasy  way. The eye cream soaks in very  well to the skin. Overall i am very happy with it and will gladly order your other products. Your  eye creams are in comparison to other brands I&#x27;ve spent a small fortune on. I do have sensitive skin and i had no reaction  to it as well. Rosehip is also very moisturizing for the skin. Another plus the container is huge!</li>
    <li> Seems to be a really good quality product so far. Works at least as well as the Cinique eye cream I was using previously. I really like that the ingredients are more natural. Less expensive alternative to the big name brands and has a nice consistency. This eye cream has won me over as a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> Smooth, rich, tames those fine lines &amp; it&#x27;s a great price. Just a lil dab will do ya👍</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;The reason I give it 4 stars is,because I just started using it,and so far so good in term of smooth and silky application,and It didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Im very happy with this cream. Not just for eyes but as an all over moisturizer. I have super dry skin. This cream has been helping a ton. Looking forward to trying more products  by this company</li>
    <li> allergic reaction, made my eyes very swollen.  Customer service was very helpful and gave instant refund</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Once I started using this product consitently on a daily basis I have noticed a remarkable difference, esp with my dark circles.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This eye cream has just the right weight and feel. It&#x27;s not greasy at all and feels wonderful on my skin. I use it at night as well as before applying makeup during the day. I have used it on the rest of my face too! I can highly recommend this product and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I really like this eye cream:  It is light, silky, moisturizing, and a little goes a long way.  I also like that it doesn’t have a strong scent, and the price point is so reasonable.  It is a wonderful product as far as I am concerned, and this is a small company that provides excellent (and friendly) customer service.  I will definitely continue to purchase this cream!</li>
    <li> These are good products,  great ingredients.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in both my face and my eyes  moisturizer. Ibe seen a difference in my skin tone. I&#x27;ve just ordered the face cream and received it.</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer and lovely seller.  A tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for about 3 weeks, &amp; I can already see results! The lines at the corner of my eyes appear finer, &amp; my eyelids are not as puffy. The absence of the harsh ingredients is definitely noticeable with this product, leaving my skin feeling soft &amp; irritation-free! This product does what it says!!</li>
    <li> Thick and creamy. I use all over my face.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is all one would want, and nothing more. I am a consultant for high end skin products, which my mother in law loves. She, however cannot use the eye cream my company sells, due to severe sensitivity partially caused by shingles.  Lilyana has minimal, and all natural ingredients, which comfort and refresh this area. From the minute she tried Lilyana, she knew it was the right product for her: it&#x27;s light, and nourishing. I also work with, and study aromatherapy. The blend here of herbs and oils is exquisite.</li>
    <li> Since I got it a couple weeks ago, I&#x27;ve been using this eye cream twice a day. So far, it&#x27;s been gentle enough to use on my eyelids and neck (also using it on my face) and no breakouts or rashes! Even Vaseline will leave my eyes with a red scaly rash after a couple days, so I&#x27;m thrilled to find something gentle enough to use on my eyes.  Love the vintage-looking label, too.</li>
    <li> Very nice product at a good price</li>
    <li> This is called an eye cream, but it&#x27;s one of the best all over face creams I&#x27;ve ever used. It goes on very smoothly and has made my skin really soft. Extremely happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Customer service is A+. Even though I cannot use the product, they let me keep it to give to my Dad AND gave me a refund. The scent made me cough. I&#x27;m just very sensitive to scents in general. I liked the consistency--smooth and easy to put on. And the jar is huge compared to other eye creams I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Really, just as others have said, I did notice an almost immediate improvement.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is just wonderful! It is soothing, helps to remove makeup and literally... my eyes look brighter after use of this product. I&#x27;m hesitant to apply cream to my eyes, in general. Eye cream with chemicals  may be damaging from what I&#x27;ve heard. So I tried this organic, handmade eye cream. Cautiously optimistic, I was taken back by glowing results. I apply this cream in the morning after my shower, under and on my lids. A while later it looks as though my eyes look smooth, soft and bright. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. I use it all over my face also. Excellent eye cream.</li>
    <li> Rich and luscious without being heavy!  Absorbs beautifully, really just an excellent, excellent eye cream! I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and highly recommend it!  Pleasant word of warning, a little goes a long way!  Use a light touch &amp; it&#x27;ll be perfect!</li>
    <li> I bought the moisturizer for my mom for Christmas, gave it to her early because she was complaining of dry skin and it works wonderful for her aging skin. I would recommend it for anyone who wants something light and very easy on sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this eye cream. It is light weight and non greasy and yet I feel it does a great job moisturizing the skin around my eyes. I have been using it for about two weeks now and my eyes look refreshed and I do not have puffy under eyes anymore. You get a large amount for the price, a great bargain. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This eye cream was a liquid consistency, and super runny. I did not like it, but since I spent the money on it I went ahead and used it all. It did not seem to moisturizer well. I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve used for about four days switching back and forth between my regular brand of eye cream. I like that the product is all natural and decently priced. I will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> I liked it so much I used it all over my face.  I love that the ingredients are natural as my skin is very sensitive.</li>
    <li> I use this over my entire face and absolutely love it! Leaves skin very soft. A+ for this product!</li>
    <li> Thin ,but that&#x27;d be fine ,it burned my skin puffy ,red .Sad ,it really feels nice on my hand before I applied to eye area .I even tried three times ,just in case .</li>
    <li> Second time I ordered this product. I love this cream and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I purchased both the face cream and the eye cream and, I must say, I love both of these products!!! I have noticed a marked improvement in the texture of my skin. I will definitely be purchasing more in the future, some for me and some for my daughter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the customer service is excellent.</li>
    <li> I love that this product is made with natural moisturizers. However, I have found that my skin around my eyes is super sensitive and I would wake up itchy and the coconut oil caused me to breakout. I should have read the ingredients completely before using because I am aware of that sensitivity. I really tried to like this product because it felt great going on. I know I am an anomaly, it&#x27;s just not right for me.</li>
    <li> Really liked this product. Makes my skin so soft.</li>
    <li> I love this eye ceramics moisturizes well and is none greasy. I use it all over my face not just my eyes. I can tell a difference in the over all appearance of my skin.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Not greasy.</li>
    <li> I love this natural product!!</li>
    <li> Loved this product. I have been using it for over a month a notice a real dofference. I gave les linea around My eyes And they are not So dark!</li>
    <li> Very nice and light eye cream and feels really nice on my skin.  Very happy that the ingredients are natural!  For the quality of the product it is a very reasonably priced product.  I most definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Very Pleased! Within a week, I could notice a softening of the fine lines around my eyes. My skin is extremely moisturized with this! I&#x27;ve tried Murad eye creams in the past, and never got 1/2 of the result I&#x27;ve gotten with this cream.  It soaks in nicely, and rather quickly. I have been wearing it under my makeup as well- gives a dewey look around my eyes. Will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream!  So soft and silky!  I feel it has really helped the delicate skin around my.eyes.  I have enjoyed ordering from this company!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know what the rave is on Facebook&lt;br /&gt; I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.</li>
    <li> I have the eye cream and, have been using it for a few weeks.  I use it at night before bed, and in the morn, before putting make-up on.  Works great.  Tried using it on entire face, but, it is too greasy!</li>
    <li> Dark Circles are gradually disappearing and skin under eye is softer. Will be trying face cream next...This is the first thing that ever worked for me so I&#x27;m really excited!</li>
    <li> Favorite cream ever!! My skin is super sensitive and though I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s I still have &amp;quot;combo&amp;quot; (dry and oily) skin prone to breakouts.  I bought this to try on some creases that were showing up around my eyes. I soon found that I liked the feel of this so much. That I tried it on more and more of my face. Now I use it on my whole face and down to my neck. Usually I won&#x27;t go out the door without full makeup but I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about 2 1/2 months now and lately I&#x27;ve been able just use a bit of mascara and lip gloss!!  That is huge!!  No need for all the concealer and foundation I used to have to use. Sometimes I still use it but not to cover my face.  Now it&#x27;s more to enhance it.  I have ordered  a 2nd jar and am really hoping this wonderful product is never discontinued. &#x27;</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Will be buying this again</li>
    <li> Just received this eye cream on a promo so the price was cheap!  Great eye cream!  Emollient, soothing, very rich and creamy, hydrated great, organic and 85% all natural. No parabens or irritants.  Not sticky or greasy.  First ingredient is aloe so it is not heavy.  Very impressed with this product--will continue to use!</li>
    <li> Great stuff and works and shipped fast.</li>
    <li> Great product with affordable pricing.  Keeps the eye area fresh and moist all day! Wrinkles are much less noticeable and wrinkles lessen with use.</li>
    <li> Best eye cream I have used (and I have used quite a few). Love it!</li>
    <li> Good natural eye cream. Customer service is great.</li>
    <li> Great product and customer service</li>
    <li> This eye cream is light in color (white) and feels soft and creamy.  The scent is very mild and pleasant.  As the company recommended, I put it in the fridge upon arrival to thicken it up a little (I live in Florida).  If you are accustomed to heavier and thicker commercial products, this eye cream will seem very mild. Cudos to LilyAna for being a cruelty-free company!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this eye cream! It&#x27;s rich and creamy and my eyes love it! I have been using it for a little over a week now and have already seen a difference in the fine lines and dark circles under my eyes. I have also had a couple people tell me recently that I look &amp;#34;well rested&amp;#34;. I would definitely recommend this cream to anyone! :)</li>
    <li> Love it.  My eyes feel good all day.</li>
    <li> Great product! I love it and will purchase this again! Hoping they have other great products too!</li>
    <li> Although it has a good feel, It irritates my eyes. I now use it on my face and neck only.</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye cream for several weeks now.  It is gentle and I have even put it on my face.  It is light and does not leave my pores clogged.  It is creamy and has a natural feeling.  It is odorless and perfect for the very sensitive skin that I have.</li>
    <li> This product has become my favorite eye cream! I see a difference immediately after applying. You get a good sized amount, a little goes a long way. Can&#x27;t wait to try other products from this brand.</li>
    <li> It feels great, just perfect</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this eye cream. It is heavy but not super greasy. I use it morning and night. I have really sensitive skin and love how gentle it is.</li>
    <li> This may work for some people, but it caused me to break out and get Milia. It is very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> burns my eyes !!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> smells nice &amp; doesn&#x27;t interfere with my contacts/ sensitive skin. makes my skin feel great all day!! will post before &amp; after pics in about a months time. also, the tiniest dab&#x27;ll do ya, as they say :)</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  Does not sting the eyes but it very moisturizing.  Pretty jar and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Used and used and really did nothing for me....</li>
    <li> Beautiful container, great eye cream, fantastic price and was shipped very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;The cream is a perfect consistancy, it is not very heavy or greasy and it is not in a liquid form.&lt;br /&gt;Once applied it soaked into my skin without leaving a shine or residue.  When picking this product out on Amazon, it had a good explanation, but when I ordered, I was also sent an email explaining how to properly put it on and it was also explained it can be used on my neck and face. That is great customer service.  I think this product is fantastic and was a great price for the multi uses of it. Once the jar is done, I will buy more, but I will use the container to put jewelery in or put on an endtable or shelf.</li>
    <li> The only negative statement I can make is that this product is really a lotion not a cream.&lt;br /&gt;It would have been nice if I had known this before I opened the jar and it spilled out all over everything.&lt;br /&gt;It is a good product, I have very sensitive eyes and have a hard time finding  eye products I can use. This doesn&#x27;t irritate&lt;br /&gt;my eyes and seems to be effective. It is a great moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;The price is great, over all I am very pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have great customer service. Since first review LilyAna sent me a new eyecream. It is thicker.&lt;br /&gt;After trying various high-end eye creams, this is a nice change. My eyes had started getting that crepey lid look. This product moisturizes and tightens.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since ordered another jar to have on hand. I&#x27;m very happy to have found this product.&lt;br /&gt;It is a good size and a good price. High-end creams cost 5 times what this does and sometimes are&#x27;t as effective.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> I like a really rich, almost &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; eye cream...and, if that is what you like, too, then this isn&#x27;t the cream for you.  However, I adored how my eyes felt after using it!  They felt refreshed and hydrated almost immediately, and after a week of use, I could see less fine lines!  Way to go, eye cream!!!</li>
    <li> Great cream, pure, non-greasy moisturizer, fragrance free</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK...I was expecting MORE moisturization. It makes skin soft but if I&#x27;m going to use it beneath my eyes and neck (which they encourage you to do), I really need more hydration. Pro&#x27;s...it&#x27;s creamy, no fragrance and arrived quickly. Came sealed for protection. Con&#x27;s (so far) not very moisturizing and very bad outer packaging...Amazon often just throws these products into flat boxes where the ends are barely closed and not even taped.</li>
    <li> Very rich so I only apply at night but it works great!  Hydrates, smooths, reduces puffiness.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a simple moisturizer and, have to admit, I bought this product along with the face cream because I liked the packaging.  I really like these products.  The cream absorbs into the skin and leaves my face feeling supple and soft.  I am sensitive to  many skin care products, but I have had no negative reaction to these.  I plan to buy both the skin and eye cream again.</li>
    <li> Creates such a nice smooth finish on my eyes ... It almost seems to brighten my under eyes as well . I don&#x27;t know how well it works on fine lines. But it&#x27;s super moisturizing and I belive keeping your skin super moisturizerd really helps with preventing wrinkles and the appearance of fine lines. No smell as well ,plus !</li>
    <li> I really do like this cream. It keeps my skin dewy feeling and I feel like it gets absorbed well. I am considering buying their  face cream now!</li>
</ol>
