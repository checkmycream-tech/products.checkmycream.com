      <li>I know what jojoba smells like, or kind of, since I&#x27;ve never seen jojobas up close.</li>
      <li>So when I received an offer for this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review, I did not hesitate.  </li>
      <li>all my opinions are my own.</li>
      <li>I found the scrub a bit strong, though it does have a pleasant citrus scent, as does the serum.</li>
      <li>These are amazing products and I have tried many others.  </li>
      <li>Let me start out by saying that like so many others that are reviewing InstaNatural&#x27;s products, I also received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased feedback.</li>
      <li>A wonderful cream that will help with acne and help clear up your skin.</li>
      <li>Not overpriced,  like some of the more famous skin companies.</li>
      <li>I have noticed my skin is way more softer ever since i started using this.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Love this brand and love their customer service.</li>
      <li>ABSOLUTELY LOVE  </li>
      <li>I do wish the glycolic acid did more for my skin because in all honesty, I didn&#x27;t feel the acid working, but I did notice results from the vitamin C.</li>
      <li>Many glycolic serums run $40-50 for 1 ounce, so id been reluctant to try one before this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Apply more like a serum and press it into the skin.</li>
      <li>I know there are many reviews on here from customers who receive the products for a discount.</li>
      <li>I love that InstaNaturals added Vitamin C because it synergizes with the Glycolic Acid to both soften and nourish the skin for an even, brighter, more radiant glow.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>These three ingredients along with some very powerful hydration g ingredients (Hyraluronic acid and CoQ10) make for a cream that is working wonders for my skin!</li>
      <li>Which is good since I plan on stocking up on this ;-)</li>
      <li>I am sure by the time I am done with my first bottle I will look amazing .</li>
      <li>Do your research, look at the ingredients, and I genuinely think you will be pleased with the results you find here.</li>
      <li>Great product .. Leave my skin so soft .. 😀</li>
      <li>I like the fact that  Instanatural products contain a variety  of natural ingredients  that together  work amazingly!  </li>
      <li>Would have been nice to know this before I bought the first bottle.  </li>
      <li>I gave my honest feedback and they responded back thanking me and also sending a complimentary refill (Treat your customers right and Company will do great :) )</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of glycolic products now that I&#x27;m in my mid-30s.</li>
      <li>Makes your skin feel so smooth.</li>
      <li>When  I apply  it evenly on my face it absorbs  really nicely  and fast.</li>
      <li>I use it in the evening after toner and serum, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, I don&#x27;t have pimples and my skin is smooth.</li>
      <li>and I enjoy the feel and smell of it.</li>
      <li>The jojoba oil has a trace of scent; some companies remove the scent completely, but it&#x27;s good</li>
      <li>So far so good.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m excited to continue using this, the ingredients can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
      <li>* Make sure you really rub it in since it is orange!</li>
      <li>For those that aren&#x27;t familiar, Bearberry extract is an astringent that minimizes pores and lightens pigment and has a history as a way to fade freckles.</li>
      <li>This is a great moisturizer for anyone that has dry and sun damaged skin.</li>
      <li>I got each of these products for review at a $1 each, I&#x27;d imagine that paying the full retail value would run quite steep, also considering I am used to pharmacy brand and Neutrogena products.</li>
      <li>Maybe this will be a good option for people who are just starting to use AHA</li>
      <li>I love many of instanaturals products and this is no different.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased numerous products from them in my year+ as a customer and have never been more satisfied in my skincare.  </li>
      <li>The orange color will quickly disappear as you apply the lotion.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Its absorbed quickly and the orange does go away.</li>
      <li>This cream is great because it&#x27;s not too heavy when applied, and even after rinsing it out my skin felt</li>
      <li>They are a new company and in order to help generate some buzz about their new products they are building &amp;#34;brand ambassadors&amp;#34; by offering people the opportunity to test their products at reduced prices in exchange for an honest review.</li>
      <li>That being said, we are all free to post our honest opinions and there is a reason that InstaNatural&#x27;s products are garnering such high marks (4.5 to 5 stars) on their products being sold on Amazon...</li>
      <li>It actually makes my skin look nice/glory immediately after applying, but within just a few days (twice a day) it has most certainly made my skin look more radiant and bright.  </li>
      <li>Very low level glycolic but great for daily use.</li>
      <li>My skin is left fresh and more refined.</li>
      <li>line: Scrub, Serum, and Lotion with care and made sure to read the instructions and suggestions prior to use.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I absolutely love this Glycolic cream and can&#x27;t wait to see how radiant my skin will look after I&#x27;ve used the entire bottle!</li>
      <li>THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I absolutely love this Glycolic cream and can&#x27;t wait to see how radiant my skin will look after I&#x27;ve used the entire bottle!</li>
      <li>does exactly it says it does and exfoliates the skin.</li>
      <li>Glycolic Acid Cream is an absolute must-have!</li>
      <li>It did do and excellent job in moisturizing and hydrating my face, but unfortunately didn&#x27;t do anything else for me.</li>
      <li>THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST!</li>
      <li>ACTUAL LOVE</li>
      <li>It really behaves like a primer for me, and since I cannot wear most primers due to the &amp;#34;cones&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s a fantastic skin-loving alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall keep up the good work on these products, it&#x27;s a definite recommend.</li>
      <li>really do the feel the texture is better with only using this at night on my forehead.</li>
      <li>I am a chef and spend my days sweating in 100 degree kitchens, but  my skin stays clear and beautiful through the use of this and other Insta Natural products.</li>
      <li>Also, it worked really well as a hot oil treatment to prepare the skin for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I use 1 pump pretty much every night</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> re: Vitamin C Cleanser&lt;br /&gt;100% Pure Certified Organic Jojoba oil&lt;br /&gt;10% Glycolic Acid Cream&lt;br /&gt;Skin Brightening Scrub&lt;br /&gt;Skin Bfightneing Serum&lt;br /&gt;Skin Brightening Lotion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great line of products. I created my own routine with them and it&#x27;s working out great. Look forward to sampling other items. I used the Vitamin C Cleanser twice a day; morning and night. It left my face really light and moisteurized. The lather is quite leathery so it does not drip so I also used it as a five minute mask. I added some 100% Pure Certified Organic Jojoba oil when using it as a mask for a deep cleanse/conditioning. The jojoba oil has a trace of scent; some companies remove the scent completely, but it&#x27;s good it smells some, that way I know what jojoba smells like, or kind of, since I&#x27;ve never seen jojobas up close. Also, it worked really well as a hot oil treatment to prepare the skin for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit concerned about the orange color of the 10% Glycolic Acid Cream, until I read the &amp;#34;tips and directions&amp;#34; email, which stated that&#x27;s the color it&#x27;s supposed to be. my concern was I didn&#x27;t wanna look like I got a fake tan. Then I read the part about the sun exposure, at which point I decided to rinse it out after ten minutes. Its absorbed quickly and the orange does go away. This cream is great because it&#x27;s not too heavy when applied, and even after rinsing it out my skin felt moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;Anytime I see &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; on a product I think of the crazy celebrities that bleach their skin to truly ugly and quickly noticeable results, that act like they look great and nothing&#x27;s wrong. So I approached the &amp;#34;Skin Brightening&amp;#34; line: Scrub, Serum, and Lotion with care and made sure to read the instructions and suggestions prior to use. The Skin Brightening Scrub I used twice a week, and the Skin Brightening Serum and the Skin Britghtening Lotion every other day, twice a day. because I have recurring acne I found the scrub a bit strong, though it does have a pleasant citrus scent, as does the serum. The lotion also has a trace of citrus scent. In combination, I found the line to help recede the acne noticeably after each use. As I never used a serum before I wonder if the filmsy texture after it dries is a natural occurance of using a serum? Or did I use too much? a little goes a long way on the lotion: the first few times I used way too much, now I use it one pump at a time.&lt;br /&gt;Since I got each of these products for review at a $1 each, I&#x27;d imagine that paying the full retail value would run quite steep, also considering I am used to pharmacy brand and Neutrogena products. For the time I&#x27;ve been using them, I did find these to work really well for me. it could be that my face had hit a &amp;#34;product plateau&amp;#34; and using new ones gave it a little something extra? Overall keep up the good work on these products, it&#x27;s a definite recommend.</li>
    <li> YAY! I love this glycolic acid cream ! I makes my skin pink after wearing it all night. My skin is left fresh and more refined. I can actually see some areas of my skin more pink in color.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Very low level glycolic but great for daily use.</li>
    <li> I would suggest trying this. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 12 days with other InstaNatural products and instantly I notice that redness around my nose is going down, skin is smoothing, and freckles have started to shrink!</li>
    <li> I WAS A LITTLE SKEPTICAL  ABOUT  GLYCOLIC  ACID BECAUSE I  HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN. BUT FOR THE SUMMER I THINK I WOULD LIKE TO TRY SOMETHING OTHER THAN MY USUAL  VITAMIN C. SURPRISE SURPRISE... I ACTUAL LOVE THIS, I ONLY USE THIS AT NIGHT , BUT IN THE MORNING,  MY SKIN IS SOOOO SMOOTH, AND GLOWING. ABSOLUTELY LOVE  IT.  DON&#x27;T FORGET THE SPF IN THE MORNING, THAT&#x27;S A MUST WHEN  USING GLYCOLIC ACID PRODUCTS,  I WAS  GIVEN A CHANCE TEST THIS WITH A DISCOUNT,  BUT MY  OPINION IS UNBIASED AND HONEST</li>
    <li> This Glycolic Acid Cream works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have uneven, hyper pigmented skin from old acne scars that just refuse to fade away. I also have adult acne so I&#x27;m always adding to the dark spot collection. What I can stand the most is that my pores are the size of craters in the moon! It&#x27;s almost impossible for me to wear makeup because it pools in my pores and just makes me look horrendous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glycolic acid works wonders to treat these problems along with dullness, dryness, and early aging signs. I love that InstaNaturals added Vitamin C because it synergizes with the Glycolic Acid to both soften and nourish the skin for an even, brighter, more radiant glow. In addition to these two powerhouses, they also added Bearberry extract! For those that aren&#x27;t familiar, Bearberry extract is an astringent that minimizes pores and lightens pigment and has a history as a way to fade freckles. These three ingredients along with some very powerful hydration g ingredients (Hyraluronic acid and CoQ10) make for a cream that is working wonders for my skin! I use it at night after I&#x27;ve watched and toned my skin. The results have been instant although they&#x27;re not where I want them yet. I&#x27;ve had coworkers comment that my skin looks brighter and one person even said I had a pregnancy glow. Still trying to figure out if that was a backhanded weight remark...lol anyway here are some tips I&#x27;ve learned and though to share so you can get the biggest benefit from this amazing product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I apply the Glycolic Acid Cream to clean and dry skin after my toner and serums but before my night cream&lt;br /&gt;* I gently massage a quarter size amount of cream onto my face, neck, and up behind my ears until it has completely absorbed in&lt;br /&gt;* Make sure you really rub it in since it is orange! The orange color will quickly disappear as you apply the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;* I have sensitive skin so I only use the cream once a day and only at night.&lt;br /&gt;* After the product dries apply a moisturizer with sunscreen if you use it during the day! THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST! This product contains an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) that may increase your skin&#x27;s sensitivity to the sun and particularly the possibility of sunburn. Use a sunscreen, wear protective clothing, and limit sun exposure while using this product and for a week afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I absolutely love this Glycolic cream and can&#x27;t wait to see how radiant my skin will look after I&#x27;ve used the entire bottle! I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for a honest, unbiased review.  Which is good since I plan on stocking up on this ;-)h sunscreen if you use it during the day!

I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for a honest, unbiased review.  Which is good since I plan on stocking up on this ;-)</li>
    <li> My skin is super sensitive and prone to adult acne.  Acne products make my skin dry and dull, and exacerbate my fine lines (I&#x27;m 45).  I first started buying Instanatural products last spring when I tried the Niacinimide and the anti-aging/acne serum in hopes of curing my acne without Benzoyl Peroxide and haven&#x27;t looked back.  I&#x27;ve purchased numerous products from them in my year+ as a customer and have never been more satisfied in my skincare.  They don&#x27;t contain artificial fragrances (which I hate) or silicones/dimethicone (which is in EVERYTHING and makes my skin break out). So when I received an offer for this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review, I did not hesitate.  I have had a very hard time finding anti-aging products that don&#x27;t irritate my skin (and actually provide results!) and have literally spent thousands over dollars in the past few years on the journey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is orange, and have a slight sweet scent (natural sort of maple syrup or something) and absorbs nicely into my skin.  It actually makes my skin look nice/glory immediately after applying, but within just a few days (twice a day) it has most certainly made my skin look more radiant and bright.  The size should last about a month using twice a day, but might not make it through a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that this glycolic serum is priced really well compared to others I&#x27;ve seen, and without the problem ingredients I steer away from.  I&#x27;m going to out this into my regular rotation along with my other faves.  Many glycolic serums run $40-50 for 1 ounce, so id been reluctant to try one before this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also find that this makes a great &amp;#34;Dimethicone free&amp;#34; primer under my foundation.  It really behaves like a primer for me, and since I cannot wear most primers due to the &amp;#34;cones&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s a fantastic skin-loving alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to add that I know there are many reviews on here from customers who receive the products for a discount.I cannot explain how irrelevant the price has been to me.  When it comes to good quality products, I am accustomed to paying much higher prices for lesser quality and poor ingredients.  Do your research, look at the ingredients, and I genuinely think you will be pleased with the results you find here. I am not affiliated with this company, but I&#x27;m a true believer due to what the products have done for my skin in only one year :)</li>
    <li> A wonderful cream that will help with acne and help clear up your skin. Making the end result baby soft skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A glycolic acid cream benefits a variety of skin complaints.  It’s a great way to exfoliate.  When used regularly, glycolic acid can fade fine lines and skin discoloration like age spots.  Theses creams are typically mild and unlikely to cause irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer! Makes your skin feel so smooth.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this out, and replaced my regular 10% AHA with this cream. I expected it would maintain my skin&#x27;s condition as if I were still using my regular cream. I really didn&#x27;t see that. If you have used AHA before, you will notice that a few days after you stop using AHA, your skin starts to go downhill (same with using this cream). It did do and excellent job in moisturizing and hydrating my face, but unfortunately didn&#x27;t do anything else for me. Maybe this will be a good option for people who are just starting to use AHA (it seems to be a gentle formula?). Wish it said what the ph of their product was, on the packaging, and for those who don&#x27;t know, they should write that for AHA to work it should be used in completely dry skin (water neutralizes the effects of AHA).  *I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased feedback.</li>
    <li> Love it ! Makes my skin look great</li>
    <li> I like this cream, it absorbs nicely.  and I feel like my sunspots are fading a bit using this.  I have sensitive skin and this cream has not caused and redness or any burning sensation, which I have gotten with other glycolic skin care.  I use 1 pump pretty much every night and I have been using it for about a month.  So it is lasting longer than I thought it would.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for almost 2 weeks now, morning and night and I have not noticed any improvement. I wrote to the company and was told I would need to use it for at least 2 months before I could expect to see any results.  Would have been nice to know this before I bought the first bottle.  Who can afford to keep buying these products and using them for 2 months to see if they will work or not?  I can&#x27;t, even if they guarantee a refund if you&#x27;re not happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Let me start out by saying that like so many others that are reviewing InstaNatural&#x27;s products, I also received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased feedback. However, necessarily let that dissuade you if you are on the fence! They are a new company and in order to help generate some buzz about their new products they are building &amp;#34;brand ambassadors&amp;#34; by offering people the opportunity to test their products at reduced prices in exchange for an honest review. That being said, we are all free to post our honest opinions and there is a reason that InstaNatural&#x27;s products are garnering such high marks (4.5 to 5 stars) on their products being sold on Amazon... they are great products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Glycolic Acid Cream is an absolute must-have! This cream hydrates like nobody&#x27;s business, but it&#x27;s totally gentle and still brightens the complexion. It&#x27;s kind of like a little miracle in a bottle! My skin was in rough shape after a bout with benzoyl peroxide... dry patches that would not be quenched with any ordinary moisturizer. But this little bad boy took control over night and started to make improvements in a matter of hours! Now I use this every night and it&#x27;s still gentle enough give my skin just the right amount of hydration and boost it needs to look it&#x27;s best each day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks InstaNatural... you&#x27;ve got another home run on your hands with this new product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased feedback.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of glycolic products now that I&#x27;m in my mid-30s. This product doesn&#x27;t disappoint. I use it in conjunction with the many other instanatural products and I know it&#x27;s working for two reason - it keeps my breakouts at bay and my friend remarked that my makeup goes on smoother and looks natural.</li>
    <li> I use this sparingly on my sun-damaged chest, it has an orange tint so be sure to rub it in!</li>
    <li> These are amazing products and I have tried many others.  The company is great to work with and will go to great extremes to make the customer happy.  Highly recommend the products and the company!</li>
    <li> This is so velvety smooth, it glides over the skin and soaks in well, and seconds later I notice myself wanting to feel my skin again!  It is wild how soft and supple the skin feels.  It is a light orange color, and a little goes a LONG WAY, doesn&#x27;t stain skin. I use it in the evening after toner and serum, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, I don&#x27;t have pimples and my skin is smooth. I haven&#x27;t used this daily, I estimate about every other day, but I&#x27;m definitely wanting to go to everyday and hope that before it gets too hot/sunny out that my skin will have adjusted to it (due to the AHA&#x27;s making skin more prone to sunburn). I&#x27;m excited to continue using this, the ingredients can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful  cream that works ! I have been using it one&#x27;s  a day. It is a creamy  orange color cream.When  I apply  it evenly on my face it absorbs  really nicely  and fast. The orange color fades  away. It is non greasy and odorless! It keeps  my face moisturized and it feels  smother. I haven&#x27;t  experience  any type  of irritation. I noticed  that the pimples I get ones a month actually  heal faster and the red marks disappear  faster. I like the fact that  Instanatural products contain a variety  of natural ingredients  that together  work amazingly!  Thank you  Instanatural  for allowing  me to review is amazing  cream in change  of my honest  unbiased  review.</li>
    <li> Perfekt thing for pure skin</li>
    <li> MY EVERYDAY FACE LOTION</li>
    <li> I have used it for a week, haven&#x27;t noticed big changes.  I will keep using it. It seems like I have less brow spots.</li>
    <li> Great product!! Love this brand and love their customer service. 10 stars!!!</li>
    <li> Great size of the bottles a lot of product for a razonable price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the product I purchased, My skin feels fresh and flawless. I&#x27;m happy with the purchase and already looking up for more products of InstaNatural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had an email from AJ founder of Insta Natural asking me how the product was working for me. I gave my honest feedback and they responded back thanking me and also sending a complimentary refill (Treat your customers right and Company will do great :) )</li>
    <li> Great product .. Leave my skin so soft .. 😀 i want to order another bottle of it hopefully i get discount for that</li>
    <li> I been using the Glycolic Acid 10%, Vitamin C for almost 2wks I have no see much different .....</li>
    <li> This is my favorite moisturizer, I usually use it in the morning, and the skin brightening one at night. I am a chef and spend my days sweating in 100 degree kitchens, but  my skin stays clear and beautiful through the use of this and other Insta Natural products. I don&#x27;t even need to wear foundation anymore. It blends in easily and evenly without leaving any residue, and is smells delicious too.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I don&#x27;t use it more than once every other day because it slightly irritates my skin. However, my skin is VERY sensitive. it makes  any pimples I have heal faster and my scars are already fading. I love many of instanaturals products and this is no different.</li>
    <li> Use every other day, love it</li>
    <li> NOT REALLY SURE HOW  GLYCOLIC  ACID  WILL  WORK ON MY SENSITIVE SKIN . AFTER A FEW DAYS, I AM IN LOVE .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY SKIN FEEL LIKE I JUST HAVE A FACIAL DONE, VERY SMOOTH AND CLEAR. NO  REDNESS TOO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WAS OFFER TO  TRY THIS WITH A DISCOUNT,  BUT MY  OPINION IS UNBIASED AND HONEST</li>
    <li> Great for acne and acne scars</li>
    <li> Great product. does exactly it says it does and exfoliates the skin. I have noticed my skin is way more softer ever since i started using this. If youre looking for a exfoliating cream with glycolic acid deff try this one out.Comes at a great price. Not overpriced,  like some of the more famous skin companies. This one is as good  or beter for a fraction of the price. I was offered to try this product out for a low cost for a promotion. all my opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer for anyone that has dry and sun damaged skin.</li>
    <li> This is a nice moisturizer that evens skin tone out nicely and I enjoy the feel and smell of it. I do wish the glycolic acid did more for my skin because in all honesty, I didn&#x27;t feel the acid working, but I did notice results from the vitamin C. Also, do not rub vigorously or it won&#x27;t sink in as well. Apply more like a serum and press it into the skin. This is nice to mix with my SPF in the morning because it helps not look so pale with its orange tint.</li>
    <li> Been using this for three weeks now. My forehead is my main concern. The skin on my forehead is very rough not deep wrinkles just rough texture.&lt;br /&gt;I really do the feel the texture is better with only using this at night on my forehead. I will purchase again. Love this company!!</li>
    <li> Have been using for a few days.  Use twice daily, at night with no sunscreen, during the day with sunscreen. So far so good.  My only complaint whic is a major complaint, I realized after opening it that the bottle was half full. WIll contact customer service</li>
    <li> I love this product. it has transformed  the texture of my skin in just two week.  I am sure by the time I am done with my first bottle I will look amazing . will be Palin another order this week so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
