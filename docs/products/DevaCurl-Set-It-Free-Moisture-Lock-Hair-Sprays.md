<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> so great for my curly hair. really keeps frizz out</li>
    <li> Great product for curly hair.  I even use it when I straighten my hair to prevent flyaways.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend for curly hair. No disgusting chemicals either. Not sticky. Smells nice.</li>
    <li> Love the No poo and conditioner, but this product as a leave in left my daughters hair feeling little thick and sticky, not light and smooth as expected.</li>
    <li> My fiance has very course, curly hair and he loves this stuff. Defines curls and makes hair softer.</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair and this product is great.  Creates curl and eliminates the frizz.  I&#x27;m a Deva Girl.  Love it!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite Deva Curl products! Moisture plus soft curl definition.</li>
    <li> On the fence with the product.  I could live with or without it.  I can refresh my curls with water for free... But this product wasn&#x27;t bad.  Not sure if it&#x27;s worth the expense since I didn&#x27;t see a noticable difference in my curls moisture daily.</li>
    <li> I have very curly and dry hair and this product leaves my hair crunchy&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s my first time using a devacurl product and i feel disappointed...</li>
    <li> Talk about helping with the fizz!!!  This stuff works.  I spray it in while my hair is wet and it really helps with the texture.  My hair is course and curly, this product feels like very watered down conditioner.  It lighty sprays on and helps define your curls.  Its great!</li>
    <li> Set It Free is a really great product by DevaCurl. You can spray it on your hair, wet or dry. When dry it can be used even as a texturizer, which is really fun. When wet it help your hair stay shiny and silky and gives it some extra bounce. It won&#x27;t make your hair curly, but if you already have curly hair it&#x27;s a great product that will help you maintain your hair in a healthy gorgeous way. So you can get different results by using it different ways. I highly recommend the product. On top of it, it has an amazing smell. I just LOVE the way it smells. Nothing like it.</li>
    <li> I like the way this product makes my hair feel.  Usually use it just before leaving the house for the day.</li>
    <li> I like Biosilk Rock Hard Gelee better</li>
    <li> Always great, love, love love this product for my type 3 a curl.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried most of the products in the Deva line, and while I use and like the LowPoo and One Condition in the DEVACare line, and I like to refresh with Mist-er Right, and I use B-leave In to refresh with conditioner on 2nd and 3d days, and I like Arc Angell, THIS STUFF DID NOTHING as promised. Frizz was not reduced. Moisture was not locked in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, granted, I have dry 3b hair with high porosity. Maybe it works better on lower porosity hair or less dry hair. But for me, nada. Zip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does smell nice, though. That earns it at least one star. I have one bottle that I&#x27;ll finish up--I use it when I use Mist-er right to add a layer of nice scent, citrus over lavender. Careful not to spritz too much, or your hair gets a dull, sort of waxy feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, really,can&#x27;t recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;IngredientsAqueous Extracts of: Achilea Millefolium, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria), Cymbopogon Schoenanthus, Humulus Lupulus (Hops), Melissa Offcinalis (Balm Mint), Rosmarinus Offcinalis (Rosemary), Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Isopropyl Myristate, Acrylates/C12-22 Alkylmethacrylate Copolymer, Ceteareth-20, PVP, Beeswax, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Lipids, Sodium Hydroxide, DMDM Hydantoin, Fragrance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products for curly hair and find this works best for me. I use this after the shower or on dry hair and it works great. I find it works even better when you pair it with the cream but either way it&#x27;s fabulous.</li>
    <li> Love it. Curly girls need this to keep the frizzy hair away!</li>
    <li> I love all the deva products, but this one is the only one that I just can&#x27;t live without.  I have curly, dry, dense hair and this stuff really conditions and tames it without weighing down the curl- in fact I think it enhances the curl a bit.  I have tried many, many leave in conditioner products and this one is by far my favorite.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to get behind the Deva products. Ive had my hair cut at their salon and it was amazing. I got the Shampoo, Con, gel, moisture spray, the lot. I found the whole line really heavy and makes my 3B curls look really greasy. I only use the conditioner as a leave in now and again the rest of the stuff is wasting space in my cabinet. The moisture lock just make my hair smell like a lemon. Even though these products are marketed towards all curl types from wavy to kinky I have never seen a lady with 3 or 4 type curls that have been happy with them. So if you can get a Deva cut go for it but skip on the products.</li>
    <li> This product is great! It makes your hair smooth and is not oily. I use this to spruce up my hair after using the Deva no-poo and conditioner. It is amazing for your hair and worth the cost!</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff--It do two light sprays, one to the surface of my hair, then one with my head flipped over. I do this after doing the No-Poo, One Condition (one pump in shower, one drop as leave-in), then 1/2-1 pump of the Light Defining Gel before drip-drying. I apply this once my hair is almost to completely dry. I will sometimes repeat around the 3rd day (I wash twice weekly). I will say that over-applying will definitely lead to some weird dandruff-like flakes, though. It does have a strong smell, but I personally like it, as does my boyfriend. It&#x27;s not so much a styling product, as a maintainer (prevents frizz) and refresher (helps my waves/curls hang together again after a couple of days), so keep that in mind. I have fine/thin 3a-3b curls.</li>
    <li> Hadn&#x27;t used this before and ordered it mainly due to its small bottle but it is a terrific product.  Gives good definition without the heaviness.</li>
    <li> I have 3b curls that look more like 3c in high humidity, mostly corkscrews with some botticelli waves too.  My hair is fine, but there is lots of it.  Past my shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love this product.  Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because, unlike most other reviewers, I find the smell to be too strong.  Granted, I have lots of allergies so my nose is probably more sensitive.  But I deal with the scent as this works so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product 2 different ways:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. On dry hair, this will fix a bad hair day (frizz, stringiness, some curls fell straight, etc.).  Sometimes I spray in my hands then smooth over the offending sections of hair, give it a little scrunch, and it will dry in 30 minutes or so into shiny curls, like magic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. On wet hair, after leaving most of my One Condition in, I will scrunch out some water, then spray my hair thoroughly with Set It Free (maybe 12 pumps).  This was my routine when I lived in humid Florida and I actually had shiny, bouncy curls that would last at least 2 days with some slight refreshing with the spray.  Only thing I don&#x27;t like about this routine is that your hair stays wet for a long time (I don&#x27;t diffuse) and it is expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my routine with it now is to fix bad hair days on dry hair.  It&#x27;s just more affordable and I live in a colder climate now and don&#x27;t want my hair wet all day.  Angell and B&#x27;Curls didn&#x27;t work for me but I Love SIF.</li>
    <li> This whole line is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Had not used before. Like it in dry and wet hair!</li>
    <li> Love this product I put it in after I have washed and condition my hair it helps keep the frizz at bay</li>
    <li> Once again, I was sadly disappointed with Deva. This spray (like the Deva Curl Mister Right), left my hair feeling sticky. I didn&#x27;t see where the \\&quot;moisture\\&quot; and \\&quot;oil\\&quot; came in. It left me just wanting to go through my hair routine all over again. The smell was okay, but what&#x27;s that mean if the actual product doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s supposed to?! Sorry Deva, but I will NOT be buying this again, feels like they use some sort of \\&quot;glue\\&quot; in this. I will stick with real natural oils like jojoba and argan.</li>
    <li> Set It Free can be used on wet or dry hair to define curls and hold in moisture all day.  It reactivates gel and it helps curls bounce into shape without frizz.  This can be used throughout the day on my hair, because my hair is so dry.  Set It Free smells like Key Lime Pie, so my hair looks and smells fresh.</li>
    <li> Works great on my daughter&#x27;s thin curly hair</li>
    <li> You really don&#x27;t need too much of this spray.  I have shoulder length hair (when wet) and typically spritz about 8 times all over my hair and then scrunch it.  The product leaves your hair feeling really soft and your curls bouncy. It&#x27;s also great the next day to touch up your curls. One of my favorite products.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!    I no longer have to apply triple...sometimes quadruple layers of hair product to keep it frizz free and soft.  No more crunchy and crispy curls either.  I just wash my hair, spray and go!  Careful with over-dosing, though.  Hair can get gunky if you go overboard with application.  Scent is wonderful, too!</li>
    <li> I am a Deva girl and use a lot of their products on my type 3b (fine, very curly) hair. Set it Free is an essential product for me and works well in two ways: 1) as a leave-in conditioner that I apply before the Light Defining Gel, and 2) on second or third day hair as a moisturizing refresher in combination with the lavender-scented product whose name escapes me at the moment.  I have to apply with a light hand otherwise this product can be heavy on my very fine hair, but light and even application is easy thanks to the spray nozzle. This is must-have, non-negotiable product in my haircare line-up.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair that is on the thin side so I have to use something that won&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  This is a great product - it enhances my curls perfectly.  I normally just put this in my hair when it is wet and let it air dry - even being in humid Florida this works great.</li>
    <li> While this spray gives a slight hold, it&#x27;s definitely not an effective substitute for gel/mousse. It would probably work well to control fly-aways, but it doesn&#x27;t work to control all of my hair on its own. (I have very thick, curly hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like that it&#x27;s light and can be used on dry hair, which is good for when my hair needs a bit of boost later in the day or the day after washing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this smells really good. It smells exactly like Skittles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a better product for the price, but maybe I had the wrong expectation for it.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Helps to control the frizz halo.</li>
    <li> I struggled with the thought of carrying my heavy Canon 5D on my cruise trip in Europe--even to the point of replacing it, because it has been such a burden to carry.  As a desperate, last ditch effort I ordered the Joby strap for Women.  I am amazed that I was able to carry that camera full time on many tours and many miles of walking in Rome, Naples, Marseilles, etc.  My camera was always ready for that quick shot.  I actually had a woman in Rome take a picture of the strap with the name so that she could order one when she got home.  In the past my shoulder and neck would hurt after carrying my camera, but not a twinge!!  Thanks Joby for designing a strap that distributes the weight just for women!!!!</li>
    <li> GREAT product. Delivered on time and not left where dog could open first.</li>
    <li> This product worked great for my hair when it was short.</li>
    <li> Applying right before hair drying helps the curl to draw up so much better than when not using this product.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have used it for several years, and it helps keeping my curls in shape, but not making them feel sticky or hard. I recommend this to anyone who has curly and frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> This product is great. I just wash, towel dry my hair spray with SET IT FREE and let it dry. If I need a touch up just spritz a little and your good to go. This stuff is great in the summer.</li>
    <li> too sticky feeling for my fine wavy hair</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t live without this product...The difference between happy moisturized curls or dry frizzy curls..</li>
    <li> my favorite deva curl product. My hair is curly but not very course or thick so the curls will get limp easily. This product will rejuvenate them and bring them back to life. I do however wish it smelled alittle better. It also can tend to be sticky.</li>
    <li> After using for a few days, this product left a large amount of build up in my hair. Also, it leaves my hair feeling oily which transfers to my face and made me break out. I would suggest only using this product on the ends of your hair. I would not purchase again because the effects did not last long enough and it was too oily for me. I have 2C/3B curls.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t go without this spray.  I use it faithfully after washing my hair.  Over time, I have noticed a huge difference in my hair&#x27;s moisture.  It isn&#x27;t so frizzy but will dry in nice curls.  It doesn&#x27;t leave any heaviness or stickiness either.  The smell is great, too, kind of a lemon-lime fresh scent.  I absolutely love the Deva Curl line but I think this product is my favorite.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got fine, frizzy, color-treated hair.  It is just The Worst. I usually blow it dry then straighten it with a flat iron because all the other curly hair products that I&#x27;ve tried either leave it limp or looking like a crunchy 80s perm. Set It Free gives me bouncy, shiny, beachy waves.  No crunchiness at all. The way I use it is: I blow dry my hair while combing through with my fingers, then spray this on (maybe 10 sprays over my whole head), then I give my hair a few squeezes.  Instant, soft waves that last all day.</li>
    <li> Deva Curl works wonders for my fine limp hair, giving it lots of volume and body.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Love it. Easy to apply, hair has a lot of curls, and helps to control the frizz.</li>
    <li> Not really a fan.  Dries out my curls.</li>
    <li> I really like this.  It does what it says.  It takes my frizz away.  I spray it on before I leave the house in the morning and my curls look great all day.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great &amp;#34;freshener.&amp;#34;  I don&#x27;t use it after I get it out of the shower.  I use it a day or two after I wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have 2B wavy/curly hair.  This product smells soooo good.</li>
    <li> I know people always rave about DevaCurl, and I&#x27;m here to tell you there&#x27;s good reason. Honestly, it&#x27;s worth the money. My curls are healthy, happy, and hydrated.</li>
    <li> I love using this product - gives a little extra moisture as needed and helps lessen frizz.</li>
    <li> While I absolutely love this product, I do have some down-points about it. I use immediately after applying my AnGEL to wet hair after my shower, I let my hair air dry as recommended and then after it&#x27;s mostly dry I spritz some more on. While it does add shine and definition to my curls, I feel like it also weighs them down makes them heavier, and adds a slightly oily look to my hair sometimes. I would still absolutely recommend this product, but use sparingly.</li>
    <li> This product was like spraying glue in my hair. It gave my curls a very dry/powdery appearance and made them so hard that I could barely separate them. There was not any moisture to the spray and I can&#x27;t figure out a purpose where I would prefer to use this product at any time - especially with how dull it left my hair looking. It was not for me - curly 3/3b hair.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, curly hair and most products either weigh down my hair so much it has trouble keeping its curl or dry it out so much it gets frizzy. Before DevaCurl I had the most luck with Redken Fresh Curl shampoo, conditioner and curl boost spray as well as L&#x27;Oreal Leave-In Conditioner for curls, but even that combo would dry it out a bit too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My stylist recommended the DevaCurl product line &amp; I am so grateful. It is very moisturizing without being heavy &amp; even the most frizz-prone bits of my hair have spiraled into perfect curls. I tried using some DevaCurl combined with the above-mentioned other brand products I already used &amp; that was an improvement, but once I switched to exclusively DevaCurl stuff every aspect of my hair &amp; curls improved. No, Deva Concepts does not pay me. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, this stuff works wonders! My curls are very happy with me now.</li>
    <li> Continue to purchase over and over again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Of all the Deva products I&#x27;ve used, Set It Free and the cream are superior for a soft hold without a gunky feel.  I&#x27;m not too fond of any product&#x27;s smell, including this one, but Set It Free doesn&#x27;t smell that strongly.</li>
    <li> I use this as my everyday frizz tamer because it does an adequate job. It&#x27;s a great value for what it does and the fact that it&#x27;s gentle on your hair. It has a stronger scent than I&#x27;d like, one that I don&#x27;t necessarily care for, and it overpowers my perfume. I&#x27;m on the fence as to whether I&#x27;ll continue using it or look for something I like better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On important days, I use a combination of WEN styling creme and oil, and generally my hair is so smooth, shiny, and silky on days 2 and 3 that I don&#x27;t need to rewash my hair if I don&#x27;t want to. If WEN products were cheaper, I&#x27;d use this combination every day. I see a lot of similarities between the WEN and Deva Curl lines, although it seems as though Deva Curl spends less on marketing and more on making good products that are gentle on your hair, competitively priced, and can compete with high-end salon brands.</li>
    <li> Save your money and purchase this from a real salon! I&#x27;ve been using this product forever and always buy it from my salon but didn&#x27;t feel like making the trip. The product I received is a fake. I can tell just by how it doesn&#x27;t work on my hair like it should AND by the bottle. A sticker over the barcode is a sign of a counterfeit product. Save your money, spend a couple dollars more and buy the real thing that will actually WORK!</li>
    <li> This works to re-define my curls aftwr I&#x27;ve been out in the elements. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff like some of the other products.</li>
    <li> It does the job - but you need to spray a lot and I don&#x27;t like the smell</li>
    <li> I have enough products for my curly hair to open a small boutique.  So far, I love this one .  When my curls need a little perking up, I spray some Set It Free , and they look great again.  Often helps me avoid having to put my hair up the second day</li>
    <li> Perfect for my natural curly hair, gives my curls the ringlets I love without &amp;#34;the crunch&amp;#34; feel!</li>
    <li> Revives my curls with very little effort. Love the smell as well. Awesome product to try- it will be a staple in my hair routine.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Deva Curl!  It has transformed my hair from every day is a bad hair day to people coming up to me and complimenting my hair several times a day!  And this is my favorite product. It sets the curls so they don&#x27;t frizz for the entire day and doesn&#x27;t create too much of a &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; feel.  Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
    <li> Creates frizz free happy curls. Don&#x27;t know what I did before this stuff! It&#x27;s light but does leave a little residue so just be cognizent of how much you use.</li>
    <li> These is a great product for naturally curly hair - HOWEVER, watch the price.  If it&#x27;s over $18 just go to the store and pick it up.  If it&#x27;s $15 and on Prime Shipping then it&#x27;s worth the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend the Deva daily conditioner but I do like the shampoo.</li>
    <li> I just used this product for the first time on my day 3 hair and I&#x27;m pretty impressed. I was worried about the negative reviews this product had but i feel those people are either trying to use to much of it at once or are generally misusing this product. I have thick, long, S&#x27;wavy hair which i only like to wash once a week because I have dyed red hair. I get major frizz problems and shapelessness because my hair gets so dry after about 4 days of wearing it down. I just tried this and I noticed the moisture lock pretty fast! my frizz has reduced significantly and some shape bounced back and though the smell of this product out of the bottle is a bit to strong, once you put it in your hair (if you use it appropriately) the smell isn&#x27;t nearly as bad.. i actually like it! I used about 6 spritz of it on my hand and gently worked it through my dry areas. The product IS a little sticky and I noticed people complaining about that but if your hair is dry and actually needs this product, you wont feel it on your hair. It will feel hydrated, bouncy and happy!</li>
    <li> This is product is like frosting on the cake.  You can eat cake w/out frosting, but it sure tastes better with.  I use a variety of Deva products to &amp;#34;hold my curl&amp;#34; until it is dry.  Spraying this product on curly hair (especially in the winter) adds moisture and shine. Great way to top off your curl.</li>
    <li> My curls are so much more defined and less frizzy since I started using the Deva curl line of gels and spray.  It&#x27;s great. I&#x27;d highly recommend it.  The scent is also great but not over powering.</li>
    <li> Perfect for refreshing my hair.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This combined with the Deva Curl gel holds my daughter&#x27;s curl in place with minimum frizz even on a humid day. I have never found another product that works this well on her hair. Her hair is super thick, long and curly and she use to hate wearing it down, now she wears it down alll the time.</li>
    <li> It does not seem to help keep the frizz down. (Edward is my husband and he ordered this for me...Carolyn Pettit)</li>
    <li> the deva curly line is the best for us curly heads. I love the set it free because you can do a touch up at any time makes your hair soft and refreshes your curls a must have</li>
    <li> This is a Great Product for naturally curly/wavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;Use it Lightly, if you use to much it doesn&#x27;t work as well.&lt;br /&gt;Also, once you get to the bottom of the bottle the product doesn&#x27;t spray well.&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t a big deal, just order two bottles and pour the left over in the new bottle!&lt;br /&gt;That is how much I Love this product, I order at least two bottles at a time. (Free Shipping)!&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy.</li>
    <li> This product held my crazy hair without making it crunchy. If it held throughout the day, I would give it the fifth star, but my thick hair won in the end. Will still purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product a handful of times due to the fact that it made my hair extremely greasy. I typically can go a few days without washing my hair but when using this product I had to wash daily.</li>
    <li> This is a great &amp;#34;wake me up&amp;#34; for my curly hair in the mornings.  I use it everyday and get a great look quickly.  I spray it all over, bend over and scrunch my hair for a perfect look.</li>
    <li> Hated this stuff. I used it with the other Deva stuff but thus stuff left my hair feeling dirty and did nothing to help the curls. I pitched it! I love the shampoo and conditioner, but did not like the gel either. :-(</li>
    <li> My go-to hair product. You can use a ton before it gets crunchy. Works great on my super-curly hair.</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly and as described. This product is all I use now on my curly hair. Keeps it manageable and soft - no crunch, just curls!</li>
    <li> This spray was recommended to me by my hair stylist - I am in love with the smell and it really helps bring life back to weakened curls and reduce frizz!</li>
    <li> One of their newest products, I decided try a couple of months ago, I already have an emergency bottle on hand!  By far the best curl re activator I have tried, in my life!  Smells delicious too.</li>
    <li> I have been using Ouidad products and decided to give this a try since reviews were pretty good, but I&#x27;m not sure yet if I like it all that much. It has a nice smell, reminds me of an orange dreamsicle and it has an almost milky feel to it when spraying it on. It left my hair with bouncy, springy curls and I do have coarse, thick, frizzy hair but my curls were kind of bushy. I think I wasnt able to spray this on as well as I could because the nozzle on the bottle wasnt spraying too well so applying it wasnt on target with areas where I needed it most. My only other issue was with a 6 oz. bottle like this it goes fast and it isnt cheap.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair spray for curly hair that I&#x27;ve owned.  Is it possible to find a comparable drug store brand, though?  I think it might be.</li>
    <li> I love Deva Curl products!!! I especially like this one because it does not make my curls hard.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 years. I love it! Holds the curls in and adds moisture to my hair. Have recommended it to several women with curly hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the way it sprays out of its container so I cut it in half with water and put it in my mister spray bottle.  It has a nice smell and works really well.  I like it better than their gel.  Okay, I&#x27;ll stop rhyming now.  This is perfect for my fine, thick, naturally wavy, blonde hair.  I use it every day.</li>
    <li> This gives hair a fresh nice clean smell and helps it to curl more. Works well after shampooing while damp, or after waking without shampooing to active curl.</li>
    <li> I use this product on the day after I wash my hair.  Instead of rewetting the hair to bring the curl back, simply spray this on and scrunch.  The scent seems sweet at first but totally disapates after a few minutes.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. Period.</li>
    <li> Great product for curly hair</li>
    <li> great product great price</li>
    <li> If you have curly hair, this whole line is a must! I have had curly hair and by curly, I mean frizzy and large, this whole line has taken that all away! I now love my hair and it is now in real ringlets! My tip though is going to the deva website so that you can use the products properly</li>
    <li> I love Deva Curl! I have curly unruly hair and the Deva Curl system is the only thing that works for me. I won&#x27;t ever use anything else.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this product.. I really really did.. I have Very thin coarse wavy hair. This product smells wonderful (That is why I gave it 2 stars). This product made my hair feel extremely dry and dirty. I have used it twice, Once after washing while wet and once when dry to refresh.  I will not even finish the bottle that I purchased. Looking at all the other reviews it must work well for some. But it does horrible things to my hair..</li>
    <li> Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Expensive. Expensive.&lt;br /&gt;2. Inconvenience - Cant buy in bulk so have to shell out $15 for every 6 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. I have botticelli curls. It is hard to make them look shiny without adding crappy/heavy products. This product makes my curls look shiny and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;2. So NO frizz for upto 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;3. Adds shine without the oily feeling.&lt;br /&gt;4. Works like magic with ANGEL arc gel from Deva and its conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/22/12- This is still my most favorite that make my curls well defined and shiny. Everytime I wear a little more of this product my colleagues ask me if I got my hair set at a salon. Btw i use it sparingly because it is so expensive. So I mix up the conditioner+ angel + Set it free (in equal parts) and no crunchy curls.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this stuff.  I can&#x27;t say it actually moisturizes my hair, but the smell is amazing.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of really fine curly hair. Its good quality and it seems that it would be great for medium or coarse curls. Its just too heavy for mine.</li>
    <li> I really like it, some said it was sticky but I put a little water in it and its perfect.</li>
    <li> Nice anti-frizz formula that also adds shine.</li>
    <li> I recommend all the products in this line for curly hair.  They work great and really get a lot for your money.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I find the DevaCurl Gel products are much better at taming my hair, but this is still great.  I think this product may work best for hair that has a bit looser curl than mine.</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT ON MY CURLS... A PRODUCT THAT DOES WHAT IT SAYS .... WORTH THE MONEY!!!! A LIL GOES A LONG WAY...</li>
    <li> Best curling product ever. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year and will continue to do so. I used to use the Tres Semme mousse for years and am so happy I made the switch!</li>
    <li> Magic potion for curls! I LOOOOOOOOVE this stuff</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my daughter&#x27;s hair.  She fights with the frizz and this product brought back her curls.</li>
    <li> great product  would not be without  packaged in great travel container my good to go  solution for bad hair days plus part of my daily regimen</li>
    <li> I hate traditional hair sprays because they make me feel like I&#x27;m wearing a helmet on my head.  Deva&#x27;s Curl Set It Free helps to maintain your curls without that helmet-like feel.  This product takes away the fly-away nature of frizz and retains the natural curl you get right after shampoo and dry.  It is an indispensable product to me and I use it after every shampoo along with Deva or Bumble and Bumble products.</li>
    <li> I love this spray and this line! The gel and this spray are my favorite two styling products from this line. I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Finally something to help with the frizz!! This stuff is amazing! I noticed a huge difference after using it for the first time- would FOR SURE recommend this for curly hair that tends to frizz over the course of the day.</li>
    <li> Curl products never seem to work. I used this product for about 2 months and it didn&#x27;t seem to do what it is supposed to do. Very unsatisfied.</li>
    <li> I have used the Deva conditioner and cleanser for years.  This leaves my hair feeling weighted down by the thickness.  The smell is very strong and artificial.  I would not recommend.  I will go back to mixing the Deva conditioner with water in my spray bottle, which works much better.</li>
    <li> I love all the Deva products and this is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a super addition and it smells terrific too!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of curly hair which tends to frizz and dry out. This product enhances my curls and moisturizes my hair.</li>
    <li> unfortunately the deva curl isn&#x27;t what i had hoped for.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve only used it 5 or 6 times and the bottle seems to&lt;br /&gt;be almost empty. it&#x27;s expensive and not worth the money&lt;br /&gt;for what it does and how fast it disappears.</li>
    <li> This hydrates and actually produces waves. Great product, leaves hair soft not crunchy.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me. Minimal hold. Back to old routine. If wanting to try Curly Girl, Kinky-Curly is a MUCH better product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to do with this spray. It is supposed to add moisture and frizz control, but instead it felt as if it left a sticky, oily layer on my hair so that when I went to move my hair, pieces of my hair were stuck together which caused more frizz. Maybe this product wasn&#x27;t meant for my type of curls?</li>
    <li> My hair is very naturally curly.  I have tried this product twice since purchasing it.  It leaves a film on my hair and the feel after it dries is no pleasant.  I will not purchase this product or others similar from this company in the future.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair.  Although there are many Deva Curl products, this is the one that I use and like the most.  I wash my hair, spray it on my hair, and off I go!  I like the fact that it does not make my hair feel sticky! I do not like a lot of &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; in my hair.  I like the natural look.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying, I LOVE DEVACURL.  I especially love Set it Free, because it has saved me from serious pouf head this extremely HUMID and HOT summer.  In combination with No-Poo and One Condition, my hair is very moisturized and my curls have lovely definition!  I am so glad I found Devacurl and Set it Free!  I started with the travel kit, which i recommend ([[ASIN:B000QSDHPG B000QSDHPG]] I loved everything but anGEL, however tons of people have had great success with it.  If you have naturally curly hair, try Devacurl!!!!!  Mix and match products until you find the perfect combination for your hair type.</li>
    <li> Can not live without this product!</li>
    <li> I use it on my daughters curly hair. It transforms her hair so beautifully. It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue. It only takes a couple sprays to do its thing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give zero stars if I could. The product did the exact opposite of what it claims. Caused my curly hair to frizz up beyond what it does with no product. Later tried it on dry hair, and it made the frizz worse, also turning it into a knotty mess! Lousy.</li>
    <li> This gives great moisture to hair that is dry without using heavy creams.  Heavy creams causes you to rub in the product and most&lt;br /&gt;Ikely cause frizz.  What is the point of having nice curls and taking the time for braid/twist-outs if you are going to mess up your curls</li>
    <li> It is just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; in terms of results.  It goes on rather sticky, and the second you use too much, your hair will feel strange - dirty - all day.</li>
    <li> Set it Free smells great and makes my hair soft and shiny. I use it in place of styling gel.  It doesn&#x27;t exactly spray in an even mist since it&#x27;s more like the texture of a leave-in conditioner, but you can spray and scrunch or spray it in the palm of you hand, rub your hands together, and then run it through your hair.  Holds well enough not to have to use traditional hairspray and fights frizz and static very well!</li>
    <li> This product did absolutely nothing for me.  Tried to return it to seller crystalo*de*neve, however received a very rude reply from them, refusing my return request, &amp;#34;We just sell the product,  we do not make it. Sorry it did not work for you, but we can&#x27;t authorize this return.&amp;#34;  So, I guess I am stuck with an expensive bottle of spray that does nothing.</li>
    <li> If you have curly hair, you should try this product. It helps keep your curls in place all day. Use this with their other products.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and my hairdresser recommended this line of products to me. While I do not like the Deva Curl shampoo or conditioner (they dried my hair out and I did not like the smell of the shampoo and especially did not like the smell of the conditioner), I love the Set it Free and was so happy to find it on Amazon as it was much less expensive that what the salon was charging for a much larger bottle! I just spritz a little bit onto my damp hair, scrunch my curls and dry with a diffuser on a warm then cool setting until the dampness is gone and then let it dry naturally the rest of the way. I have had more people comment on my curls since I began using this product and they look so much more natural. It does not take a lot of the product to get the curls defined. The diffuser is an important tool as well and not drying the hair all the way as this causes frizziness. Continue to scrunch while diffusing the hair. I think this a a great, lightweight product that I would recommend anyone with curly hair to try. It has the look and consistency of spraying milk into your hair &#x3D; light.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what all the hype about this product is about.  It did absolutely zero for my hair.  I have natural waves and this lotion didn&#x27;t control the frizz as it promised and had no clear benefit whatsoever that I could detect.  I used this with the No Poo (which isn&#x27;t any better than VO5 Kiwi Lime Conditioner, a secret I learned from an online beauty review site) and the Arc Angell gel.  You would think that such expensive products would be better than the much more reasonably priced line I use (Got2be, which I like better) but they&#x27;re not.  I think these products are overpriced and the reviews suspect.  Maybe those with curlier, wavier hair benefit more, but this line was recommended by my stylist and I purchased all three products because he assured me they work better when used in conjunction with one another.  Hogwash!  Don&#x27;t waste your money!  For frizz, Got2be shine serum works like a charm and their Kinkier mousse is strong and the hold lasts all day and isn&#x27;t crunchy at all.  Buy yourself some wonderful perfume or some such luxury.  Your money would be much better spent somewhere else.  I don&#x27;t recommend this product or this line at all.</li>
    <li> Does not weigh hair down!</li>
    <li> I have kinda coarse naturally curly hair, I&#x27;m over 65 and have the remnants of hair coloring in my hair.  I mention all of that because I&#x27;m not sure how much those factor into my NOT finding this particular DevaCurl product helpful to me.  I&#x27;ve been letting the color grow out for about a year now and am just about ready to make an appt. to have a haircut (by a curly hair stylist).  Maybe once that&#x27;s done, I&#x27;ll find this product to be more beneficial to my hair.  I do LOVE most of the other DC products that I&#x27;ve tried and use them on a regular basis</li>
    <li> I love this to freshen up my hair at the end of the day and it smells so good.  I carry a small bottle with me too.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price,  fast delivery!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! It smells GREAT, very unique scent. I mix this with the Styling Cream and my hair is left smooth, frizz free and my waves are perfected. You can use this in wet or dry hair but I find that it weighs my hair down (and I have THICK hair, so nothing usually weighs it down) and leaves me feeling greasy when I use this in wet hair. That&#x27;s somewhat a given when you put a product like this in dry hair, though.</li>
    <li> daughter in law loves this</li>
    <li> Love this product for the day after a wash! Revitalizes your curly hair for fresh bouncy curls.</li>
    <li> I really like Devacurl products. I&#x27;ve stopped purchasing it, however; it&#x27;s just too expensive.</li>
    <li> This combined with the No Poo and conditioner make my hair look and smell fantastic.  Big, soft curls all the time now.  And so many compliments I wonder how bad my hair looked before.  No, I know how bad it looked before.  Horrible.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product! I use Set It Free the same way I use Mist-Er Right (which is also a good product)... but I like Set It Free even better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on dry hair on my non-shampoo days. Works great to repair flat and unruly &amp;#34;bed head.&amp;#34; Gives definition and helps control frizz. I spray a few pumps on my fingers then slide my fingers near my scalp to &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; my short curls at the roots. Then I spray a bit more on my hands and scrunch it in.</li>
    <li> I started using the Deva Curl Ultra Defining Gel which has hold but still seemed to make my hair feel frizzy, so I used this along side that, and it works well. BUT if you are using any stronger type gel like the Arc Angel don&#x27;t use this spray because it will make your hair sticky with a weird texture.  Another down side of this product is it&#x27;s so small, it comes in such a small size &amp; is just as expensive as other Deva Curl 12oz products, and if you have thick curly hair like mine you go through a lot. I recently had a Deva Cut and switched back to Arc Angel because it&#x27;s stronger &amp; my curl pattern has been corrected so don&#x27;t have much frizz. So while it&#x27;s a good product to use, it may just be more cost efficient to go with a stronger gel, but it will mainly depend on your hair type</li>
    <li> I only use Deva Curl products for my super curly hair. You can use on wet or dry, but it works best on dry hair.</li>
    <li> love all the Deva Curl products I have tried. The Set it Free lotion is a nice finishing step after using the no-poo shampoo, one conditioner, and ultra hold gel. It softens the hair and allows you to smooth the last frizzes away, and it smells great.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, I just wish I didn&#x27;t have to order it in such small quantities--I ordered two bottles in the 6 oz size after discovering that I love this when I tried it from the travel set. A little bit goes a long way ,it smells good (but not overpowering) and definitely makes my curls (which are looser/wavy) look more defined. My boyfriend even noticed that my hair looked &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34; when I used this stuff. Recommended!</li>
    <li> I was really hoping to love this product. I ordered it and waited patiently (impatiently) for it to arrive because I was beyond excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However it just didn&#x27;t do the trick. It makes my hair look greasy and flat. It&#x27;s almost like it weighs it down. For what I paid for it I am really upset about it. I really wanted to love this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does smell pretty good though. That&#x27;s about all the nice things I can say about it.</li>
    <li> I swear by this stuff! I have crazy curl hair and it tames frizz like no other! Deva products changed my life.</li>
    <li> I love this product for my curly frizzy hair, especially that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy. Just wish it came in a bigger size.</li>
    <li> Just an amazing product to keep your hair hydrated and never going dry or damaged. Has a very sweet unisex smell to it. The whole family uses it, we love it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray bottle itself is low quality, causing the liquid to come out in streams rather than mist, so spraying it directly on the hair gives uneven coverage. Best way to use it is to spray into my hands and then apply, but it makes the hands sticky until it&#x27;s washed off or dried. Also has really heavy, candy scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, while I did notice some shine, there was zero frizz control, and I don&#x27;t need to go through all this trouble for a bit of shine.</li>
    <li> For my 3b hair:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Really does make 2nd or 3rd day curls look closer to what they looked like on wash day.&lt;br /&gt;- Not crunchy.&lt;br /&gt;- Not oily.&lt;br /&gt;- Smells good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Expensive.&lt;br /&gt;- Small quantity.&lt;br /&gt;- Not as much of a moisturizer as I&#x27;d like. While it makes the curls snap to, it&#x27;s more like a really light gel than a moisturizer, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I always get compliments from my friends and strangers on my hair and ask me what I use for my hair. I naturally have curly hair. But this beauty makes my hair Look more intense in a positive way. I use it first before the conditioner one.</li>
    <li> It has really calmed and protected my hair.</li>
    <li> So in love with this product line and set it free is the best!!! It&#x27;s the only product that allows me to not wash my hair every day. I usually wake up with my curls all crazy but I use this to deactivate them and they look perfectly spiraled!!! I love it!!! I love DeVaCurl!!!</li>
    <li> At the same time I ordered their shampoo I also ordered the Deva curl set it free which is like a hair spray but is not stiff. It keeps my curly hair in place without being stiff. My hair smells so great that I don&#x27;t mind being next to someone and bending over to talk to them. Amazon shipped out this product just as fast as the shampoo. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It truly boosts and hydrates your curls. I also love getting it at a great price. Much better than water for adding life to curls.</li>
    <li> I used the entire deva curl line. No poo, one condition, mister right, light defining gel and this. This product is key for making sure that my curls are defined and frizz free. I spray some on before I apply the gel, then I dry and spritz a little more. It is perfect!</li>
    <li> I love Deva Curl products! Set It Free helps keep my curls in check during the hot and humid summer. It&#x27;s awesome not frizzing out all the time now.</li>
    <li> Great product and receipt my purchase quickly.  Will use this vendor again.  This was a great find!</li>
    <li> The shampoo (Low Poo) and conditioner (Ultra Creamy) are wonderful. If I&#x27;m going out at night after having my hair done from the morning, I revive my curl with Set it Free and just walk out. Looks like I just did my hair again.  Totally worth trying. Use it on dry hair.</li>
    <li> As with the Mist-Er Right, this product makes my hair gummy and sticky.  I&#x27;m hoping with the continued use of the No-Poo and the One Condition, my hair will improve and I&#x27;ll be able to use this product (sparingly).  All the products smell wonderful.  I can see this one with the Mist-Er Right being excellent for people with thicker, longer hair. :)</li>
    <li> i love this product.  i get some many more compliments on my hair when i use it.  i never travel without it.</li>
    <li> The one Deva product I can&#x27;t live without. Some of the bad reviews seem to be from people who don&#x27;t understand that this product is not meant to do the same thing as a gel or mousse. In other words, it&#x27;s not a MAIN styling product. It&#x27;s a &amp;#34;freshener&amp;#34;, or to help control the halo of frizzies that you sometimes get. It&#x27;s a great product to use the second, third, fourth day (lots curly girls don&#x27;t/shouldn&#x27;t wash their hair more than a couple times a week) to freshen up the curls and it works great! I have thick curly hair that has become more course with looser curls since I stopped coloring it a few years ago. Some products have stopped working as well for me, but not the Set It Free!</li>
    <li> LOVE THE SMELL!! Leaves my hair soft, and bouncy. I can put it when it is wet or dry and still get the same results. After a full day of school, i come home and my hair isn&#x27;t tangled at all... which is a big deal since i&#x27;m mostly outdoors!</li>
    <li> This is the BEST product I have ever purchased for my hair. I have baby fine naturally curly hair, so most setting lotions and gels actually drag my curls down. With this product I just spritz it on VERY lightly over my air dried hair, then I literally lift the curl and waves with my fingertips, let it dry thoroughly again and it comes out looking wavy, soft and shiny and not at all frizzy.  I need only use a little hairspray on my bangs and around the crown of my head and that&#x27;s it.  No more plastering my hair with hairspray.  What&#x27;s truly amazing is that even after a night of sleeping on it, the next morning my hair still looks full, wavy and pretty!  It only requires a little touching up with a wide toothed comb and I&#x27;m good for the whole day!  I&#x27;m in love!</li>
    <li> Love every Deva product I use (this, shampoo and conditioner) for my curly hair.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product several times.  It does not leave your hair cakey in any way shape or form.  I find that it holds for the whole day.  A lot of times I will just go to bed with wet hair and then in the morning spray a little water on it and use the Deva Curl and it looks great!&lt;br /&gt;Only minor complaint is that sometimes the spray comes out in more of a line than a larger mist area.</li>
    <li> I like keeping this spray at work and in my gym bag to refresh my curls. It helps tame freeze without making them crunchy. It also smells good (like those soda pop candies?!) and doesn&#x27;t feel gross on my hands (just in case i get stuck in a situation where i can&#x27;t wash it off).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: It&#x27;s easier to use if you spray it in your hands then scrunch it into your hair.</li>
    <li> gives your hair body without frizz. I have super stringy , frizzy , straight hair.. this helps give it body in the summer</li>
    <li> I have fine wavy/curly hair depending on the day. This product is the best invention I spray it on dry and it turns my hair into the beachy look. It&#x27;s amazing it also makes ringlet&#x27;s in my hair. Lorraine Massey is the curly hair genius she def knows her stuff</li>
    <li> Great product and came right away</li>
    <li> This is just the right thing to spritz n naturally curly hair to get rice of the frizzy ends.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I use it when I wake up the next morning to refresh my curls. They last all day. Will keep buying</li>
    <li> I use Deva Curl AnGel as a daily hair gel (I have thick, fairly tight curls), but when I want a little extra definition and shine I reach for the Set It Free. This stuff smells WONDERFUL and goes on really light despite its creamy texture, and it leaves my curls feeling silky-soft and looking really shiny and defined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that the main difference between Set It Free and Angel is that the Angel just holds my my hair in whatever shape its in to begin with, whereas applying Set It Free will actually turn frizzed-out curls into soft, smooth ringlets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set It Free is also a great deal on Amazon (anywhere from $2-$6 cheaper than in my local salons), and a little bit goes a long way (though I wish it came in bottles bigger than 6 oz.). A great buy.</li>
    <li> Really loved this product so I purchased two bottles.  The first bottle I used worked fine, however, the second bottle will not spray.  The product oozes down the sides of the bottle like a cream making it impossible to use.  The price is much too expensive for an unusable product.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product and it does keep my  curls in place.  It IS a bit sticky though, so I usually only use it the day before I&#x27;m going to wash my hair anyway.</li>
    <li> This product is so wonderful and refreshing to my curls!!! It adds zeal, life, and luster to my curls!!! It&#x27;s a nice way to refreshing the texture of my curls during a humid day!!&amp;iexcl;</li>
    <li> This is a great product for your next day hair. All you need to do is spray it and your off. I highly recommend this product for people who have curly hair.</li>
    <li> got it quick.  love it to make my hair curly.  works great. I  have used this for a  couple yrs now and can use it  the 2nd  day on  my  dry hair to make it curl up and be soft again.</li>
    <li> Great for later in the day when your curls need a refresh and even better for second day hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got very wavy hair that your average curl product regularly just weighs down and makes look real trailer-trashy (sorry for the comparison lol).  I did a review search on Amazon and came across the Deva line; the price turned me off since I&#x27;m cheap, but with all the great reviews and a gift card in hand, I bought it and was very excited for its arrival.  The very first thing I noticed was the scent...smelled exactly like Skittles!  Unfortunately, the frangrance wore off pretty quickly, and was one of the few things I liked about it.  I will say, it did exactly what I needed it to - I had great shaped curls, not just waves, that were light, defined and most importantly, didn&#x27;t look or feel crispy.  I did have however a funky, grimey film on my hair that made it impossible to have second day hair.  Its definitely a keeper since it did what I wanted, but not very often simply for the texture it left in my hair.  Maybe next gift card season, I&#x27;ll just try another product in the line.</li>
