    <li> Great overnight moisturizer, skin feels great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a woman of color and started using this product about 6 weeks ago. I use it in conjunction with Refissa.  What a difference!  My skin appears to be much more supple, nice and plump and dewy.  I hadn&#x27;t seen my facial girl for a while. (about 3 months)  I booked a facial with her and SHE wanted to know what I had been using on my face, because it looked so good!  Definitely a product I will be using for a while!</li>
    <li> Saw results of smoother skin within 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed</li>
    <li> Excellent product, reasonably priced, arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> This product is great, it was recommended by my dermatologist back in June 2014.  My skin on my face was sun burned, discolorated, broken out and dull.  After using this product for 2 weeks my skin began to heal, now my skin is radiant and glowing.  This is the only product I use along with an Obagi cleanser and regenica advance rejuvenate.</li>
    <li> my customer mostly like this night cream</li>
    <li> she is more beautiful than ever</li>
    <li> My facialist recommended this and have seen a dramatic difference in my skin!  Will never be without it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 62 and have relatively good skin.  But lately I&#x27;ve notice deeper lines around my eyes and the corners of my mouth.  After using this lotion for about a month, I&#x27;m noticing some improvement, especially around my eyes.  I&#x27;m not interested in Botox (NOT a cruelty-free product, check into the production process if you&#x27;re an animal lover), or plastic surgery. So any lotion that makes my skin appear healthier and younger, is well worth the price. So far, this is my favorite.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I originally purchased it from my doctor&#x27;s office but she stopped carrying it. I like it much better than the TNS because it seems to be more moisturizing and I actually see a difference in my skin after using it. Plus it doesn&#x27;t have that funky smell like the TNS has.</li>
    <li> seems like a product I will continue with</li>
    <li> It is a wonderful product that actually shows a difference in your skin.  I couple it with the ReGenica Facial Rejuvenation Complex during the day for maximum and beautiful results.</li>
    <li> I have used this for about 15 days and have not seen any results, but I don&#x27;t think I have given it enough time. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot, but it goes far. I will be buying it again. My face does feel smoother.</li>
    <li> package change without notice, not what i want</li>
    <li> Been using it for 3 weeks. Makes your face soft and smooth. Need to use a bit longer to really see  the real effects.</li>
    <li> One step beauty product that is gentle and effective. A small amount goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I started using this couple of months ago, I can really notice a difference in my skin, plus it smells good.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product!  I use it nightly.  It works wonderful and you will see results.</li>
