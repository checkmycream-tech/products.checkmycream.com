      <li>The product itself is great ...</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>This spray gel is great.  </li>
      <li>The spray gel is fantastic and the price was very good, but I most probably won&#x27;t order any more d/t the HIGH price with shipping &amp; handling!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure they will be ordering a lot more of this product to keep the hair where it belongs...</li>
      <li>This product was for the wife and daughter, they both us and love the Aussie products.</li>
      <li>I have not been able to find it in stores, so i was glad to order on-line.</li>
      <li>I am so glad to have found this.</li>
      <li>Love, love, love this spray.</li>
      <li>Glad I have a place to order it.  </li>
      <li>it did good enough</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t find this product in any store in my area - so nice to be able to buy it on amazon - works really well without making your hair feel stiff - can be combed out and hair is nice again</li>
      <li>so I was lucky to find it on line.  </li>
      <li>Great product, works well without weighing my hair down.  </li>
      <li>I love spray gel too, not messy.</li>
      <li>perfect for thin hair</li>
      <li>i used 20% of the bottle on the first day.</li>
      <li>I set my hair with hot rollers (I know, I know)</li>
      <li>Exactly what the lady likes.</li>
      <li>i could only order it in strong hold.</li>
      <li>and I use this spray gel which really gets me the height</li>
      <li>but I really needed it in maximum.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>This smells great, doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy, doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, and has enough control that I don&#x27;t generally need hairspray.</li>
      <li>This is the best styling product I&#x27;ve ever used but recently has become hard to find in local stores.</li>
      <li>I have very fine, limp hair and with a blow dryer, this works wonders.</li>
      <li>What I love about this spray gel is that it holds my hair all day, even in the high winds of West texas, yet it does doe make it look &amp;#34;plastered&amp;#34; down.  </li>
      <li>I am thankful to have hair in my older years, but it has thinned some.  </li>
      <li>I bought the product and love the way it lifted my limp hair.  </li>
      <li>it isnt worth sending back</li>
      <li>This is the first time I have ordered it from Amazon and the last.  </li>
      <li>It did cost more than I paid when it was carried locally, however having the right product that works for me was certainly worth the few extra dollars I spent.</li>
      <li>My hair is fine and limp.</li>
      <li>After trying many others, this is the one I settled on and have used no other for the past couple of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use this with electric rollers (YES, they work too and fast), spray the roots, put the rollers on, and 5 minutes later my hair looks glorious, no kidding!</li>
      <li>It is liquid in the bottle, so the spray is not very heavy like most spray gel that shoots out in a thick stream.</li>
      <li>Upon arrival I found one bottle to be full and the  others to be about half.  </li>
      <li>, all of the local stores who carry Aussie products seem to have stopped carrying this particular product.  </li>
      <li>There are few products that I am loyal to and  buy over and over.  </li>

<li> After a few emails back and forth with the distributor I gave up.!!!</li>
<li> I use this all the time, but it is hard to find locally.  </li>

<li> I&#x27;m looking for with this heavy, thick hair of mine.  </li>
<li> Not sure what caused the darkness</li>
<li> For some reason, Wal Mart and Target no longer carry this, at least in my area..................</li>

    <li> The product itself is great ...I have used it for years.  This is the first time I have ordered it from Amazon and the last.  I had ordered three bottles one for myself and two that I wanted for my friends to try as I had recommended It to them.  Upon arrival I found one bottle to be full and the  others to be about half.  After a few emails back and forth with the distributor I gave up.!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son, who is picky beyond words when it comes to hair products.  This is the one he likes.  What else can I say?</li>
    <li> Great product, works well without weighing my hair down.  Perfect!  I love spray gel too, not messy.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this spray. I have very fine, limp hair and with a blow dryer, this works wonders.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t go out of the house without this stuff in my hair. I would have no volume to my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought the product and love the way it lifted my limp hair.  It seemed to turn my hair darker because people asked if I was dying my hair.  Not sure what caused the darkness but I&#x27;m returning it to Walmart. Sorry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan</li>
    <li> For spray gel, this is the best. It is liquid in the bottle, so the spray is not very heavy like most spray gel that shoots out in a thick stream. For some reason, Wal Mart and Target no longer carry this, at least in my area..................So Amazon to the rescue.</li>
    <li> This smells great, doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy, doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, and has enough control that I don&#x27;t generally need hairspray. It&#x27;s hard to find in stores near me, so I&#x27;m psyched I can get it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> What I love about this spray gel is that it holds my hair all day, even in the high winds of West texas, yet it does doe make it look &amp;#34;plastered&amp;#34; down.  I am thankful to have hair in my older years, but it has thinned some.  This product seems to add thickness and volume to my hair.  I wash my hair, spray this on while still wet, brush my hair into place, and brush it out when I get to work.  The brush out eliminates the plastered down look, yet there is still enough hold to last the day.  After trying many others, this is the one I settled on and have used no other for the past couple of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas, all of the local stores who carry Aussie products seem to have stopped carrying this particular product.  So, I was joyed to find it online and ordered several.  It did cost more than I paid when it was carried locally, however having the right product that works for me was certainly worth the few extra dollars I spent.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time, but it is hard to find locally.  Glad I have a place to order it.  Thanks</li>
    <li> The only stuff that WORKS, without dulling your hair. I take it everywhere on my trips. My hair is fine and limp. I use this with electric rollers (YES, they work too and fast), spray the roots, put the rollers on, and 5 minutes later my hair looks glorious, no kidding!</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t find this product in any store in my area - so nice to be able to buy it on amazon - works really well without making your hair feel stiff - can be combed out and hair is nice again</li>

    <li> i could only order it in strong hold. it did good enough but I really needed it in maximum. why couldn&#x27;t I order it in maximum? also,strong hold is the only one I can find in the stores.why?</li>
    <li> Do not like this product for me.</li>
    <li> Exactly what the lady likes. How could I go wrong? :)</li>
    <li> This spray gel is great.  I can never find it anywhere so I was lucky to find it on line.  I set my hair with hot rollers (I know, I know) and I use this spray gel which really gets me the height I&#x27;m looking for with this heavy, thick hair of mine.  Great product.</li>
    <li> There are few products that I am loyal to and  buy over and over.  This is one of them.  This is the best styling product I&#x27;ve ever used but recently has become hard to find in local stores.</li>
    <li> i used 20% of the bottle on the first day. My hair didnt even hold in place while wet (it just feels like water) and was frizy and all over the place during the day. I left work at lunch time to buy some gel.&lt;br /&gt;at this price it isnt worth sending back but I want use the rest of it</li>
    <li> The spray gel is fantastic and the price was very good, but I most probably won&#x27;t order any more d/t the HIGH price with shipping &amp; handling!</li>
