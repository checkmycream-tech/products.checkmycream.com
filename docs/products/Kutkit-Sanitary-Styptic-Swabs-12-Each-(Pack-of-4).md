      <li>I use these styptic swabs frequently when I shave as a result of taking blood thinners.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product is the best of it&#x27;s kind on the market. It is so much easier to use than a stypic pencil. I used to be able to buy these at the grocery store but they no longer carry them. I am glad that this product is available online.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used pencils and they work great.  Tried to find them locally but got the runaround that they are no longer produced, swabs are better/more sanitary, etc., so I bought.  Finally tried them out and they SUCK!!  The swabs either break off completely or do not saturate with the fluid.  Most of the fluid is either wasted dampening the swab or stuck in the tube.  HORRIBLE product searching for an answer to a question no one asked.  Get a plain styptic pencil.  You can get a pack of 6 or so pencils for the cost for 100&#x27;s if not 1,000&#x27;s of uses.  Not 40 or 50 like these products.  And more likely half that since you&#x27;ll need 2 or more swabs each time you use them due to failures.</li>
    <li> Love these little things. How easy to use. No mess like the old days with that white chalky stuff. Easy to carry in a purse or suitcase.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item for a friend.  We couldn&#x27;t find this product in any stores so I went to Amazon to order it.  My friend takes Plavix and has trouble with bleeding.  This product is very effective stopping bleeding.</li>
    <li> This is a really excellent product. I first ran across it in some rural drugstore and was delighted to see that Amazon carries it. By far the best and most effective treatment for razor nicks and the like that I have ever experienced!</li>
    <li> This is a excellent product my husband used whenever he nicks his face shaving and he finds this product more effective than the normal chaulk pencils which crumble up when used.  This stops the bleeding fast and it sure looks better than the spots of tissue on his face!  Good product and cannot find in local pharmacies.</li>
    <li> I stumbled across these little gems at the grocery store (Publix) while living in Fl.  Moved to Boston and couldn&#x27;t find them any where.  Good old Amazon came through.  Styptic pencils are a pain and get messy.  These one time use items are great.  Clean and easy to apply.  Great to have a few in your travel bag.</li>
    <li> These are a wonder.  Sometimes I am in too much of a hurry while shaving and nick myself.  These swabs stops bleeding instantly.  They are very easy to use.  I used one for a small cut on my finger and it worked wonderfully.</li>
    <li> This works fine for minor cuts and bleeding, I had a bleeder that I went thru 10 of these trying to stop and it did not work, I would recommend for things like shaving nicks but that is about all it works on.</li>
    <li> RECEIVED AS DESCRIBED AND WERE MORE THAN PROTECTED - AGAINST DAMAGED. VERY PLEASED AND WOULD ORDER AGAIN FROM THIS COMPANY.</li>
    <li> This product works as advertised and stops bleeding from common shaving cuts quickly.  I would like to see it sold in a small bottle with a rinseable applicator instead of having to break open a Q-Tip type of applicator. It would be so much more simple.  Sometimes the liquid does not flow as needed.  Excellent chemical.....lousy delivery system....PSM</li>
    <li> These work a lot better than the styptic powder and don&#x27;t make a mess.  You snap a mini vial and one end of the swap and the liquid flows to the other end.  You then take the wet side and gently roll back and forth over the cut.  It stops the bleeding cleanly since the swap will absorb blood from the cut.</li>
    <li> Having struggled for years with the pencils that leave white gunk everywhere and don&#x27;t REALLY stop the bleeding, these were a godsend... they are amazing and stop everything short of a major wound - I use nothing else........... buy them - they&#x27;re amazing!!!!</li>
    <li> The product is great. The shipping was a little slow but no big deal.</li>
    <li> Bought them for my 85 year old father who just thinks they are the best. Clean and easy to use.</li>
    <li> So much better than the styptic pencils and no mess.</li>
    <li> came in in a timely manner in great condition. I use this product all the time.. thank you.</li>
    <li> I use these styptic swabs frequently when I shave as a result of taking blood thinners. They really work and are much better and cleaner (sanitary) than using a styptic pencil. No problems with the order....arrived quickly (4 days) with standard shipping and they were in perfect condition. I give them 5 stars and would recommend them to others as well.</li>
    <li> Great addition to shaving gear - individual packets make it very convenient. The Q-tip shaped dispensers are easy to use and are far better than the dry Syptic pencils that have to be activated by water. These Syptic swabs work well and are non-abrasive.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best! Absolutely does the job, dries clear (unlike those old-fashioned sticks), comes in a small case perfect for storage at home or traveling...what&#x27;s not to like?!  Definitely a SMART BUY!</li>
    <li> These individual styptic swabs are very effective, sanitary and convenient.  Much better than the old style styptic pencils which are not only messy but very unsanitary.</li>
    <li> Expensive but quite functional</li>
    <li> Great product.  perfect for my travel shave bag.  Simple to use and no fuss, no mess like the sticks.</li>
    <li> This is an effective way to stop a cut from bleeding. I did  a no no by pulling my nose hair and it kept bleeding. This septic stick deliverd a liquid to the inner part of my nose and it effectivly stopped bleeding. I ordered more and now have them in my travel bag and at home.</li>
