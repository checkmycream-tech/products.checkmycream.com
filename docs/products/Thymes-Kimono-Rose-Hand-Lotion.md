    <li> I like the scent of it - my girlfriend bought this and actually is using it as fragrant lotion. The 8.25oz is a lot for just hand use purpose - so she uses it as body lotion instead to enjoy and share the pleasant floral scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For moisturizing purpose - it&#x27;s a little bit not enough for people has dry skin. Not a good choice to use after shower to hydrating skins, but excellent for creating scent while not want to wear perfume.</li>
    <li> I like the scent but didn&#x27;t realize that the bottle has gotten smaller. This is really too much money for 8 ounces.</li>
    <li> I saw one of my friend having this lotion and I really liked the clean crisp smell it has. The only complaint I have is I dont know of many outlets that I can go try different samples of this brand.

    <li> Great product and prompt service. Love this fragrance as it is lighter than others I have used. Yes smells like roses and lingers as well. Love it.</li>
    <li> My favorite brand. Not sticky or greasy. lovely on the skin.</li>
    <li> Very light, nice fragrance.  Lotion absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> Ordered this specific bottle since it has a hand pump. I got the lotion and the hand pump was broken. I contacted them asking if I could get just a pump sent to me since it didn&#x27;t work. They said no, they would need to send a whole new bottle and I would need to send the old bottle back. Just got the second bottle and that pump is broken also.</li>
    <li> This hand cream is fabulous. It is not greasy after you use it and the fragrance is not over-powering. I have used it for almost a year on my hands and arms.</li>
    <li> This was an additional product to the cologne that I bought and I was told that in order for the cologne to last you should layer it and I do.  I love the smell of it and I get so many compliments from people.</li>
    <li> One of the best hand lotions out there.  This is my fifth bottle and well-worth every penny spent.  Kimono Rose is a rose scent, but it is more complex than that - a hint of spice maybe.  This is a great very feminine lotion - flowery, yet not overpowering.</li>
    <li> The most lovely, feminine scent ever.  I&#x27;ve turned an army of women onto this lotion over the years.</li>
    <li> Kimono Rose is a fresh  and clean fragrance that can be worn any time. The lotion goes on smoothly and leaves the skin silky soft.</li>
    <li> Love Kimono Rose!  It is my favorite of the Thymes products.  Not greasy, absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent &amp; rich lotion.</li>
    <li> I got this to accent the roller perf. of kimono rose. Smells great, very feminine and gentle but powerful enough to smell... And with both combined, it creates an even longer lasting scent :)</li>
