      <li>Now I have back my beautiful nails, in fact I now have to trim them because they grow to long.</li>
      <li>I used to use another quick dry top coat that has been well received but had to look for an alternative because it was &#x27;shrinking&#x27; my Manicure each time I used it.</li>

<li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve bought at least 5 at different places in past years.</li>

    <li> Works really well and dries very fast.</li>
    <li> Fantastic. It actually help my polish from chipping for several days. Will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> Threw out all my other top &amp; base coats when I tried this. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. I used to blame my chipped nail polish on the polish, but it was my old top coat. My polish lasts 2 weeks, would probably last longer, but I get bored with the color and like to change every week or two.</li>
    <li> I usually do my own nails and prior to using Miracote I was lucky to have the polish look good for one full week.  After using Miracote, the polish looks good a week in, without any chipping.  Nail polish dries faster and makes smudges and sheet lines a thing of the past.  For the rare occasions that I go to the nail salon, I take this with me and ask the manicurist to use it--it&#x27;s far better than the top coat they use.  Highly recommend this product, it&#x27;s worth the price and goes a long way!</li>
    <li> It works! You have to be patient and diligent to apply the product as prescribed. Your nails WILL be stronger and grow longer. They are not a substitute for acrylic nails, but they will be strong, long, natural nails.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money. My nails chipped in one day!</li>
    <li> This dry quick product works!!!! I love it.</li>
    <li> Was recommended by my friend, however didn&#x27;t work on my nails. Usually nail polish stays for 5-7 days, but combined with this product lasts for 3 days only.</li>
    <li> Miracote is a fantastic topcoat.  Used in some salons - it&#x27;s that good.  Very durable and quick drying - great to use between maincures to keep your nail finish shiny and protected. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 5 years. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used dozens of products, trying to solve my split nails problem. This one works so well that I can hardly keep my nails as short as I prefer. They just keep growing!</li>
    <li> Love this product, fastest drying top coat ever!</li>
    <li> Miracote makes the best base and top coat. Keeps polish on longer and looks shinier</li>
    <li> Great shine and helps nail polish last longer.</li>
    <li> This is similar to the Duri - Brush N Go. It is very shinny and dries very fast. It does not allow my nail polish to chip for 5 - 6 days even with washing dishes and working around the garden. I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Delivery was fast and the product was packed in a box and bubble wrap. The product does what it says. Dries quick and shiny. Like it much better than seche vite</li>
    <li> Microcote really does dries your nails fast. Within 10-15 minutes of apppling it to my nails, they are pretty much smudge-proof. No more hair print/patterns after 2-3 hours of drying before going to bed as with other products.  I&#x27;m going to recommend this product ot everyone I know.</li>
    <li> I love this product and the rejuvecote by duri. This top coat dries really fast, then every day I put rejuvecote over it and my nail polish last a week or more!</li>
    <li> I thought when I ordered it , it was for nails that were not healthy.  I am disappointed because it has done nothing for my nails.  I&#x27;m now not sure what its used for.</li>
    <li> Not my cup of tea. This product actually peels a lot . Will not order again. Makes my nails dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry just not for me</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I used to use another quick dry top coat that has been well received but had to look for an alternative because it was &#x27;shrinking&#x27; my Manicure each time I used it. This product is very quick drying and it has very little order compared to the other I used to use with began with the letters Sech....  Duri also is very quick drying and the product is rock hard after only a few minutes, so no smudges. Will definitely buy again. This is my new topcoat.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Makes my nails grow so fast and strengthens them too. Especially from winter peeling. I give it as stocking stuffers</li>
    <li> Wife swears by it.  I&#x27;m just a guy who orders what she wants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve bought at least 5 at different places in past years.</li>
    <li> Drys fast, I would buy again!</li>

    <li> Love this. This is my second bottle. My nail salon uses this brand which is why I bought it in the first place. When I do my nail myself it days quickly and my polish lasts all week.  Start with the &amp;#34;Rejuvacote Nail Growth&amp;#34; for you base coat. You will not be sorry. Soon your nails will be great.</li>
    <li> Used the product before so knew what to expect.</li>
    <li> Dries quickly and protects my nails from chipping.</li>
    <li> MY FIRST ORDER, BUT I&#x27;M SURE IT WON&#x27;T BE MY LAST. i WOULD RECOMMEND IT FOR ANYONE WHO HAS HAD PROBLEMS WITH NAILS. i HAVE TOLD MY FRIENDS THEY NEED TO TRY IT!!!!</li>
