    <li> LA Girl Pro Conceal is a great concealer I like the color texture of this product. Will tell others about it.</li>
    <li> Wanted to use this as a cream bronzer but it&#x27;s a bit too dark. Also I feel it doesn&#x27;t spread very well once applied on your face. It&#x27;s better to put it on your hand, mix well then apply to your face. It works though.</li>
    <li> This concealer is just okay, it is good for medium  coverage but not for full coverage, the best is dermablend.</li>
    <li> This product either was damaged or sucks overall first time trying it I think it&#x27;s because it came from amazon anyways when I open it to try it it was so watery water  came out instead of product I was so disappointed not only did it ruin my makeup with the water that squirted out but eveytime I used it it did the same I have to squeeze it really hard to make the product come out and when I do first water comes out then the product so confused not sure if it&#x27;s defective or that&#x27;s how it is bummer !</li>
    <li> Perfect for contouring.</li>
