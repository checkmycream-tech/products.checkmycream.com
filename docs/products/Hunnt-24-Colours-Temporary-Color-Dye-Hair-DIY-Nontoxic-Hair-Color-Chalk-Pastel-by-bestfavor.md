      <li>I love how bright they are and the large variety of colors to choice from.</li>
      <li>and I love it as it can wash out and its  really easy to use</li>

      <li>They have cracked easy but its not like we&#x27;ve lost any use of the product.</li>
      <li>The colors are vibrant and bright.</li>
      <li>For the price it is fine.</li>
      <li>This is really cheap stuff.</li>
      <li>Granddaughters will still enjoy the product.</li>
      <li>This is just cheap drawing chalk, not hair dye as stated.  </li>
      <li>I got it fairly quickly and most of the colors wash out quickly.</li>
      <li>These work really well and wash out very easily.</li>
      <li>Colors differ little bit, there are not so many shades of pastel colors as I wanted, it&#x27;s more bright that I expacted, but I still like it</li>
      <li>But what did come was a pack of pastels worth 80$ cha-ching!</li>
      <li>but looks cool on light colored hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fun &amp; easy to use.</li>
      <li>So much fun and easy to use.</li>
      <li>If your hair is bleached colors show up very bright and it will take a few washes to be removed</li>
      <li>Super easy to use and washes right out.</li>
      <li>and she really does love it.  </li>
      <li>This is a good size kit with lots of different colors.</li>
      <li>My daughter wanted the ones on Tv when I found these with more variety she absolutely loves all the colours</li>
      <li>and it would glide on easily and comes out with first washing.</li>
      <li>Luckily I&#x27;m an artist and can use pastels in my work.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to use, and really lasts.  </li>
      <li>It lasts for about 3-4 days (depending on the color), and looks really pretty!</li>
      <li>Do NOT ever order this item unless you want to just have fun drawing with it.</li>
      <li>Fun for all ages to decorate your hair adding style &amp; personality.  </li>
      <li>Nowhere on the box does it say anything about being able to apply this product to your hair, in fact it says it&#x27;s for professional artists.  </li>
      <li>Fun to use, Shows up easier on lighter hair.  </li>
      <li>The price was right.</li>
      <li>The colors are really bright on blonde hair, and we found it works best on dark hair if you wet the hair a bit first.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love them I use them quite a bit I love using them on a black background.</li>
      <li>If hair is dark you must use extremely bright ones.</li>
      <li>This product is pretty neat</li>
      <li>While I love the colors and the idea, I may as well have used regular chalk on my hair.  </li>
      <li>We would like to send it back but would end up wasting more money.  </li>
      <li>Then we started at the top of her hair by her scalp and put it in there, re-wetting the end of the chalk as necessary.  </li>
      <li>Just with it came with more instructions in or outside of box</li>
      <li>I have never had it last more than a day with the colors I have used.</li>
      <li>(if you are using a flat iron, don&#x27;t go over an area many times as this will just get rid of the chalk).</li>
      <li>but it sure made your hair look dry.  </li>
      <li>These colors are great to change the color of your hair and just put a few strands in a different color.  </li>
      <li>My daughter loves it and thinks it is &amp;#34;So Much Fun!&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>It really helps.</li>
      <li>Whole head.</li>
      <li>the whole thing is just something i would use in art class.</li>
      <li>The package comes and straight up says they are for ART.</li>
      <li>very drying</li>
      <li>The seller promptly answered all of my questions and the shipment came much faster than estimated.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t know if I should apply this to my hair, but I gave it the highest rating, because I can use them</li>
      <li>it fades really fast.</li>
      <li>I have light blonde hair.</li>
      <li>Fun gift for a 10 year old.</li>
      <li>Too much of a hassle to return it</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Fun to use, Shows up easier on lighter hair.  Lighter colors show up ok on darker hair. If your hair is bleached colors show up very bright and it will take a few washes to be removed</li>
    <li> What ever you do, do not order this. i sucks. the whole thing is just something i would use in art class. its like such a waste![[ASIN:B00ANH56BS New Fashion 24 Colours Temporary Color Dye Hair DIY Nontoxic Hair Color Chalk Pastel]]</li>
    <li> We had a hard time getting the chalk onto my daughter&#x27;s hair at first too but then dipped the end of ther chalk into a small glass of water, just the VERY END of the chalk (or it will get mushy).  Then we started at the top of her hair by her scalp and put it in there, re-wetting the end of the chalk as necessary.  It worked great and now all of her friends want the product too!</li>
    <li> Im 66years and having a blast with this its a great product works like It says comes out easy its wonderful. I do have my favorite ones so I kinda wish there were 2 of my favorites.</li>
    <li> i like this even tho it didnt work well for dark hair..&lt;br /&gt;one chalk was broken when i opened it no guidelines on how to use ...</li>
    <li> great colors that are nice and bright my daughter has dark hair and you could still see the colors... she loves it. the best way I found using it was to actually just wet the chalk itself and the strand of hair just a little and it would glide on easily and comes out with first washing.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love them I use them quite a bit I love using them on a black background.</li>
    <li> Do NOT ever order this item unless you want to just have fun drawing with it. It is nothing but a set ofregular drawing pastels. I am very disappointed and would never order anything from this seller.</li>
    <li> Fun gift for a 10 year old. My little cousin is in that hair color phase and I figured this would help her change it up without the damage of color treatments. She now does a different color for every one of her volleyball games.</li>
    <li> I sent this as a gift to someone,so I have never used this item before ,I hope they liked it!</li>
    <li> When your hair is dry it&#x27;s really hard to get it onto your hair, but as soon as you get the strand of hair a little wet it goes on REALLY easily. And it even works pretty well on darker hair, as long as it&#x27;s a little wet when you apply it.</li>
    <li> Works great! It seems to wash out right away on my dark blonde hair. I have never had it last more than a day with the colors I have used.</li>
    <li> These work really well and wash out very easily. They have cracked easy but its not like we&#x27;ve lost any use of the product. Great colors!</li>
    <li> I liked the varieties of color but it sure made your hair look dry.  This was for my daughter and after a couple of uses, she just wasn&#x27;t into it because of the dry look.</li>
    <li> she\he gave me coloring pastels instead of temporary color hair die she did not give me what i ordered :(</li>
    <li> These work so well and stay in throughout the day. Get the chalk wet first (I run it under sink water). If you have darker hair put white in first, and then run the color you want over the white. Before you put the colors in, put your hair up in a ponytail so that your hair is easier to style.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even think it&#x27;s for hair, really hard to put it on my hair... wILL never but it again</li>
    <li> While I love the colors and the idea, I may as well have used regular chalk on my hair.  The color rubs off on everything and is messy!</li>
    <li> These colors are great to change the color of your hair and just put a few strands in a different color.  The price was right.</li>
    <li> Colors differ little bit, there are not so many shades of pastel colors as I wanted, it&#x27;s more bright that I expacted, but I still like it</li>
    <li> How do people get this on their hair? They seem more like pastels you draw with than something to color your hair with. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> When I purchased this product, I wanted to put streaks in my hair occasionally.  When I received them, it looked to me like they were pastels for drawing.  Luckily I&#x27;m an artist and can use pastels in my work.  Nowhere on the box does it say anything about being able to apply this product to your hair, in fact it says it&#x27;s for professional artists.  I really don&#x27;t know if I should apply this to my hair, but I gave it the highest rating, because I can use them and I love the colors.</li>
    <li> It made my hair smell awful! They broke very easily. It took the red and purple about two weeks until it fully was gone. It took a while for the colors to actually show up in my hair.</li>
    <li> Does not work as well as expected, if have very light hair but is thin it makes it look like straw and frayed. If hair is dark you must use extremely bright ones. Also getting them a little wet helps but then hair gets stiff</li>
    <li> THIS IS NOT HAIR CHALK. This is chalk for art projects or drawing on sidewalks. I can&#x27;t believe anyone could get this to transfer to hair. WASTE OF MONEY!!</li>
    <li> it has many colors, my daughter likes it. but..... when she paint hairs after some time all cloth becomes in the paint</li>
    <li> This is really cheap stuff. I&#x27;ve used it twice. It gets all over the shirt you&#x27;re wearing. The colors are dull and it goops up in your hair. Totally grodie. Um, def not &amp;#34;temporary hair dye.&amp;#34; This is more like, &amp;#34;Actually Sidewalk Chalk&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Arrived in a good time. Nice collection of colors. But, they don&#x27;t seem to be very bold, or easily applied. They don&#x27;t stay in your hair for very long. And, I am aware they are temporary colors, but I would at least expect a day of wear. Very disappointed they didn&#x27;t last, and weren&#x27;t bright in the hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted this and I love it as it can wash out and its  really easy to use and she really does love it.  And it was something we both agreed on . If your little girl wants to color her hair crazy like this is perfect cause it comes out when you need it too :)</li>
    <li> more like canvas chalk</li>
    <li> Bought it for my 9 year old cousin. She loved it! Super easy to use and washes right out. Great for the young ones</li>
    <li> The package comes and straight up says they are for ART. Nothing to do with hair. They don&#x27;t even work on your hair. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, it doesn&#x27;t transfer to your hair. Total waste of time and money. Save yourself the aggravation</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awful, the chalk doesn&#x27;t come off and color the hair. This is to be expected when buying products overseas.</li>
    <li> This product I would not recommend, it does nothing but create a big mess and leave your hair feeling gross and unable to brush through.</li>
    <li> Bought  the hair color for my 2 older grands and the 2 younger girls had to have some ....So Stocking Stuff for this Christmas</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loves it.  Kept her busy.</li>
    <li> My daughter bought this for herself.  She was happy to get a bargain!!  She was wanting hair color, but didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton.  She has no complaints!!</li>
    <li> Love. So much fun and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Fun for all ages to decorate your hair adding style &amp; personality.  Washes out easy, make sure you hairspray over the chalk so it doesn&#x27;t rub off.</li>
    <li> Gets all over your fingers but ALWAYS wear gloves</li>
    <li> this doesn&#x27;t work.  it is simply like blackboard chalk. Waste of money.  We would like to send it back but would end up wasting more money.  Just using it to draw on paper.</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted the ones on Tv when I found these with more variety she absolutely loves all the colours and I have no doubt she will try all the colours out.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s messy, it&#x27;s hard to see, the only thing great about it is that it washes out easily. very drying</li>
    <li> its a great product it great for anyone i personaly use it to make my hair to match my outfit.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my niece and she said they are very hard to use and the color doesn&#x27;t stay in very well that you stain your fingers more than your hair I was very disappointed to hear this I figured this was a great way for her to have the funky color hair she wanted without the damage of dying it but it didn&#x27;t work that way</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get this order even through I bought it! But what did come was a pack of pastels worth 80$ cha-ching!</li>
    <li> For the price it is fine. Little less quality than what I was expecting. Granddaughters will still enjoy the product.</li>
    <li> not what was shown! not happy about it at all! could have went to art store and pick it up for $5 and got more for my money.</li>
    <li> It will not work at all. We tried it on light &amp; dark hair even on wet hair. So I had a disappointed little granddaughter at Christmas!</li>
    <li> This is a good size kit with lots of different colors. My daughter loves it and thinks it is &amp;#34;So Much Fun!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I believed it to be chalk hair with this title,&amp;#34;New Fashion 24 Colours Temporary Color Dye Hair DIY Nontoxic Hair Color...&amp;#34;. It is regular pastels not meant for hair. Too much of a hassle to return it so I kept it. Very disappointed however.</li>
    <li> This product will only really show up on blonde hair, not brown or black. It was hard to get it to show up at all.</li>
    <li> ummm arrived on time&lt;br /&gt;some chalk was broke... it fades really fast. but looks cool on light colored hair. I wouldn&#x27;t wear clothes that you don&#x27;t want ruined cause the chalk powered gets all over your clothes</li>
    <li> I ordered this product based on the description and photograph of the product. What I received is not New Fashion Temporary Color Dye for hair. It is a very small (3.5 x 7.5 in) box of 1 inch pastels (not matching the colors from the photograph) that I assume are meant to draw with. However, it is packaged in another language, so who knows. I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I tried using this on a client a few weeks ago and the chalk barely even took to the hair.</li>
    <li> They were a little too stiff for what I was wanting to do. instead of using them to chalk hair, I used them to apply makeup on dolls. Again, a little too stiff for my liking, but one you rubbed through the top- some of them got softer. I gave them a 5 star review because we even tried it on hair and SOME of the colors weren&#x27;t vibrant on dark hair, and others you couldn&#x27;t see at all. We had to use almost all the white just to make the colors show up.</li>
    <li> My daughter has a great time with this color selection.  Changes her color every day!  Easy to wash off.  I haven&#x27;t noticed it drying out the hair like other reviewers.</li>
    <li> This product is billed as Hair dye but is is just ordinary pastels found in any craft store, probably for less money.  I knew such pastels could be used for hair dye but this was purchased as part of a gift for someone who wanted HAIR pastels.  I&#x27;m sure they will work, but they are NOT what was advertised.</li>
    <li> The color would not transfer to our hair.  We tried it dry and wet.  Would like to have my money back.</li>
    <li> This did not work at all.  It seemed like regular chalk. There were no instructions. It was not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Read tips online how to do this. It really helps. I colored my hair dark brown! Whole head. It dried my hair out but i didn&#x27;t use moisturizing conditioner before hand like suggested. I just didn&#x27;t like how messy it was but i think it worked great. I have light blonde hair.</li>
    <li> I was this as hair chalk many and it works great. The sticks are very stiff and feel hard to break. I love how bright they are and the large variety of colors to choice from.</li>
    <li> My kids really enjoyed using the hair chalk over summer vacation. The colors are really bright on blonde hair, and we found it works best on dark hair if you wet the hair a bit first. The seller promptly answered all of my questions and the shipment came much faster than estimated. Overall a fun product and an excellent seller to boot! Will definitely shop with them again.</li>
    <li> Took 3+ weeks to get here, and would not &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; hair. The chalk was too hard to use as even sidewalk chalk</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have a set and I sent a set to my nephew for his birthday.  It is easy to use, and really lasts.  I find it doesn&#x27;t come out until I wash it out and I don&#x27;t do anything to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; the color.  It even works well on dark hair.  Love the flexibility of choosing whatever color I want without having to commit to dying my hair.</li>
    <li> I was thrilled when I picked it out of the mail box! The colors are vibrant and bright. I recommend it for all fashion geeks and people who don&#x27;t wanna permanently color their hair. First you wet the lock of your hair and the pastel it self and rub it on the hair on a downward motion. It does dry your hair and fade away if you brush it or play with it too much.</li>
    <li> My daughter ordered this with her birthday money, and was disappointed to open her package and find a plain box of art pastels. The box stated \\&quot;pastels on the front\\&quot; and all other writing was in a foreign language. Nothing indicated hair chalk anywhere - nor were any instructions included on how to use the pastels as hair chalk. We had to look online to find out how to use them.</li>
    <li> These are small sticks less than an inch and hard to worknwith. Color if you can get it to actually adire to your hair fads within a couple of hours even if you flat iron it and then use hair soray on it. Would not recommend this product will be sending it back and going to Michaels craft store and get a better product for less money.</li>
    <li> Not what I thought I was ordering. These look like regular pastels that you draw with and the sticks are very very small. I have dark brown hair and I tried it and the color won&#x27;t show up at all. Total waste of money and I&#x27;m completely unsatisfied.</li>
    <li> This is just cheap drawing chalk, not hair dye as stated.  I wish I&#x27;d read the reviews.  What a waste of money and now I have no gift for my daughter for her birthday.</li>
    <li> This description is for hair chalk but when I received the box, it was art pastels to be specifically used for paper.  :/</li>
    <li> Had I known that I would be recieving a box of pastels that I used in art class when I was a kid, I would&#x27;ve just ordered those. There is no way of knowing that this is &#x27;hair chalk&#x27;. I got this as a gift for my daughters birthday and I almost feel embarassed giving it to her as she is going to have NO CLUE what this is....</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. It works great with my hair even though its so dark and hard to deal with. I love this because its perfect for me. My new school doesn&#x27;t allow unnatural hair color so now I can have it and still get it out before school. It&#x27;s just perfect!</li>
    <li> This product is pretty neat I got it fairly quickly and most of the colors wash out quickly. However I had one problem, the dark blue took three weeks to wash out of my hair, and I wash my hair daily. But all the other colors work just fine</li>
    <li> There is no option for 0 stars:(&lt;br /&gt;Didnt wven have a lid and they were regular chalk, not for hair.. ----</li>
    <li> I love this hair chalk! It&#x27;s fun &amp; easy to use. I like being able to change colors every time I wash my hair!</li>
    <li> This hair chalk is great! It lasts for about 3-4 days (depending on the color), and looks really pretty! Some of the reviews on this say that the color never went on their hair, but all you have to do is get the section of hair you want to chalk wet/damp and then apply!</li>
    <li> The chalk pieces themselves aren&#x27;t very large but by the time your done with your appliance for the day theres still a lot of chalk left of those colors! I LIKED this product a lot. It works very well, only problems would be that sometimes a little bit of the color will stay after you take a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER it turns out that some people can have an allergic reaction to something in this product. Me, being one of those people. I didn&#x27;t even know I was allergic to anything.. But as I type this my face is a big red balloon that I&#x27;m afraid is gonna stick around for quiiite sometime. KINDA SUCKS. I&#x27;d post a picture because I actually look horrendous but I&#x27;m too lazy.</li>
    <li> Came in plain Box, had to print out directions from site...weird. Just with it came with more instructions in or outside of box</li>
    <li> I love it i change it and use it dayly awesome  I would recommend this to every one dead face i love it</li>
    <li> my daughter loves these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for optimal results: wet hair before applying, then air or blow dry, then use a curling iron to set the color (if you are using a flat iron, don&#x27;t go over an area many times as this will just get rid of the chalk). some hair spray can help keep the color longer.</li>
    <li> need to figure out how to use it. the packaging was a bit too thin for such a fragile order but it looks like its good quality</li>
</ol>
