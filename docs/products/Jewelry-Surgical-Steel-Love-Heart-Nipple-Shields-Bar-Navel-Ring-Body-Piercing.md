<li> but this thing is way too long to look normal in my piercing</li>
<li> The bar was a bit thin,  but a cute accessory.</li>
<li> Heart is crooked and the bottom tip is way to long.</li>
<li> This piece of jewelry was just to big for, I would say any nipple the bars were super long and quite heavy was not satisfied at all waste of 3 dollars</li>
<li> the other comments said they only got one!!</li>
<li> A little too big for my choosing, though.</li>
<li> Maybe just s little to big for me</li>
<li> A little difficult to put on but very pretty.</li>
<li> I only received one, not satisfied</li>
<li> but unfortunately they&#x27;re quite large</li>
<li> The bar is extremely long and it very heavy for a nipple shield.  </li>
<li> I have even enlisted the help of a few other people that can not twist them off either.</li>
<li> So right now this thing is pretty useless to me :(</li>
<li> A little on the heavy side</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never had this sort of trouble before.</li>
<li> Waste of my money, and time.</li>
<li> Way too small for a nipple ring its a 16g...</li>
<li> When I received my package, the nipple rings were two different sizes, which look very weird.</li>
<li> Terrible had my nipples hurting the whole time...</li>
<li> that was uncomfortable so needless to say I can wear the barbells for now -k-</li>
<li> fake fake too fake</li>
<li> The product description didn&#x27;t have a size listed , somebody said 18 gauge, but that is wrong.</li>
<li> very painful and heavy....</li>
<li> but I think that&#x27;s crazy to have to do.</li>
<li> and they pinch really bad :(</li>
<li> so disappointed.</li>
<li> Worst purchase ever!!!</li>
<li> Honestly terrible I bought 2 considering</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I would have gave it 2 stars but the order had to many problems. First of all you have to order 2 because it doesn&#x27;t come as a pair. When I received my package, the nipple rings were two different sizes, which look very weird. Hopefully it was just a misunderstanding and I can get the correct size. I would suggest buying them if you get the same size for both.</li>
    <li> Only received one thought i was playing for a pair.</li>
    <li> So beautiful, prefect fit and got it early.</li>
    <li> Way too small for a nipple ring its a 16g...</li>
    <li> Perfect fit! Nicely made I love them 😊</li>
    <li> The bar is extremely long and it very heavy for a nipple shield.  The product description didn&#x27;t have a size listed , somebody said 18 gauge, but that is wrong. For $1.82 + free shipping I didn&#x27;t lose much, but would not purchase again.  Would not recommend unless you have VERY large nipples.</li>
    <li> Honestly terrible I bought 2 considering it says it only comes with one and they are hideous they are really big the barbell is even longer than a tongue ring and the hearts are out of shape I don&#x27;t like it at all</li>
    <li> I thought id give it a try but this thing is way too long to look normal in my piercing</li>
    <li> I only got one nipple ring I thought it was suppose to be two</li>
    <li> Super big for a nipple ring makes no sense</li>
    <li> The bars are really skinny,but looks just like the picture</li>
    <li> very painful and heavy....</li>
    <li> Ternishing want my money back!!!! Look for something from U.S.A.</li>
    <li> These make my nipples swell up and they pinch really bad :( there not as cute once worn</li>
    <li> I only received one, not satisfied</li>
    <li> Fit Great very cute but only came in a single. Wish I would have known that!</li>
    <li> It did come as a set!! I was leary at first Bc the other comments said they only got one!! But these are huge!!</li>
    <li> I only receive one I have two nipples</li>
    <li> Beautiful jewelry wish it came a little bigger for bigger nipples</li>
    <li> I dont know why it didn&#x27;t occur to me that it would only come with one. I needed two for obvious reasons. So I will have to order another one to have a matching pair. But IDK that I will order another one, simply because I can not for the life of me turn the balls at the end to open and try this on. I have even enlisted the help of a few other people that can not twist them off either. I&#x27;ve never had this sort of trouble before. My next attempt will be will pliers but I think that&#x27;s crazy to have to do. So right now this thing is pretty useless to me :(</li>
    <li> Super cute it&#x27;s only one shield worth waiting for it looks great!</li>
    <li> Order TWO!! I repeat ORDER TWO! It only comes with one so if you have both nipples pierced get two.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really like these. A little difficult to put on but very pretty. A little too big for my choosing, though. It said they would arrive on July 1st but I just got them yesterday. VERY happy about that. Very pretty and my husband thinks they&#x27;re cute :) I would def recommend these</li>
    <li> I put them in, and not even a hour later my piercing was infected. Had to take them out. Waste of my money, and time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really cute my nipple was just to big</li>
    <li> Super cute. Maybe just s little to big for me tho?</li>
    <li> I love the piercing but you need to read the details all the way, I only received one nipple ring thinking I was gonna get two. So I just ordered another one</li>
    <li> These are too cute, will buy again..shipped frm out the country but came quicker then expected..thank.you</li>
    <li> The bar was a bit thin,  but a cute accessory.</li>
    <li> I love these and the fit perfectly</li>
    <li> Extremely cute cuff. Fit perfect! (:</li>
    <li> This piece of jewelry was just to big for, I would say any nipple the bars were super long and quite heavy was not satisfied at all waste of 3 dollars haha but it&#x27;s all good</li>
    <li> Bar is WAY TOO THICK!&lt;br /&gt;No way possible to fit it in</li>
    <li> A little on the heavy side</li>
    <li> Only 1, I thought it was a set</li>
    <li> Terrible had my nipples hurting the whole time...fake fake too fake</li>
    <li> Only got one ring instead of the pair</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re gorgeous and fit perfectly for me but unfortunately they&#x27;re quite large and I got them caught on everything</li>

    <li> Worst purchase ever!!! Heart is crooked and the bottom tip is way to long. I would never wear this. Sadly not even worth the one dollar and change I paid. It is worth nothing!!!! Never buying from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Beautiful design however i have large nipples n they didn&#x27;t fit me w/o me squishing my nipple n them n that was uncomfortable so needless to say I can wear the barbells for now -k-</li>
    <li> The size was not as it appears</li>
    <li> This was cheap and didn&#x27;t last</li>
    <li> Exactly what they look like.</li>
    <li> Originally bought it for my ear don&#x27;t have a nipple pierced but that thing is huge I bought 3 of em so disappointed. Why am I supposed to do with it now?. On the bright side it was here before estimated date but very unsatisfied</li>
    <li> I&#x60;ve gotten her several sets of nipple jewelry . These are her favorites</li>
