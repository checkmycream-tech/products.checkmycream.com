      <li>WHAT YOU MIX THIS WITH AND MAKE SURE</li>
      <li>I was super pleased!</li>
      <li>Both his nightstand tables had 1 drawer in them each filled to the brim with even more drugs from doctors.  </li>
      <li>No smell and easy to work with.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s so much cheaper and possibly more effective than store bought.</li>
      <li>Also, I didn&#x27;t notice any strong sulfur smell with the sublimed sulfur.</li>
      <li>I used this in conjunction with Jamaican black castor oil for rapid hair growth and both happen to be the best products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>After reading the reviews I figured it would be smart to make my own sulfur product for my face.</li>
      <li>If your looking to get pure looking skin and a healthy glow, this product is most defiantly for you.  </li>
      <li>AVAILABLE   </li>
      <li>I have been using since Nov 2010, my hair has really grown (almost 4 in) in my problems areas that were honestly bald.</li>
      <li>I am a 44 year old woman with red/blonde hair and fair skin.</li>
      <li>But I wondered what I would do to my HAIR because I have lots of dandruff and the cheap Suave shampoo I use doesn&#x27;t clean my hair</li>
      <li>I think I will be able to provide more concrete feedback at that time.</li>
      <li>I would order again from this seller, it was super fast shipping, and the price was the BEST that I found on the net.</li>
      <li>Make a powerful sulfur growth aide without the stench of MTG Amen!</li>
      <li>When I came to clean up the place to sell it...</li>
      <li>It was really cheap and also came really quickly.</li>
      <li>Many thanks to the Seller.</li>
      <li>You get about a coffee cup full of sulfure.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery.</li>
      <li>/&gt;i am satisfied with it so far!!</li>
      <li>Based on information I received from various hair forums, it is believed that the sublimed sulphur powder is an effective hair growth aid.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth a try.</li>
      <li>Mixing is so much fun.</li>
      <li>Luckily, I have more than enough sulfur for what i am trying to use it for</li>
      <li>Then I rinse it off with warm water and pat dry.</li>
      <li>Very fast delivery</li>
      <li>lost 10 lbs in the first 2 week.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using it to fertilize hot pepper plants, and it seems to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is the first time I am using this product.</li>
      <li>Somewhat messy, but you don&#x27;t need to use much to make good use of, so it lasts quite a while and is well worth the price.</li>
      <li>So because I wasn&#x27;t consistent</li>
      <li>You can also add 1 part sulfur to 3 parts of your favorite facial wash or cream.</li>
      <li>You know exactly what&#x27;s in your products</li>
      <li>If using for acne, it is not recommended to use anything higher than 10% sulfur.</li>
      <li>So far, I haven&#x27;t seen any extraordinary growth.</li>
      <li>I am hoping that the sulphur oil mixture that I made and have been using for almost two weeks straight will help to speed up the growth.  </li>
      <li>I apply this mixture to my whole face as a mask and leave on for 10 minutes to 60 minutes, depending on the condition of my skin.</li>
      <li>If you use too much of it, it will shred your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I really dont know how well it worked for me.</li>
      <li>LHCF ladies should find this very beneficial.</li>
      <li>I SAW HER AGAIN ABOUT 2-3 MONTHS Later and acne free.</li>
      <li>but I will certainly purchase from this vendor again if I need more sulfur, or any other medicinal grade product for that matter.</li>
      <li>Another use is anchoring any metallic object in stone or concrete!</li>
      <li>Love this product, it doesn&#x27;t stink like other sulfur powders, i will continue to use this brand.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used product yet but excited to and bottle appears to be bigger than 4 oz !!</li>
      <li>This product clearly states NOT to apply it directly to the skin and to full well with water to remove any trace.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy to report I&#x27;m at 1/2 inch of growth in two weeks - double my usual growth.</li>
      <li>a serious note, the item was as described, good value for money and arrived on time.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Pretty nice size bottle, considering the fact that a little \\&quot;should\\&quot; go a long way.</li>
      <li>Now at the time I was also using a new cleanser</li>
      <li>I refuse to live like that.</li>
      <li>There are many more uses for it and its specific directions are not available since it is recommended for technical use only.  </li>
      <li>The redness is starting to go away, the bumps and flaking are starting to smooth out, and the itching is subsiding.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I ordered this sulfur on 08/12/10 today is 09/13/10 and I still do not have what I paid for. Buyer be aware!!!!</li>
    <li> I was determined to make my own sulfur products. I have acne-prone skin and seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the scalp and face and sulfur works well for me for both conditions. Sulfur is oil soluble (only mixes with oil). So far I&#x27;ve made a 10% sulfur scalp ointment (mixed 1 tsp sulfur with 9 tsp avocado oil). I love it. SD symptoms are all gone. I just mix about 1 tsp of this mix with my shampoo (or apply directly to my scalp and leave on for about an hour before shampooing). This works better than any prescription or OTC medicine I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;  For my face mix (also 10% sulfur), I mix the sulfur in my whipped shea butter mix that I use for my face. A little bit goes a long way. No more cystic acne.  I use less than a pea sized amount for face and neck and I stay moisturized all day long.&lt;br /&gt;  I also added some sulfur, activated charcoal and white willow bark extract (natural salicylic acid) to some melt and pour soap for my son for face and body acne. So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;  Don&#x27;t be intimidated about making your own products. Mixing is so much fun. You know exactly what&#x27;s in your products and it&#x27;s so much cheaper and possibly more effective than store bought. I&#x27;m very happy I create my own mixes that work. Also, I didn&#x27;t notice any strong sulfur smell with the sublimed sulfur. You can always add an essential oil like orange, lemon, eucalyptus, etc to help if the smell bothers you. Definitely worth a try. I highly recommend. Hope my review helps someone.  :)</li>
    <li> Love this product, it doesn&#x27;t stink like other sulfur powders, i will continue to use this brand. I mix it with oils for my hair, i&#x27;ve made a face cream by mixing this with aloe vera gel and it&#x27;s worked wonders for my acne. I use this in conjunction with Derma-Klear Akne treatment soap.</li>
    <li> I purchased this sulfur to add to a hair-growth mix I use and it works wonders.    Definitely recommend it and I have been using it for a few months now.</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery I love that ! I hope that one bad review is eventually removed ! I haven&#x27;t used product yet but excited to and bottle appears to be bigger than 4 oz !! Hair lovers buy buy buy</li>
    <li> I mix this sulphur with oils and oil my scalp every three days and it softens my hair immediately. Its cheap and effective and I am buying more once i&#x27;m finished with what I already have.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product on 2/11/11 and I received the product on 2/15/11/.  I am very pleased with the product and the delivery time.</li>
    <li> The way that I use it is mix castor oil, sulfur, and some rosemary oil to make a sulfur mix. I apply it to my scalp one to two days before I wash. It helps with the itchiness after I wash. It still smells no matter how much essential oils I put to it.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not much more I can say that everyone else hasn&#x27;t said already.  I just mixed it with some some generic face cream I already had and dabbed it on a weird zit bump that didn&#x27;t surface. Within 5 minutes I could barely feel it!  Yay---that means I can go back to taking Phentermine to lose weight again. I had to stop because my folliculitis flared up and dermatologists were useless.  I&#x27;m so sick of taking antibiotics that don&#x27;t help. I&#x27;m so sick of pills from doctors. They scare me. My father passed away at his kitchen table, living alone.  When I came to clean up the place to sell it...OMG! I couldn&#x27;t believe he had hundreds of varying prescriptions the doctors had been giving him. His kitchen table was covered with prescription pills in containers. Both his nightstand tables had 1 drawer in them each filled to the brim with even more drugs from doctors.  I refuse to live like that.</li>
    <li> I mixed this with evoo and apply to my scalp and massage for 3mins twice a week. EVERYONE keeps asking, \\&quot;what are you using in your hair that is making it grow so fast?\\&quot; Its not growing faster, im retaining and obtaining the maximum amount of growth i can get per month. IF YOU USE FOR YOUR HAIR, DO NOT APPLY TO HAIR ONLY SCALP!&lt;br /&gt;BE CAREFUL HOW YOU MIX IT FOR HAIR BECAUSE YOU WILL DEF GET A MIGRAINE IF YOU DON&#x27;T ADD ENOUGH OIL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SKIN: I use this on my panti line for blemishes or ingrown hairs, works like a charm (only takes a few hours)&lt;br /&gt;My niece had horrible acne and I gave her the same mix i used for my scalp for her face. I SAW HER AGAIN ABOUT 2-3 MONTHS Later and acne free. SHE LOVES, AND ORDERED MORE ON HER OWN!</li>
    <li> I love what this stuff does for my hair. The growth is wonderful. I mix it with apricot oil and extra virgin olive oil. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I am using this product. I mix it with my shampoo and conditionner. I put a little also in my oil mix for my hair. a little does really go a long way. If you use too much of it, it will shred your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for a month now and my hair is stronger than it was before. I will keep using it. and since I only put a little in my hair products, I guess the bottle will last me a long long time!&lt;br /&gt;bottom line, this product works and&lt;br /&gt;i am satisfied with it so far!!</li>
    <li> It looks like sulfur, it smells like sulfur, so i guess it is. I&#x27;m using it to fertilize hot pepper plants, and it seems to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given that it can be hazardous, i&#x27;d like it marginally better if it came in a bottle with a child-proof top.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I use it to mix treatment for acne for myself. It works great. I recommend it, it&#x27;s a very good price for this amount.</li>
    <li> I have had severely oily skin, painful cystic acne as well as white-heads for most of my life and nothing ever helped me except sulfur treatments. Since I have no insurance at the moment and can&#x27;t see a skin doctor, I have opted to make my own treatments....and it&#x27;s turning out great!  I mix 1 part powdered sulfur with 3 parts mix of: aloe vera gel or lanolin, one drop of vitamins A &amp; E oil. I apply this mixture to my whole face as a mask and leave on for 10 minutes to 60 minutes, depending on the condition of my skin. Then I rinse it off with warm water and pat dry. It is a miracle and I could just cry!  My skin is free of redness and I have no more cystic acne.  You can also add 1 part sulfur to 3 parts of your favorite facial wash or cream. I advise using the cream as a spot treatment or mask though.  EDIT: I have discovered that you shouldn&#x27;t use this every day or your skin will become immune to it and the effects won&#x27;t be as noticeable. Just use the mask when your skin is particularly oily or broken out. Also, Sulfur doesn&#x27;t work for everyone.  BE VERY CAREFUL AROUND YOUR EYES PLEASE!</li>
    <li> I ordered the Sublimed Sulfur to use in my hair oil mixture. Sulfur is used for hair growth and this sublimed sulfur is medicinal grade and has a faster absorption rate. I am satisfied with my purchase. I have also heard of using sulfur as a treatment for acne and skin and I may experiment with that use. The smelly odor commonly associated with sulfur was instead replaced by the slightest hint of a lemony smell.    Luckily, I have more than enough sulfur for what i am trying to use it for but I will certainly purchase from this vendor again if I need more sulfur, or any other medicinal grade product for that matter.</li>
    <li> DUDE, i&#x27;m not guna lie i have had horrible acne all through out my high school career.  so this summer i was determined to get the skin i dreamed of before the senior.  I tried multiple things such as face masks and alcohol wipes... But then i came across this product and said to myself what&#x27;s there to loose.  I tried it and literally, over night i could see drastic changes in the mirror.. If your looking to get pure looking skin and a healthy glow, this product is most defiantly for you.  The only thing you have to do is mix it with lotion and use every other day.</li>
    <li> I am an African American lady who bought this product for use in a homemade hair oil mixture. Based on information I received from various hair forums, it is believed that the sublimed sulphur powder is an effective hair growth aid. Since I am currently transitioning my hair from relaxed to natural I was looking for something that would help to speed up the growth so I could cut off all of my permed ends. I have been hesitant to do a big chop, and I am 13 months post. Unfortunately managing two different textures has been a little challenging and even though I haven&#x27;t big chopped, I&#x27;ve lost a lot of the relaxed ends from breakage. I am hoping that the sulphur oil mixture that I made and have been using for almost two weeks straight will help to speed up the growth.  Unfortunately it&#x27;s only been a few weeks so it&#x27;s hard to tell if I&#x27;m getting the desired results. I will try to remember to check back in about two months to report my findings at that time.  I think I will be able to provide more concrete feedback at that time.</li>
    <li> Chiggers hate sulfur.  If you are going into the southern Missouri woods, spread this around your ankles, legs and underwear.  Other commercial products are junk.  Those other products may repel mosquitos, but if you&#x27;ve ever been eaten alive by chiggers, this is the old school remedy.</li>
    <li> This odorless yellow sulfur powder is awesome. I purchased this product to add to my hair oils mixed with essential oils to make some sorta hair growth tonic (laughing). To my surprise I was blown away/ shocked by the results of using my homemade hair growth tonic. I think that this sulfur powder has sped up my hair growth rate by at least 50 %. I will purchase again! This powder can also be used in acne cream mixtures as well. CAUTION: BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU MIX THIS WITH AND MAKE SURE THAT IT&#x27;S SAFE TO DO SO. Pretty nice size bottle, considering the fact that a little \\&quot;should\\&quot; go a long way. LHCF ladies should find this very beneficial. Make a powerful sulfur growth aide without the stench of MTG Amen!</li>
    <li> I heard other ladies talking about this product for hair growth and thought I would give it a try. I see some growth and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I used this on my hair but haven&#x27;t noticed a extra growth spurt in hair growing rate. So I only use it sporactically when I have time so I can use it up. I probably won&#x27;t repurchase this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried Acnefree Sulfur mask and it worked for me and reduced my acne. However it ran out - it is a 1.7 oz tube with a sulfur concentration of 3.5%. So I was looking for sulfur products that might work for me, and came across this. After reading the reviews I figured it would be smart to make my own sulfur product for my face. I first mixed it with a natural serum I had but I got a rash and these tiny bumps all over my face. Now at the time I was also using a new cleanser so I didn&#x27;t know if it was the sulfur or the cleanser so I stopped both. My face recovered and I decided to try the sulfur again with my Aubrey Organic moisturizer and make a salve over my acne at night. However once again I got this minirash on my forehead and left cheek. So I stopped usuing it again and will NEVER use it on my face again.     But I wondered what I would do to my HAIR because I have lots of dandruff and the cheap Suave shampoo I use doesn&#x27;t clean my hair - there is A LOT of dandruff after I finish washing and drying. I put a little sulfur and topped it off with grape seed oil, mixed it up and massaged the mixture into my scalp. After about 10 minutes I washed it off with Selsun blue shampoo and my hair wasn&#x27;t dry, but moisturized and had absolutely NO DANDRUFF!! I was super pleased! I have a lot of this sulfur and now it won&#x27;t go to waste!</li>
    <li> As I was born 100 years too late , I am forced to learn the technologies of yester year! Sublimed sulphur was a necessity in yesteryears household supplies!  Sulphur is an ingredient in a very effective antibiotic ointment by adding it to petroleum jelly! By burning a small Amt. of the sulphur in a closed environment with fresh fruit leathers before drying them, enhances the color &amp; taste of the dried fruit! In learning the methods of fire making in the early years,molten sulphur was used in making sulphur matches (Spunks). Also a small amt. of sublimed sulphur is a useful additive to potting soil to lower the PH for acid loving plants! Another use is anchoring any metallic object in stone or concrete! Rather than a trip to the hardware store, just melt enough sulphur to fill the void around the object, &amp; you have a permanant fix!!  The list goes on &amp; on!!</li>
    <li> Like a lot of women, I want my hair to grow faster and healthier. I watched a few YouTube videos about women adding sulphur powder to hair oil in order to make their hair grow an inch a month. Of course I had to try. I&#x27;m happy to report I&#x27;m at 1/2 inch of growth in two weeks - double my usual growth.</li>
    <li> Used to mix with JBCO and received results. I&#x27;ve stopped using because of time restricition. Only mix what you plan on using, not great for big batches. As the smell with become rotten overtime. May mix a small batch again with Home Health castor oil as Jamaican Black castor oil is to expensive and shipping prices are outrageous.</li>
    <li> This product was not described as what arrived.  I thought I was purchasing \\&quot;Flowers of Sulfur\\&quot;, but actually received a pharmaceutical product to be used in conjunction with other substances.  My purpose was for applying to the skin to prevent bites form and to kill chiggers.  This product clearly states NOT to apply it directly to the skin and to full well with water to remove any trace.  I would like my money back for the misrepresentation of this product.  Thank you for any help that you can give to me concerning this refund.</li>
    <li> i keep wondering where all these hair growth claims come from. i tried all things including this. no result.&lt;br /&gt;it may be useful in other areas but surely not for hair growth</li>
    <li> I used it on my roses to kill black spot. It seems to be working. The label doesn&#x27;t tell its purity. You may want to put it in an old salt shaker if you are going to use it the way I did. You get about a coffee cup full of sulfure. If you have only a few rose bushes you only need one bottle.</li>
    <li> I added this to my pre- hair wash oil.Sulfur has been a known hair add-on for black hair care.No smell and easy to work with.</li>
    <li> I am a 44 year old woman with red/blonde hair and fair skin. I have had rosacea for years, and have had numerous medications prescribed for this condition including Renova, Metrogel, topical steroids, and the like -all of which either didn&#x27;t work, aggrivated the condition, or only temporarily improved the situation. I received this product and started mixing it in my facial lotion, it immediately started to show improvement. The redness is starting to go away, the bumps and flaking are starting to smooth out, and the itching is subsiding. I&#x27;m hoping the few cystic pimples will fade now, they seem to be flattening out. The price is right to give it a try certainly, and it can be used for other things as well such as gardening and bug repellent.</li>
    <li> The price was great too. My daughter and I have been adding it to our hair oils. It works wonders for growing black hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a B/F and heard great reviews on sulfur and hair growth. I have been using since Nov 2010, my hair has really grown (almost 4 in) in my problems areas that were honestly bald. I have mixed this with the majority of my hair oils (mixes overall), it dissolves well, and I can add what I want, when I want. I will continue to use in my hair regimen. I would order again from this seller, it was super fast shipping, and the price was the BEST that I found on the net.</li>
    <li> I am not certain what I need to write - sulfur is an element with atomic weight of about 32 g/mole, it belongs in the same group with oxygen and is normally yellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a serious note, the item was as described, good value for money and arrived on time. Many thanks to the Seller.</li>
    <li> I love it!  It doesn&#x27;t stink or smell great either.  It actually have a neutral scent to it.  I bought to use in a concoction to try to regrow the edges of my hair and it is working.</li>
    <li> I mix this powder with organic facial oils that I apply before bed to treat rosacea and acne. It smells like sulfur (rotten eggs) and it yellowish and a bit gritty, but works wonders. I have tried dozens of over-the-counter and prescription acne medications and this stuff is priced well and effective, both for acne and rosacea.</li>
    <li> There are many more uses for it and its specific directions are not available since it is recommended for technical use only.  Sublimed sulfur or Flowers of Sulfur is a sulfur powder that&#x27;s popular in herbal remedies. Used in prescription compounding when preparing sulfur ointment and in the treatment of various skin disorders. If using for acne, it is not recommended to use anything higher than 10% sulfur. Directions: For sulfur ointment, mix the sublimed sulfur with any cold cream at the desired strength. Usually a maximum of 10% sublimed sulfur is recommended by simply mixing it with 90% cold cream. This sublimed sulfur is ideal if you need something stronger and cannot find it. ITS   SPECIFIC   DIRECTIONS   ARE   NOT   AVAILABLE   SINCE   IT   IS   RECOMMENDED   FOR   TECHNICAL   USE   ONLY.</li>
    <li> I used this sulfur in a mix of oils to grow my hair out. It did exactly what I expected it to do I grew a 1 inch in a month. I will be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to make an at home hair growth oil. I added it to some different oils...added essential oils and I&#x27;m very pleased. The smell isn&#x27;t TOO bad. I just co-wash more often. It was really cheap and also came really quickly. I&#x27;d order from this vendor again :)</li>
    <li> It work great .i am so please with it .I lost 10 lbs in the first 2 week.I am please with it</li>
    <li> I purchased this product, and have used it in  a &amp;#34;hair growth mixture. So far, I haven&#x27;t seen any extraordinary growth.</li>
    <li> Worked great to get rid of scabies, dog had scabies and needed to get&#x27;em gone. This worked great, forgot about INSECTRIN from the farm store. Used this and got tired of waiting on it to work so I went to FARM AND HOME store and got Insectrin, It contains 10% permethrin which will get ride of scabies in one treatment.</li>
    <li> It is everything I expected. Love it because it has no odor. It blends well with the other oils I use for my hair. The area I use it on now has hair. YEAH!!</li>
    <li> Good product. Quick delivery. Very subtle sulfur smell. Somewhat messy, but you don&#x27;t need to use much to make good use of, so it lasts quite a while and is well worth the price. I used this in conjunction with Jamaican black castor oil for rapid hair growth and both happen to be the best products I&#x27;ve tried. I definitely recommend this method!</li>
    <li> We haven&#x27;t had any problems with mites or larvea in the purple martin nests since it was added under the nests after the babies were born.  Used it every year since I found it, works great.  Teaspoon full every few months between April and July.</li>
    <li> This stuff grows your hair fast , but a little stinky it grow my hair 3 inch in 4 weeks mix with castro oil</li>
    <li> Im actually rating this 3 3/4 stars. I bought this to use it as a growth aid for my hair. I used it mixed with oils. It does dry your hair out a little and once my new growth started coming in I couldn&#x27;t massage it into my hair without getting tangles and a little breakage. So because I wasn&#x27;t consistent I really dont know how well it worked for me. It did cause a little itching after a few uses which I took as a sign of growth but other than that I can&#x27;t say. I will see if there are any other uses for this and see how it works.</li>
    <li> Loved this and made alot of concotions with this.  Helped alot and would recommend this to someone.  Excellent for ones with setbacks in their haircare journey.</li>
    <li> I received a different item than what is shown on the picture and the product should be priced a lot cheaper...</li>
