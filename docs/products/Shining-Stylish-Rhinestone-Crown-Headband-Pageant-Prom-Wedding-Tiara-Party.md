      <li>other then that awesome what u see here is exactly what you will get</li>
      <li>My 5 year old neice really enjoyed!</li>
      <li>Was a very nice product and great price, BUT took quite a time to get here (came after the birthday I needed it for) and could have gotten broken easily for was not in it&#x27;s own box but loose in plastic and not packing plastic either.  </li>
      <li>SUPER SPARKLY.</li>
      <li>why have something so beautiful be destroyed in the deliver process so as you can tell mine got a little bent do to the lack of boxing.</li>
      <li>this is a very pretty ladies crown.  </li>
      <li>the stone cluster at the very top of the tiara is crooked.  </li>
      <li>Pretty it fit a 3 year old and adults</li>
      <li>This looked really pretty on my friend for her birthday....</li>
      <li>I was able to bend it back into shape.  </li>
      <li>The crown itself was made pretty good being metal and not cheap plastic, but when I got it it was in a squishy envelope type package lined with bubble wrap</li>
      <li>This is my first purchase of a tiara</li>
      <li>Presentation was not that good and could have been broken easily.  </li>
      <li>It is very pretty, so far very durable, and she absolutely loves the crown.</li>
      <li>She&#x27;s 5 and into the whole princess</li>
      <li>But once again as in another review the way it is shipped leaves much room for improvement if they need to up the price to change the packaging they should</li>
      <li>She wore it for 2 days straight.</li>
      <li>And while it was pretty enough, and she really liked it, several of the rhinestones fell out immediately with normal use.</li>
      <li>This Crown headband looks so real,  </li>
      <li>very well made, not like the others I have bought.</li>
      <li>I wanted it for a &#x27;princess party&#x27;, and I really thought it was well made for the price.</li>
      <li>The quality was better than expected!</li>
      <li>so I cannot say if this was better than any previous ones I have purchased.  </li>
      <li>Most tiaras are way more expensive than this and who wears one to work, eh?.</li>
      <li>The \\&quot;diamonds\\&quot; sparkled and the tiara itself looked to be of high quality.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a princess or queen look.</li>
      <li>The circumference of the band is a little too large to fit well on a child.</li>
      <li>Again, this is the first tiara I bought (it was for a prop, not for actual prom/wedding)</li>
      <li>I could totally see someone wearing this for a wedding its just that pretty.</li>
      <li>It was the same or cheaper than some real cheezy or plastic ones I saw.</li>
      <li>My 6 year old wanted the crown for her birthday princess party.</li>
      <li>Was pleasantly surprised with look of this piece</li>
      <li>I ordered this for a co-worker of mine (adult) who recently achieved a promotion and we jokingly call her &#x27;Queen&#x27; of her new department.  </li>
      <li>When I first opened my package (the tiara wasn&#x27;t bent at all, unlike other reviewers&#x27;), I was surprised at the sturdiness and beauty of it.</li>
      <li>Much nicer than I expected.  </li>
      <li>The tiara isn&#x27;t missing any stones but there are large gaps in between stones in several places and</li>

    <li> Pretty it fit a 3 year old and adults I love the crown it looks just like the photo she will use this on a cruise</li>
    <li> This was perfect for my Prom as I wanted to look like a princess. The quality was better than expected!</li>
    <li> This Crown headband looks so real,  i DIDN&#x27;T THINK MY FRIEND WAS GOING TO LIKE IT AND SHE TOLD ME IT FIT PERFECT FOR WHAT SHE NEEDED IT FOR.</li>
    <li> I purchased this or a photo of one of my employees to go on the bulletin board.  It looked really nice in the photo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be great for a prices birthday party.</li>
    <li> My 5 year old neice really enjoyed! Looks like it will last for quite a while- very well made, not like the others I have bought.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly well made for its price, I bought 4 of them as gag gifts but the rhinestones were quite dazzling out of the package and construction was quite sturdy.</li>
    <li> Much nicer than I expected.  Inexpensive but great for a costume or a dance.  I wanted it for a &#x27;princess party&#x27;, and I really thought it was well made for the price.</li>
    <li> My 6 year old wanted the crown for her birthday princess party. It is very pretty, so far very durable, and she absolutely loves the crown. Good buy.</li>
    <li> The crown itself was made pretty good being metal and not cheap plastic, but when I got it it was in a squishy envelope type package lined with bubble wrap and my crown had been bent up and a bunch of the jewels had fallen out so that was a bummer since it was a gift.</li>
    <li> My daughter was so excited to get her princess crown for her party she is still wearing it. Good quality reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a the finishing touch for my two tiered birthday cake and it was perfect! The rhinestones are beautiful and it doesn&#x27;t look like a toy for a child to play dress up. I could totally see someone wearing this for a wedding its just that pretty.</li>
    <li> This tiara arrived on time but came to me bent in a couple places (they shipped in an envelope).  I was able to bend it back into shape.  The tiara is perfect for my use (Halloween costume) but had I ordered it for my wedding it would absolutely be going back.  The tiara isn&#x27;t missing any stones but there are large gaps in between stones in several places and the stone cluster at the very top of the tiara is crooked.  I  Would never pay more than $15 for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are just looking for a tiara for costume, stage or dress up purposes this will fit the bill.  It&#x27;s great.  But it is not elegant enough for a bride... Which I&#x27;m sure many brides come looking.</li>
    <li> What a great price,  very nicely made just the right  finishing touch so nice to be able to get every thing we need on one site.</li>
    <li> The tiara is beautiful, only thing is it does not come with combs.  I ended buying hair combs that I glued and sewed to the tiara.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for a co-worker of mine (adult) who recently achieved a promotion and we jokingly call her &#x27;Queen&#x27; of her new department.  She said it was well made, and sent us a picture of herself wearing it.  Said it was much better than the ones her kids used to play with.</li>
    <li> I got this &amp;#34;real princess crown&amp;#34; for my daughter to put in her Christmas stocking. And while it was pretty enough, and she really liked it, several of the rhinestones fell out immediately with normal use. Also, the top triangle-shaped piece bends very easily. In less than a week, my daughter accidentally stepped on it (not hard, because I saw her), and the thing snapped into 3 pieces. Next time, i would def buy something different.</li>
    <li> Bought it for a joke and it was a hit. Most tiaras are way more expensive than this and who wears one to work, eh?.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a princess or queen look. It&#x27;s not very tall, but subtle and sparkles well. I used it for a queen&#x27;s crown at a prom themed event for adults.</li>
    <li> Very economical price and really nice price and quite lovely for a young, beautiful little princess.  Was pleasantly surprised with look of this piece</li>
    <li> A cute trinket for a one time occasion. Was shipped in a bubble envelope and was slightly bent with 2 or 3 stones knocked out. Had I paid more for it I would have been upset.</li>
    <li> PERFECT FOR OUR BIRTHDAY PARTY FOR FRIEND WHO WAS TURNING 50 EVERYONE WAS A PRINCESS, SHE WAS THE QUEEN..RECOMMEND GREAT BUY</li>
    <li> ok this is for my wedding, my theme is fairytale. the tiara is exactly like the picture beautiful! But once again as in another review the way it is shipped leaves much room for improvement if they need to up the price to change the packaging they should why have something so beautiful be destroyed in the deliver process so as you can tell mine got a little bent do to the lack of boxing. it is shipped in a regular bubble envelope period!! if you get your safe great because your mail man is careful with the mail other then that awesome what u see here is exactly what you will get</li>
    <li> This looked really pretty on my friend for her birthday....She is 22, and L-O-V-E-D it! It was perfect size for her hair-do. I would buy it again for a quincenera or a sweet 16 or something!</li>
    <li> Just as the pic shows....SUPER SPARKLY. My daughter loved it! I would recommend this to anyone thinking of buying it.</li>
    <li> Can you imagine the look on my niece&#x27;s face when she opened this at Christmas? She had a &amp;#34;Queen Crown&amp;#34; on her list. I saw this! It was the same or cheaper than some real cheezy or plastic ones I saw. She was thrilled with the &amp;#34;REAL DIAMONDS&amp;#34; (rhinestones) She wore it for 2 days straight. She sparkled wherever she went.</li>
    <li> I bought this tiara to wear to a tea party I was invited to. It was the most elegant option I could find at an affordable price. When I first opened my package (the tiara wasn&#x27;t bent at all, unlike other reviewers&#x27;), I was surprised at the sturdiness and beauty of it. The \\&quot;diamonds\\&quot; sparkled and the tiara itself looked to be of high quality. I&#x27;d recommend this in a heartbeat to anyone looking for an elegant tiara to wear to a party, a dance, or as a wedding accessory. I posted a few pictures as well.&lt;br /&gt;As an added note, this tiara is meant to be worn by adults. The circumference of the band is a little too large to fit well on a child.</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter she loves it. It&#x27;s very pretty quality very good would buy it again no problem. She&#x27;s 5 and into the whole princess and this was great for her it&#x27;s metal not cheap plastic. So it&#x27;s durable.</li>
    <li> for an inexpensive tiara, this one was beautiful. It was, and still is, shiny and bling bling.  Buy one you need it!</li>
    <li> this is a very pretty ladies crown.  i got it for my dining room which i have named the crown room.  also purchased the kings crown and the scepter.  thanks for good prices.</li>
    <li> Was a very nice product and great price, BUT took quite a time to get here (came after the birthday I needed it for) and could have gotten broken easily for was not in it&#x27;s own box but loose in plastic and not packing plastic either.  Should have been wrapped or in a nice box.  Presentation was not that good and could have been broken easily.  Very beautiful and nice, but be careful.</li>
    <li> Its a beautiful head peice. It matches perfectly with my wedding dress!!!! A princess I will be on my wedding day!!!! I might add for such a beautiful headpeice the price was the greatest!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is my first purchase of a tiara so I cannot say if this was better than any previous ones I have purchased.  I can say, however, that this was better than I thought.  I was expecting some kind of kids&#x27; toy with this one - that wasn&#x27;t the case.  The &amp;#34;jewels&amp;#34; looked real enough and were shiny.  The frame itself was shiny was well.  Again, this is the first tiara I bought (it was for a prop, not for actual prom/wedding) and I admit that it was a lot better than I thought.</li>
    <li> I bought two and they look expensive. One for a gift, and one for me. Someone asked me if they were expensive.</li>
