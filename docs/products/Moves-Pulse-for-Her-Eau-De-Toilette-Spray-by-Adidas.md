    <li> smells very good. it looks and feels very modern, i got it for my niece and she likes it a lot.!</li>
    <li> delighted with the fragrance and the value, can recommend widely is very fresh really like me, I hope to buy again</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes when I was an athlete teen. I would always be working out and had to smell good after practice. This is a wonderful product. Unfortunately they stopped selling it at my local shops and intern stopped buying it since they didn’t have it. I was thinking to myself one day and said OMG Amazon would probably have this! And yes they did for only $10 plus PRIME shipping amazing! I was sold still smells phenomenally delicious and my fianc&amp;eacute;e loves it!  I will most defiantly buy from again. Thanks so much for carrying this product! I hope you guys continue to sell this.</li>
    <li> like it well it is my favorite perfume to wear to work as it is light and does not overpower</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my 13 year old daughter and she LOVES it!</li>
    <li> Great ! Still that same smell I missed since 2012 ..couldn&#x27;t find it in Walmart but they had every other scent so thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> The order itself arrived in a shoebox, which I am very surprised by how unprofessional the seller packaged their products. Two of my bottles of perfume contain recognizable solids floating and swirling around my perfume which causes me to question whether the product has been tampered with or whether it is even the authentic product. Not only that, but one of the lids have been crack three inches, which prohibits the product from closing properly. There fore I have two bottles with unrecognizable substances and one cracked lid. Very unsatisfied overall. I would like for there to be some sort of compensation or replacement. I have yet to determine whether these bottles of perfume are legitimate. I will compare with a bottle I have from a REPUTABLE seller, aka Walmart.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite scents of all time..glad I found it on Amazon for a low price!..</li>
    <li> On time and as described! Great to work with.</li>
    <li> I love the scent.  Everybody&#x27;s skin will reflect a slightly different scent.  For me, it&#x27;s a light and slightly floral scent.  My favorite is still Adidas Moves for Her but this one is pretty nice too.  Clearly, the other reviewer doesn&#x27;t understand the difference between a \\&quot;product review\\&quot; and a \\&quot;seller feedback.\\&quot;  This is definitely a 4 or 5 star product.</li>
    <li> Excellent!!! Good fragrance...</li>
