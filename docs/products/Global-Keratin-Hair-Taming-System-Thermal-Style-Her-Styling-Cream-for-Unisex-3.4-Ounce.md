<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My hair stylist uses this in her salon. She recommended it to prevent heat damage from my blow dryer and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. I blow dry my hair our fully every other day and do minor touch ups with the blow dryer the other days. That is a lot of blow drying. I think this product has helped protect my hair, I&#x27;ve been using it for about 9 months and my hair has never been softer. It looks much healthier than it did last year with the same blow dry regimen. I mix this product with the pureology highlight stylist gold definer. I have naturally curly hair and this heat protectant plus the pureology is a great mix for blowing out curly hair.</li>
    <li> I love all GK products, but this is one of my favorites! It makes your hair smooth without feeling greasy and has a great scent! It helps my keratin treatment last longer.</li>
    <li> I never used this brand before and was concerned on the results but on the first use left my hair super soft and shiny. My husband liked how my hair looked and he started using the product for himself.</li>
    <li> I have tried using this product because it was recommended to me but the results produced were not the ones I anticipated.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this at all, made my hair dry and dull.</li>
    <li> I only used it twice, your hair feels silkier</li>
    <li> I use a dab of this combined with the Global Keratin leave in treatment on my damp hair. When I flat iron my curly hair it is smooth and shinny.</li>
    <li> Bought this product at my hair salon and loved it.&lt;br /&gt;Hair is soft and smooth after blowdrying. Great price too!</li>
    <li> I have a lot less frizz and my hair stays manageable a lot longer during the day when I use this product.</li>
    <li> I liked this product but there is another product similar to this that I think worked a lot better.</li>
    <li> The directions claim it&#x27;s to protect hair from heat (i.e., blow drying, straightening, etc)- but I use it like a leave-in conditioner. I put it on my damp hair, concentrating on the ends &amp; let my hair air-dry (fyi- I&#x27;ve already used the GK- Hair Taming Treatment). Result&#x3D; my hair has (very) soft waves &amp; curls- lots of volume, barely any frizz. It feels very healthy/moisturized &amp; not dried-out, like normally. It&#x27;s costly- but I&#x27;ll be buying it again for sure!</li>
    <li> Less expensive than my salon and extenda my expensive Keritan treatments</li>
    <li> This product is excellent. Specially for the ladies who likes to have the hair bouncy. It last and leaves hair shinny.</li>
    <li> Works great.  My hair is very manageable between hair appointments.  Same product that my hair dresser uses.  Much cheaper than you can buy locally.</li>
    <li> Must have for anyone with natural curly hair!  I am a professional hair styles with natural curly hair that also colors.  I like this product because it looks and feels like you used an oil, like morroccan oil (love too), BUT the difference is that it doesn&#x27;t weight the hair down as much and is still super shinny.  I have no problem going two days without shampooing------when you have natural curly hair that your straighten we don&#x27;t want to shampoo style daily!</li>
    <li> The product arrived quickly and I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Best product to use on think n course hair!!</li>
    <li> I use this every day when I blow dry my hair. It keeps my hair from getting too frizzy. It says it protects from heat, so I continue to use it. If you use too much, your hair can appear greasy. will continue to use</li>
    <li> This is a really good product if you have wavy or frizzy hair when blow drying your hair.  Keep your hair from all of the harsh treatments that we put our hair through.  Takes only a small amount and works great !</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using this product on my hair for over a year now and I absolutely love it.  It smells so wonderful and makes my hair smooth and silky.  My hair is very curly so that is quite a feat.  I hope it&#x27;s never discontinued.  It&#x27;s beyond anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Works great a fantastic product. It&#x27;s a great styling tool and good for your hair.  I love it and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have used this before but this is not the same smell, i think it is old maybe.</li>
    <li> This style cream  blends right in as soon as it touches your hair. It only takes a little dime size amount. Won&#x27;t use anything else anymore.</li>
    <li> This is great for styling hair and controlling frizz.</li>
    <li> I have fine, thin hair.  This product does a great job of protecting my hair from the heat associated with my blow dryer and flat iron without weighing my hair down.</li>
    <li> I prefer this over Nectar Thermique and it is less expensive too!</li>
