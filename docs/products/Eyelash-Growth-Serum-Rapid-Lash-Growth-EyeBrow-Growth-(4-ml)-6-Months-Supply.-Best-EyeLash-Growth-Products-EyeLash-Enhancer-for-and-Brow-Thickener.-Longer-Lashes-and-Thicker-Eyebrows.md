<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this for my partner who is not normally an &amp;#34;eyelash kind of girl&amp;#34;. She loves it. With 1 week of use she measured 1 mm of growth. She&#x27;s now planning to use the serum for a few months to get longer growth now that she knows it works. The brush is easy to use and the serum goes on smoothly (so she tells me). I think we have a winner. Highly recommend this for all you &amp;#34;other halves&amp;#34; who want to buy something for the &amp;#34;better half&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I am loving this product.Very easy to apply. Great for getting longer lashes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this now at least daily for two weeks.  It works!  My thin whispy eyelashes are now much fuller.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and with daily usage, you see results.  The only downfall was that there was a huge sticker covering the entire box, and didn&#x27;t come off very easily.  I had to look up ingredients and directions online!  Great customer service too!</li>
    <li> Totally recommend this. I have paid big bucks for eyelash growth products and this is by far the best! it isn&#x27;t thick and doesn&#x27;t stink or make my eyes itch! My eyelashes are already starting to grow which is huge as i have very thin and sparse lashes. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I really love this product , I don&#x27;t wear much makeup , but today I put my mascara on and I really noticed a difference my lashes are longer and fuller . Will continue to use for better results</li>
    <li> I used to get so many compliments on my long eyelashes but as I&#x27;ve gotten older I&#x27;ve noticed that my lashes had thinned and weren&#x27;t as full any longer so I jumped at the chance to try this product.  Incredulash Eyelash and brow growth serum actually stimulates and speeds up the growth of lashes and brows, I apply each morning after washing my face, you simply brush across, starting with your upper, inner lid, onto the skin where your lashes and skin meet.  The thin brush is easy to use and the serum there&#x27;s no irritation or residue.  I&#x27;ve been using for nearly 2 weeks now and  I already see a difference in my lashes, they&#x27;re a little longer and a little fuller.  With results like this so soon I can&#x27;t wait to see the difference in a month, the bottle provides 6 months of growth if used once daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price or the item was supplied to me in exchange for the purposes of a product review. All opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest &amp; unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I got this eyelash serum a few weeks ago with a launch coupon. I was a bit (very) skeptical about it and didn&#x27;t expect much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is smaller than I expected but then it is only 4 ml.&lt;br /&gt;After 3 weeks of use the level has not gone down so I guess it will last 6 months as the seller says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is easy to use just like putting on liquid eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed some other reviewers say that it stings or burns. I didn&#x27;t experience that though I suppose if I stuck a liquid eyeliner brush in my eye that would burn or sting too. I&#x27;ve had some friends try it out, and they didn&#x27;t have problems either..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the verdict. I took before and after photos like the seller said to, and was glad I did. Like others have said when I looked in the mirror after 3 weeks I noticed that my lashes were a bit thicker. I couldn&#x27;t see a difference in length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when I compared the before and after photos there was a real difference.&lt;br /&gt;It actually works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to keep going with this product for the next 6 months to finish the bottle and will probably get another after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a no brainer part of my morning routine.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve only been using this for a few days now, and I can&#x27;t say that it is or has made my lashes any longer but i do feel like they are darker and more pronounced in color without any mascara on... I will continue to use and see if it progresses!  Thanks, very happy with product as of now.</li>
    <li> Product goes on nicely because it&#x27;s a little thicker than the other eyelash serum I&#x27;ve tried. You only need to apply once a day and it will last you around 6 months. It does not irritate my eye like other one and it doesn&#x27;t look like you have it in ad it does not clump up.  I apply to my eyelashes and on my eyebrows where it is sparse. So far, my eyebrows are filling in and eyelashes look noticeably longer. I will continue using this to see more dramatic results.</li>
    <li> I have such stubbly eyelashes, I can&#x27;t wait to see the results.</li>
    <li> My eyelashes are already long. They haven&#x27;t grown from the time I used them. Used it constantly during the day only to irritate my eyes and surrounding areas.</li>
    <li> I just started using the product this week so I will have to update my review once I start seeing results. The shipping was quick and I bought the serum for a great price. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for a review.</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with this product. I did not think it would work this well and I am amazed at the growth that I am seeing.  It doesn&#x27;t have any prescription drugs either so it won&#x27;t cause discoloration of your eyes or skin.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this eyelash growth serum for a couple of weeks but I can already see a difference in the length of my lashes and good results so far. I can see some little new hairs growing as well and can&#x27;t wait to see better results in another couple weeks.  So far it&#x27;s working great.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! Works great!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for my wife, who normally is extremely picky about what she uses near her eyes. Right now, she loves the results she is getting (and she loves that I thought of giving her a gift :). I will add to this post after she has had more time to review it. This looks like it is a winner!</li>
    <li> This eyelash growth product is wonderful. I was a bit skeptic when I started using it but wanted to give it a try. In just a bit over one week I could see my lashes liooked longer and a bit thicker. Wiith daily use it has just fgotten better and better.&lt;br /&gt;It is well worth the price for the great results. I had no stinging or irritation of any sort.I didnt use it on my eyebrows as I did not need any help there.</li>
    <li> This worked really well! I have pics of before and after to show the difference! I didn&#x27;t use this on my eyebrows. I received this for a discount for an unbiased and honest review.</li>
    <li> This works very well. Thank you so much. It arrived fast and in great condition.</li>
    <li> I like any kind of eyelash products that accentuate my lashs. I observed a few changes with it. It has been just a week of my usage. Definitely a good purchase for me.</li>
    <li> excellent mascara and i will but again!</li>
    <li> I have to wait for weeks to make a review because I am very anxious to know the result of this product to myself. This is a reliable product and it works! I have a very short eyelashes and its disappointing to apply mascara because even after applying it doesn&#x27;t look obvious, My lashes don&#x27;t curl up and it just stays straight. After constantly applying this, my eyelashes grew longer and it becomes nicer after putting mascara. Don&#x27;t be afraid to try it to yourself.</li>
    <li> We have all seen the commercials for the product that increases eyelash growth and it&#x27;s something that we all want and/or need. Well, more like want! I&#x27;m not going to see my doctor to discuss my healthy lashes and then pay for a prescribed product. That is just not happening here! I can see though, like purchasing a mascara doing the same when it comes to using a serum. I buy serums for my skin, so why not buy something for my lashes too?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VIDI is a skincare company that offers an eyelash/eyebrow serum as part of their beauty line. This is my first time working with VIDI and they were kind enough to send me the product to give it a 4-week try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IncreduLASH is a product that nourishes your own natural eyelashes and promotes growth, plus it comes with 0% of the risks and side effects, which are associated with other products on the market, including the prescribed brands. Permanent darkening of my eye&#x27;s skin is not something I am willing to risk when the dark circles look is not my cup of tea! It&#x27;s a serum that can be applied to encourage growth to your eyebrows in case you plucked one too many in your lifetime or with age, we tend to start getting growth that is no longer fuller or longer in length. I&#x27;m so far so good when it comes to my lashes and thankfully I was blessed with both eyebrows that are as full as my lashes. I just wanted to enhance the look and also test how effective and how quick it worked. It took me 3 months to get Coconut oil to show it&#x27;s effects on my eyebrows when I read they need to be moisturized too. Eyebrow gels, cosmetics, and anything you use to temporarily darken or make your eyebrows look fuller and thicker......well, they tend to stress them out too. Yup, that means you get thinning and just loss of hairs and lashes, which then means you need more cosmetics to get the look you want that is being compromised by the product(s) you use (the never ending cycle).  I use a clear eyebrow gel and I noticed that my skin, plus the hairs get dehydrated over time. I then started to apply oils to my eyebrows but this is only something I can do at night, as oily eyebrows is not something I have heard is the &amp;#34;gotta have it&amp;#34; look at the moment :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application:&lt;br /&gt;Simple to apply and like anything you use in that area, just watch it when it comes to getting it in your eye. Hey, even Coconut oil hurts when it starts travelling into my eye! You simply take the wand and brush along the eye&#x27;s skin where your lashes start (the root, per say). One continuous stroke on each eye and done. You also apply the serum after freshly washing your face because the surface must be clean and free of anything else, like with most serums should be applied to any skin area (i.e. thinner product in texture gets applied first). You only use it once a day too, so it really is easy to work into any beauty regimen. For eyebrow use, the same application principle as your eyes applies and make sure the product dries and absorbs before applying anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:&lt;br /&gt;I added IncreduLASH to my nightly beauty routine and used it only once a day on my lashes. I use the product as a &amp;#34;spot corrector&amp;#34; on one eyebrow because I had an &amp;#34;oops&amp;#34; while plucking and created a spot that was missing 2 to 3 hairs. Yes, my spot would eventually yield hairs again but I&#x27;m a girl that has little patience when it comes to my boo-boos being corrected. The serum by VIDI states most start seeing results within 2 weeks. I can say by 2.5 weeks, my lashes felt and looked nicer. I had zero stragglers like when you have those mini lashes that began to grow and they are too short to notice before you apply mascara, but then obstruct your vision once you do! Those mini lashes drive me crazy and I then have to use the mascara wand&#x27;s tip to make them stick to a lash-buddy that is of normal length......I have also plucked them when they don&#x27;t play nice. Yes, it starts the process of growing again but I then hope the new lash heard the screams of the last lash being plucked and will behave :). It was nice not having to deal with shorties, so that was a definite positive that I saw from IncreduLASH&#x27;s results. I also found the texture of the hairs were enhanced I lost less when I curled my lashes and/or washed the mascara off. Sometimes I even lost none! Next, the spot on my eyebrow. What spot? By week three the spot was a thing of the pass and from my experience, it would take me a month and a half to see those mistakes show any hairs that are long enough and I did not need to blot some eyebrow pencil to cover it up. IncreduLASH does work and because you use so little product upon application, it makes the investment sting less when it comes to sticker price. I use less mascara and like this natural fuller lash look that did not need a doctor&#x27;s visit to get. I&#x27;m a DIY gal and especially when it comes to beauty solutions and IncreduLASH is a soultion that works, plus VIDI guarantees it!

    <li> I started using this for several weeks in a row.  I applied it daily.  And, since I was having some hair issues, one issue was my eyelashes were short, and not full as they previously were.  I am also on medication for a short term, but my medication is not improving my lashes, nor meant to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But,  after a few weeks, I actually noticed a difference.  My eyelashes were back to their original length and thickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle is small, narrow, and reading the description, there is a small amount of serum here.  You use the fine brush and apply it only to the top lid.  Use it daily.  It is safe, and if you get a tiny bit too close to the inner eye, not to worry, it will not cause reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes,  after several weeks,  I feel confident that this made my lashes grow!!  Excellent.  Product for review....  Rizzo</li>
    <li> Seems to be working pretty well. It is easy to put on, and everything seems to be easy to use. I have also had a family member and friend that have been using this, and they love it as well. It is a little weird that it was clear, and kind of thicker then I thought, but still love it, love what it does , and love what its doing. :)</li>
    <li> So far I am happy with this product . I have been using the serum for two weeks and can already see result.</li>
    <li> great product. Hope to see the results soon</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to give it 5 stars. Doesn&#x27;t burn or itch. Does not have a smell. Will update</li>
    <li> I have noticed a slight thickening of my lashes. I want to continue testing this to see just how much of a difference there is from when I started. I&#x27;ll come back and post before and after pics next month. Stay tuned...</li>
    <li> Was fine. But nothing like Careprost  (generic latisse ) only $25 from [...]</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference fairly quickly and am thrilled with the results. I used to have long, this k eyelashes but they are thining over the past few years. Wish I knew about this product sooner!</li>
    <li> There are so many reasons that I love this serum! My lashes look great without mascara. They are darker, fuller and longer too. I love that unlike it&#x27;s rx counterpart IncreduLash doesn&#x27;t cause any eye discoloration. LOVE that!! This serum hasn&#x27;t irritated my eyes except when I got a little too much serum on the brush, a small amount got in my eye and burned for about 3 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;I love that this is a once a day formula! It goes on just like a liquid eyeliner. It’s clear, it dries quickly and IT WORKS!!&lt;br /&gt;While this Eyelash Growth Serum is a small bottle, you use such a small amount that, used daily this bottle will last you for 6 months!!  Remember you don’t need a lot of serum on the brush, a little goes a long way!! Don&#x27;t give up!! Keep using it! Your lashes will only get darker, fuller and longer!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really impressed! I absolutely did not think that this product was going to work. I purchased it with a discount, and was asked to leave my review after I tried it. I&#x27;ve been using it daily for 2 weeks now. On my left eye. Yes, I tried to see if it was actually doing anything by comparing my own left eye to my own right eye. Well, I&#x27;m now starting to put it on both, because I&#x27;ve definitely noticed improvement in thickness of eyelashes. New ones have sprouted up. The old lashes did not really get longer, though. Just thicker, basically. Which works for me, because I have pretty long lashes to begin with. I&#x27;ll continue to use this serum, since it looks like it actually works.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the question about the color? It&#x27;s serum so it&#x27;s transparent or are they asking if your eyelashes got darker. This Saturday will be two weeks &amp; I&#x27;m already seeing results. I was left without eyelashes after removing the cosmetic ones. I can see they&#x27;re growing. I&#x27;m expecting for better results after the two weeks though. And I apply it twice a day because I was desperate lol</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for just a few days from now so I am not expecting to see results in an instant. It feels like I&#x27;m wearing a normal mascara so having it on my eyelash doesn&#x27;t really bother me. I&#x27;ll stick to it for a few more days and  see if it does really do anything.</li>
    <li> got this item about a week ago and have started seeing results I am greatly impressed by this product</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves it. She says she didn&#x27;t believe it would work on her since her eyelashes are unruly but it definitely changed her mind.</li>
    <li> This eyelash serum is really good. My lashes grows fast and thick. This is really effective. I love it</li>
    <li> Pleased with the fact that their claims of lengthening lashes is TRUE!  Doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes like similar products that claim to do the same.</li>
    <li> I would say this stuff actually works. I&#x27;m surprised because I was skeptical. I find that my lashes look a bit longer and fluffier. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> Great product would recommend.</li>
    <li> This was easy to apply - I applied it at night time after cleansing my face &amp; before getting into bed. Make sure to let it dry completely so none of it gets into your eyes (this happened to me once and I had to use an eye wash because it burned!) But I definitely notice a difference in my lashes! I forgot to take before and after pictures but I can definitely tell and will continue to use this!</li>
    <li> I was scared at first to use this on my brows for fear of bushy eyebrows, but mine are very blonde and thin. It has definitely helped them fill in, but not bushy. :) I have noticed my lashes are longer, I cannot say fuller but definitely longer. I have missed a few days though. I am excited to what they look like in a couple of weeks!</li>
    <li> Oh My gosh you guys!! Ok i write reviews  a lot.  On many other sites other than Amazon and this is one of the few times where Ive actually been this excited about a product.  I am absolutely blown away.  My eyelashes have never looked better. Which is funny because i always thought they looked pretty good to start with. My lashes have always been pretty long.  But never really as dark or thick as i wanted them to be.  Nothing a few coats of mascara couldnt fix tho.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product took my eyelashes from &amp;#34;yeah they look nice&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;Ooooh La-La!!&amp;#34;. I have been using this product once a day befroe bed for about a week and a half, and let me tell you, my eyelashes already look amazing. Even though it says you should start noticing the difference after two weeks. And actually- heres another interesting fact, I actually noticed a difference after just the 3rd day!! But I thought to myself that is was probably just a placebo effect.  Well not that more time went by, I can honestly see I really do see a change and its not just in my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main thing i noticed is that they just look alot darker and thicker.  I see a tiny bit more length but not a whole lot (yet).  BUUUUT, like I mentioned before, my eyelashes were pretty long to start with so IDK how much more length ill get but im happy with everything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The magic really happens when I apply mascara.  I dont have to use so many coats anymore.  They look full, long, thick and whispy!!  Im in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyelashes were great before, never had to wear falsies or anything like that, just a ton of mascara but this eyelash serum took them to a whole other level.  I will most cetainly be purchasing!!!</li>
    <li> This eyelash growth serum comes in a very small bottle, 0.13 oz, about a skinny lipstick size.  The serum is clear and easily applied to the base of eyelash with the provided applicator.  This product is to be used just once per day, which enhances my compliance and the application only requires very little amount of the serum; however, I&#x27;m not sure how long this 0.13 oz bottle will last.  I have sensitive skin, but absolutely have no adverse reaction from using it.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 days and not yet seeing progress.  According to the e-user manual from the seller, one may see 25% growth in 2 weeks and 75% growth in 6 weeks.  I&#x27;m eager to see result and surely will come back to update in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> This product requires just a quick swipe over the top of your upper lid to work. It is not a mascara, therefore, it is clear. It helps the eyelashes and brows grow. I do not put it on my brows, as they are fine. I do want longer lashes like I used to have and this is a perfect alternative to prescriptions without side effects. If it gets in your eyes, you are applying too much. It only takes a swipe and should not be drippy at all. I also use fiber lash mascara and this is even enhancing that product by making my own lashes longer.</li>
    <li> After i use for a week i can tell my eye lashes looks thicker and darker. I love the results!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it happens to everyone, but over the years my eyelashes have slowly disappeared. Well, not totally. They are still there but definitely not like they were when I younger. They used to be long and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really happy with IncreduLash Eyelash Growth Serum and see results in just 3 weeks of using it. My eyes are sensitive and I had no irritation or itching while using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not one for fake eyelashes so to be able get longer lashes naturally, count me in!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for only 4 days now but I can already see a difference in my lash length and little hairs growing in the sparse parts of my eyebrows.  I&#x27;m definitely a happy customer!  Also the seller emailed me a very nice email to ensure I received and was happy with the product. I thought that was really nice of them.</li>
    <li> Got this about 6 weeks ago on a trial offer with the hope that it would work to lengthen my lashes and IT WORKED!!!!  Seeing is believing. I am very pleased with the results.  Now I have lashes to curl. There are still so much solution left in the bottle after 6 weeks of use. This is going to last me for months.</li>
    <li> I was about to write a four star review, saying that it probably works but will not exceed your expectation, when I took a selfie and got shocked by how much longer and thicker my eyelashes have become! Oh my! I also talked to my friend on skype today and all I did before the video chat is painting my eyelashes (which I do most of the time) and she complimented me on my eyes! It was even seen on the camera! Very impressed. Seriously. Worked better than I ever thought it would.</li>
    <li> Ok. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and my eye brows are actually getting fuller. I wasn&#x27;t sure at first if it would would work but I kept putting it on and now I&#x27;m so excited. Finally seeing results :). Will be buying again. Thank you vidi for making something that works and I didn&#x27;t waste my time or money :)</li>
    <li> The bottle is a bit smaller than I expected, but has the desired result.  It doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation, even when I accidentally got it in my eye.</li>
    <li> Amazing product snd my eyelashes became more thick</li>
    <li> Have not noticed a difference. I&#x27;ve had success with RapidLash, Fanomenal and of course Latisse, but this doesn&#x27;t seem to work.</li>
    <li> I tried this product because it was offered to me at a deep discount for a fair review.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the RX version and many others since. The RX left tan marks, which I was told happens in more than half the people. It&#x27;s also heavier.&lt;br /&gt;This is one of my favorites I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s light and no tan marks. I&#x27;ve used ones that the next morning after washing face mascara didn&#x27;t go on quite right but this is also not the case with this product. I&#x27;ll update on progress.</li>
    <li> If you apply this in any way to your eye. it can irritate. But ive had it for a month now and I already have seen improvement. make sure to take before pictures. Also, I apply above the lashes (like eyeliner) and under (like in the eye line area-I forget whats its called). Tube looks small but it goes a long way</li>
    <li> Love it, love it. Already I&#x27;m seeing a difference in my lashes. My lashes are already longer and thicker. Yippee!</li>
    <li> This did not do anything for me. I used it twice a day for 6 weeks. Not any changes at all.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen or noticed a difference... Yet!</li>
    <li> So far seems to be working it actually is making my lashes seem fuller more to come with this review.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my eyebrows were very uneven and had spots where hair wouldn&#x27;t grow. I was not very consistent with the use, yet I have seen great results. My eyebrows are even and the holes are filled in. I am grateful I found this product and would recommend it to anyone who wants fuller brows. No side effects.</li>
    <li> I am reviewing for brows only. I do not use on my eyelashes. I have forever had a sparse patch on my eyebrows. I&#x27;ve been using for a couple of weeks now and I see more growth. More in areas that I didn&#x27;t really need it and less where I have my bald type patch, but I&#x27;m optimistic and will continue to use and see how it goes.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I purchased this product but I am officially a believer! I have been using it for about 3-4 weeks now and have seen remarkable improvement in the length of my lashes. One of the reasons why I was skeptical was because I have fairly long lashes to begin with so I didn&#x27;t expect it to do much--but my lashes have literally turned into falsies! :D I used to have just one &amp;#34;row: of eyelashes but after this, I swear it seems like I have 2-3 &amp;#34;rows&amp;#34; of lashes! YAYYY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not been super consistent and do forget to apply this some nights but I&#x27;m still getting results! A tip for newbies: don&#x27;t load up on the serum thinking that it&#x27;s going to work extra well if your lashes are covered in this! If this gets in your eyes, it BURNS. So it&#x27;s better if it stays just on the roots of your lashes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Revitalash in the past but decided to give this brand a try!  Might work well for others, but for me, it just didn&#x27;t work at all!  I was disappointed!  :-(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really liking this product the couple of days I&#x27;ve used it. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, goes on fine under makeup, and is easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak to the effectiveness of it just yet, but so far I&#x27;m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried similar products in the past but they turned my eyelids red and made my eyes water. Not the case here.</li>
    <li> I got this eyelash serum a few weeks ago with a launch coupon. I was a bit (very) skeptical about it and didn&#x27;t expect much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is smaller than I expected, so I am giving it 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;After 3 weeks of use the level has not gone down so I guess it will last 6 months as the seller says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is easy to use just like putting on liquid eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed some other reviewers say that it stings or burns. I didn&#x27;t experience that though I suppose if I stuck a liquid eyeliner brush in my eye that would burn or sting too. I&#x27;ve had some friends try it out, and they didn&#x27;t have problems either..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the verdict. I took before and after photos like the seller said to, and was glad I did. Like others have said when I looked in the mirror after 3 weeks I noticed that my lashes were a bit thicker. I couldn&#x27;t see a difference in length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when I compared the before and after photos there was a real difference.&lt;br /&gt;It actually works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to keep going with this product for the next 6 months to finish the bottle and will probably get another after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a no brainer part of my morning routine. Still recommend it.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference within a week... no eye irritation, no odd smells. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I got this free for my review.  I don&#x27;t see any huge difference. A little longer, but not thicker.  And it burns! Ohhh does it burn! I put it on, and leave my eyes closed for 5 minutes. Otherwise, it gets in my eyes, and burns like nothing else!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this lash growth serum!!!! My eyelashes are Sooo much Longer &amp; Thicker!!! I use it in the morning under my makeup and at night. I apply it like an eyeliner at the base of my top lashes on the lash line,only using the little soft brush at the end. I haven&#x27;t had any irritation at all! The ingredients are really amazing in it as well, making for long, thick lashes, without any side effects!! I will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> seems to be making a difference after 3 weeks ..try it</li>
    <li> like little shorter than short as closer length to natural lashes.  As for color I prefer &#x27;brown&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;do you even offer color brown?</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive eyes and my lashes are quite thin, so i was skeptical as I have tried oodles of other products with no results or allergic reactions.  I have been using this product for a few weeks and I am finally seeing results!  The serum causes no reactions, so that is great and I have been taking weekly pictures and can definitely see that my lashes are thicker!  Can&#x27;t wait to see them after three months!</li>
    <li> Ive been using it on my eyebrows and I can see a difference in the thickness of my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Great product. Can&#x27;t wait to use it long enough to see results</li>
    <li> I’ve been using this for a few weeks. It’s my first Eyelash Growth Serum so I was really excited about it. I have noticed that my lashes seem a little fuller and are a little darker. I haven’t noticed any difference in length but perhaps that will change with longer use. This doesn’t irritate my eyes at all. It does feel like there is something on my lash line for a little bit, but then the feeling just sort of goes away. It’s pretty easy to use along with my skincare routine so I do it after my show. I definitely have not noticed any side effects since I started using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube comes in a cardboard box that has company and product information on it. The eyelash serum comes in a clear tube with a silver eyeliner brush wand. It has product and company information on it. It’s a clear liquidy gel that has a sweet clean scent. It’s slightly tacky when it dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Aqua (Water), Glycerine, Hydrolyed Starch Phosphate, Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate, Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17, Pterocarpus Marsupium Bark Extract, Malus Domestica (Apple) Fruit Cell Culture Extract, Mannitol, Panthenol (D), Glutamic Acid (L), Xanthan Gum, Lecithin 1, 2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Chloride Disodium Succinate, Tropolone, Phenoxyethanol, Phytic Acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchance for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> product was dried up inside</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it! Getting older and my eyelashes were thinning...this is bringing them back! Yayyyyy!</li>
    <li> This is a great alternative to products like Latisse! It causes no irritation and it affordable!</li>
    <li> This serum is really awesome! It helped to make my lashes fuller. The only issue I had was that it was hard to use at first. Once I got the hang of how to apply it, it worked awesomly!</li>
    <li> This is colorless, odorless, and only needs to be applied once daily (I do it at night before going to bed). This is a liquid, but it&#x27;s not too &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; or runny when I apply it. It has some amazing ingredients in it, like peptides, apple stem cells, and beneficial botanicals. The bottle lasts for 6 months and you can easily apply it with the thin brush inside. Make sure to clean your eye makeup off completely before applying this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all, but it did leave them a bit itchy. This is not unusual at all. Most of these types of eyelash serums make my eyes itch SO bad and a lot of them irritate my eyes to the point that they start burning, so I&#x27;ve been on a quest for the right serum ever since. This one doesn&#x27;t itch when you apply it, but in the morning when I wake up, it&#x27;s usually a little itchy, but not anything that lingers. For this reason, I like to use this more on my eyebrows. For instance, if I&#x27;ve been wearing fake lashes for the day, then I won&#x27;t use this on my eyelashes at night, I&#x27;ll only put it on my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I haven&#x27;t religiously used this on my eyelashes everyday, I&#x27;ve seen a slight improvement in my lashes and a huge difference in my eyebrows. I&#x27;ve never missed a day using this on my brows for the last month and it shows. My eyebrows are usually a bit sparse in areas and this has made them way darker and thicker. I should have taken before photos, but I didn&#x27;t think the difference would be as dramatic as it is. My eyebrows are much darker where I have been applying this and in terms of my eyelashes, I noticed they are a bit longer and thicker, but I really should be using it everyday on my lashes too for the full effect. Great serum, amazing ingredients, and way, way less irritating on my sensitive eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie I was skeptical. But this really works!  I noticed longer eyelashes with in 2-3 weeks.  The felt stronger and a little fuller at the base.  I will be re-ordering!</li>
    <li> Packaged in a 4 ML tube with a small brush just like liquid eyeliner. Very easy to apply once a day. Color is clear and has no odor. I have used this 5 nights now and had no irritation at all. I have used other lash serums in the past and I do know to use them sparingly and not let them run in your eyes. Just one line above upper lash line at base of lashes is all you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen a little darkening and &amp;#34;healthy growth&amp;#34;. Meaning, I use an eye lash curler every day and have a very low thyroid I take meds for and I lose an eye lash or 2 I see almost every single day. The last 2 days I have not lost a lash I noticed and mine are so thin trust me I notice missing just one, I could count my eyelashes if I wanted to. I know it will take at least 2 weeks to see much difference. Other serums I have seen a difference in 2-4 weeks IF they worked, some no difference at all. This one has Pentepeptide-17 and apple fruit cells, (stem cells) in it and I have found those are the ones that do work. For me right now it is at least making mine more healthy to not fall out so they can grow which is a big improvement. I would highly recommend this to anyone and i am using it on my eye brows also since they are as thin as my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is prostaglandin free and paraben free, not tested on animals with a money back guarantee, try it, but I don&#x27;t think you will want to return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this product on a promotional discount for my honest review and they are 100% my own opinions.

    <li> I&#x27;ve used this eyelash serum before and bought it again because I love it. I&#x27;ve used other similar products but this one tops them.</li>
    <li> When I received this review sample, I passed it along to my wife who wrote the following evaluation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Incredu Eyelash and Brow Serum is a growth serum that really works. As the years have passed, I have lost more and more eyelashes but especially more brow lashes. While recently shopping at the Ulta cosmetic store, one of the sales clerks told me that the fastest way to judge a woman&#x27;s age is to see how long her eyelashes are and how many eyelashes she has left. This was sobering for me as I have been losing many lashes over the past five years. This serum combined with a good brow color brush has made my eyelashes look longer and fuller and my brows are growing back slowly.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I jist received this today and had to try it right away. Its easy to put on. I cant wait to see the results. Which ill be sure to come back and post a picture of.</li>
