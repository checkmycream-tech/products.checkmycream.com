      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for the perm to natural hair transition.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 months now; I love the way it gives shine and body to my hair; I also love how it controls frizz.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;ll make your hair more manageable.</li>
      <li>Especially on hot stubborn summer days.</li>
      <li>It works better on relaxed hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not like the original!</li>
      <li>For best results follow directions, someone wrote it is too heavy, this product is from concentrate so use sparingly and be sure to hold the can 10-12 inches from hair.</li>
      <li>The globules hang in the air and are easily visible.</li>

      <li>I give thanks to Ateena on youtube because this is how I first heard of this amazing oil sheen!</li>
      <li>This is worth the money!</li>
      <li>the humidity black is wonderful in hot climates</li>
      <li>I wrap my hair at night then spray, wake up in the morning then spray again and after all that my hair still isnt greasy..just a nice natural looking shine...</li>
      <li>Avlon KeraCare Oil Sheen with Humidity Block smells good and leave a nice shine to your hair.....will purchased again in the near future.</li>
      <li>The product size I got was 10 oz not 11 oz&lt;br /&gt;same product, but the container was the gold one (not the color in the picture)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;okay, but other than that, this product is great.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t completely block frizz 100%, but it did a pretty good job, so I think it&#x27;s worth buying</li>
      <li>I also love that it is not heavy and does not build up on my hair.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t really help my hair when it came to humidity and is full of alcohol.</li>
      <li>I recommend this for anyone who has dry hair and wants a healthy but not greasy look.</li>
      <li>I get bouncy straight hair every time.</li>
      <li>This product really protects your hair from humidity.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend using this on your ends to keep them moisturized and prevent breakage.  </li>
      <li>But I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I just love this it isn&#x27;t to heavy</li>
      <li>This will be my &#x27;new&#x27; oil sheen.  </li>
      <li>I have allergies and am sensitive to new smells, and I find that this product sometimes makes my eyes burn and head</li>
      <li>I recently started using this line and it has rained/sleeted almost every day since and my hair is still straight.  </li>
      <li>You really have to moderate how you spray it.  </li>
      <li>I was using a different frizz block spray previously, but the KeraCare spray definitely held up better against humidity.</li>
      <li>Most oil sheens that I have used would go on greasy but left my hair dull.  </li>
      <li>It left my daughter&#x27;s hair soft and had a sheen which was not overly oily.</li>
      <li>but overall this oil sheen is better than any other one that I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
      <li>I guess it&#x27;s fine as oil sheens go, but was a little too heavy for my hair.  </li>

    <li> this is a heavy sheen spray. The globules hang in the air and are easily visible. Too heavy.</li>
    <li> Avlon KeraCare Oil Sheen with Humidity Block was just what I needed.  The product gave my hair the proper amount of sheen, and did not leave residue or dullness at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> This has got to be the best oil sheen I have ever used!  I sprayed a little on my hair prior to blow-drying and my hair was so shiny but not greasy.  My ends tend to stay dry so I sprayed some one my ends.  My ends stay moisturized and shiny but never greasy.  Most oil sheens that I have used would go on greasy but left my hair dull.  Profectiv oil sheen left my hair too greasy.  Keracare is the truth!  I highly recommend using this on your ends to keep them moisturized and prevent breakage.  This is worth the money!</li>
    <li> Worked just as the product says.  It actually stops the frizz.</li>
    <li> The product is amazing and does wonders for my hair.  I was impressed with the product and I didnt have to wait long to recieve it.  I recommend this for anyone who has dry hair and wants a healthy but not greasy look.</li>
    <li> This oil sheen is excellent. It came packaged very nicely. My hair looks a little dry usually but it looked brand new after I sprayed a little of this product on it. I am very pleased. I also love that it is not heavy and does not build up on my hair. Try it, it is awesome! For best results follow directions, someone wrote it is too heavy, this product is from concentrate so use sparingly and be sure to hold the can 10-12 inches from hair. If you do this your hair will look healthier than ever!</li>
    <li> Excellent finishing spray it&#x27;s not too oily like a traditional oil sheen. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> I love this sheen! I run out a while ago&lt;br /&gt;I need more! ASAP</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. It works better on relaxed hair.</li>
    <li> This will be my &#x27;new&#x27; oil sheen.  It&#x27;s perfect for the perm to natural hair transition.  I recommend it.  It&#x27;ll make your hair more manageable.</li>
    <li> I abso love this oil sheen!  It&#x27;s not greasy and there&#x27;s no white build up.  The smell is pleasant and the canister is beautiful.  I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> The product size I got was 10 oz not 11 oz&lt;br /&gt;same product, but the container was the gold one (not the color in the picture)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;okay, but other than that, this product is great.

    <li> I recently started using this line and it has rained/sleeted almost every day since and my hair is still straight.  I use it along with the Creme Press and Silk Sheen.  I also use the shampoo and conditioner from the same line.  This has convinced me to keep my hair blown out.  I get bouncy straight hair every time.</li>
    <li> I guess it&#x27;s fine as oil sheens go, but was a little too heavy for my hair.  Based on other reviews, I thought it would be a lighter sheen</li>
    <li> Leaves hair very geasy and hard.  not worth the buy</li>
    <li> I like the product. But don&#x27;t see how it is very different from other oil sheens. Good product but a bit over-priced in my opinion.</li>
    <li> You really have to moderate how you spray it.  I just spray on my hands rub it in then blott on my hair.</li>
    <li> Avlon KeraCare Oil Sheen with Humidity Block smells good and leave a nice shine to your hair.....will purchased again in the near future.</li>
    <li> I just love this it isn&#x27;t to heavy and the price was awesome the humidity black is wonderful in hot climates Thank you</li>
    <li> I used this went I had relaxed hair. It didn&#x27;t really help my hair when it came to humidity and is full of alcohol. I hated the smell.</li>
    <li> The product works as stated. It left my daughter&#x27;s hair soft and had a sheen which was not overly oily. I would highly recommend this product for someone who has a problem with dry, frizzy hair due to humid climate such as climates of tropical lands.</li>
    <li> It gets the job done. No freeze here</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;ve used this I never want to used any other oil sheen again. No lie!!! This product really protects your hair from humidity. I use it on my daughters hair since she has a bigger issue with humidity and hair than I do and hair stays flat iron, curled, or whatever....for longer periods on times. Especially on hot stubborn summer days.</li>
    <li> Excellent sheen - good quality product -  though care should be taken to use sparingly.  Best in class own the market.</li>
    <li> Did not like this hair spray! It&#x27;s not like the original! It didn&#x27;t protect my hair against humidity and left my hair looking greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 months now; I love the way it gives shine and body to my hair; I also love how it controls frizz. Every since I&#x27;ve been using it I don&#x27;t use hair grease in my hair anymore. I just wish that you can purchase it at your local beauty supply store.But I would highly recommend this product.</li>
