      <li>When I saw this trial package, I thought it was a good</li>
      <li>Lots of research and redevelopment has gone into their products and I have loved the Pro-X line.  </li>
      <li>Delivery was timely and the price was good.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So all that said about maintenance, it is important to have an excellent moisturizing cream with SPF during the day (even cloudy days-solar energy is radiation-want that on your face??  </li>
      <li>The \\&quot;wrinkle smoothing cream\\&quot; is my favorite, it feels great going on and makes my skin feel good.</li>

      <li>This kit is the perfect way to do so, because you can try the products without a large investment.  </li>
      <li>Lol What is important to me are reviews that target MY age group...</li>
      <li>I did notice an amazing clarity of my complexion.</li>
      <li>Nice and silky.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice fragrance, and isn&#x27;t greasy or oily.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this kit for a bit over a month so maybe it needs more time to do its magic, but it&#x27;s not as great as I had hoped.  </li>
      <li>I am so thrilled with this.  </li>
      <li>I am delighted and satisfied with the results of the Pro-X Intensive Wrinkle Treatment.  </li>
      <li>Very happy so far with the results.</li>
      <li>I still like the Regenerist Elixer - more effective for my skin that Pro-X.</li>
      <li>Olay Professional Pro-X Intensive Wrinkle Protocol 1 Kit is wonderful.  </li>
      <li>The crows feet and laugh lines are greatly reduced with the use of the product.</li>
      <li>My new routine is to use the wonderful Intensive Repair Treatment (one of the items in the kit) where my wrinkles are prominent, and the Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Cream over all of my face (instead of the wrinkle cream in the kit).  </li>
      <li>Yes, it&#x27;s good for a laugh, but also exercises the myriad of muscles in our face and gets the blood flowing!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using these items for several months now, it is a very nice moisturizing set with a great sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>At 61, I have very smooth skin.  </li>
      <li>I reminded them it was ok to say they couldn&#x27;t tell, as that would save me money.</li>
      <li>I love the Pro X line.  </li>
      <li>I still love the Pro X Intensive Wrinkle Kit with one caveat.  </li>
      <li>perfect, I wanted to try Olay products, but I will go back to Nia 24</li>
      <li>However, I like Olay Pro-X&#x27;s Skin Tightening Serum and Hydra Firming Cream better.</li>
      <li>Love the products of Oil of Olay, use it every day would not do without ity.</li>
      <li>The face cream is kind of pasty and not as smooth as others I have used</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used \\&quot;OIL of OLAY\\&quot; products for many years, no complaints.</li>
      <li>I have tried most things out on the Market from Lancome to the Olay Regenerist, etc.  </li>
      <li>I love all the Olay products and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
      <li>It works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried - and I&#x27;ve used a lot.</li>
      <li>The moisturizer keeps my skin moist but the deep wrinkle product is AWESOME.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love Olay products and have used them for years.  </li>
      <li>I find it to be more work than I want to do twice a day and see no difference.  </li>
      <li>I love this product vs Clinique&#x27;s anti-wrinkle products.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Actually, I have red patches on my cheeks from it.&lt;br /&gt;Not happy with it!</li>
      <li>Therefore, I don&#x27;t plan to buy more of the day lotion, but will use the night cream both day and night.  </li>
      <li>cream has a nice rich-yet light and non-greasy-texture.  </li>
      <li>I ordered the Pro X and find it to be ok.  </li>
      <li>My skin looks much better with Olay.</li>
      <li>Which I feel better about.  </li>
      <li>He had the top dermatoligist in the country on his show.  </li>
      <li>I love the Olay Pro-X line, and have been using it for about 2 years now.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing how much more the Pro X will do after I&#x27;ve been using it for a month or more</li>
      <li>it works best all the time, I have used many different brands but none stands against Olay.</li>
      <li>It really works, I have been using it for over a month and results are great.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t a drastic change, but my skin seemed smoother and had more of a glow to it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a terrific face cream.atives, Amazon&#x27;s price is very good, possibly the best.  </li>
      <li>worth the investment!!</li>
      <li>It clarifies my skin and minimizes fine lines and gives my skin a healthy glow.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product for the cost. Night cream is thick and only takes a small amount.</li>
    <li> I have used Olay products for several years after watching Dr Oz.  He had the top dermatoligist in the country on his show.  He told the viewing audience that are buying the high end products at the high end cosmetic counters was a waste of  our money .  I was a former user of Estée Lauder and others.  I switched Olay  which was his recommendation.  People do not believe I am almost 69 years old.  I have saved a ton of $$$</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 52, and have dry skin.  This made my skin more dry.  I never had this happen with other olay products.  This really isnt a moisturizer, may help skin in other ways, but I had to stop cause of dryness.</li>
    <li> ** Using my husband&#x27;s id**  Well, I had this a my doorstep today, thanks for the free shipping here at Amazon. Opened the box, read the instructions and went right to work. Both the eye cream and the lotion really go on smooth and gets immediately absorbed onto the skin.  I put on make up as usual and didn&#x27;t wash my face until late night. When I washed my face to put on the PM regimen(eye cream and wrinkle cream), my face looked like a light bulb..with just one use. It&#x27;s too early to see proper results with this, but  will update here. With the very first use, my skin feels smoother, softer for an even application for makeup.Really like it..I&#x27;ll stick to the regimen and see how it delivers over the coming weeks.</li>
    <li> Excellent results and Value</li>
    <li> Love the products of Oil of Olay, use it every day would not do without ity.</li>
    <li> This is a great product been using olay pro x for a few years now and love it. Will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> I love Olay products and have used them for years.  I ordered the Pro X and find it to be ok.  It leaves my skin a little on the oily side in comparison to the other Olay products.  I have not noticed any real change in my skins appearance other than an occasional breakout due to the added moisture in this product.      I will continue to use Olay products however, I will probably go back to the Regenerist line.</li>
    <li> works really well.  i don&#x27;t know that it reduces wrinkles that much, but it&#x27;s definitely a good moisturizing system.</li>
    <li> These Pro-X products are the best I&#x27;ve used for moisturizing and diminishing wrinkles. They are costly for my budget but I&#x27;d rather give up something else and get the best skin care.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought Olay at Amazon you can&#x27;t beat the price and it really works on my wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t personally know much about this but what I can tell you is that my wife absolutely loves this face cleaning gizmo and the cleanser that goes with it. What a teriffic hit of a gift!</li>
    <li> It goes one smoothly, is light and yet seems to do the job.  Now we will see if it eventually makes a difference.  Only time will tell about that.  For now, I like it very much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Olay products.  I am delighted and satisfied with the results of the Pro-X Intensive Wrinkle Treatment.  This is my second go-around and I intend to continue.  If you want to have younger looking, firm and elastic skin, this is the product for you.  One of the great benefits I find is its ability to even skin tones.  Another great product by Olay...thank you.</li>
    <li> best price for Olay Pro X - treatment works better than any department store brand I have tried - this is my POP (place of purchase and product of choice from now on---</li>
    <li> My mom like it very much and it worked maybe 20 days for the skin after you used itC feel goodiI&#x27;m sorry my English is not goodj</li>
    <li> Of course I was somewhat skeptic about the idea of a product that will help minimize and reduce wrinkles, but I am a believer now.  My husband gave me this kit for my 41st birthday...yes he gave it to me as a present.  Any other woman would of sent him to the doghouse but I actually asked for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried Avon Anew products but had a bad reaction to it.  My face swelled and felt numb.  Since then I have been using Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizer Lotion.  The allergic reaction with the Avon products made me hesitant to try new products.  Olay is now my preferred choice of skin products. The bottles are smaller than I expected but I carefully read the instructions and quickly started using them.  To my surprise, a little does go a long ways.  The cream glides on smoothly and effortlessly.  In the AM I first apply the ProX Deep Wrinkle Treatment to the crows feet near my eyes, the wrinkles on my forehead and smile/laugh lines around my mouth.  Then I apply the ProX Age Repair Lotion all over my face and neck.  In the PM before bed, I once again apply the ProX Deep Wrinkle Treatment around my eyes, forehead and smile lines, then apply the Wrinkle Smoothing Cream.  It leaves such a smooth silk feeling on my face.  My husband is always \\&quot;petting\\&quot; me now.  LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just after one week I can see dramatic results.  The crows feet are less noticeable and the wrinkles on my forehead are smoothing out.  The smile/laugh lines around my mouth have not really changed, but I truly believe with continuous use my face will appear 10 years younger in no time.  I have no no adverse reactions to the formulas and they have a clean refreshing scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband made the mistake of purchasing this kit from a well know retail chain and paid full price.  Amazon by far offers the Olay products for the best prices around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I t has been over a couple months and I can honestly say I see a dramatic difference.  My laugh lines around my mouth, crows feet and wrinkles on my forehead are about 75% less noticeable.  My face is younger looking and healthier, which overall gives me better self-esteem about my \\&quot;real\\&quot; age.on my forehead are about 75% less noticeable.  My face is younger looking and healthier, which overall gives me better self-esteem about my \\&quot;real\\&quot; age.</li>
    <li> This broke my face out.  I threw the packaging away, or I&#x27;d send it back</li>
    <li> The thinking that \\&quot;good\\&quot; skin care products have to cost hundreds of dollars is so old fashioned.  Yes, Oil of Olay has been around forever, but the old dog sure has learned some new tricks.  Lots of research and redevelopment has gone into their products and I have loved the Pro-X line.  Wasn&#x27;t really ready for parts of my face peeling, like my chin and between the brows, but it has sped up the cell turnover rate and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the fresh new skin being revealed.  I use the a.m. and the p.m. treatments and would recommend this to anyone who wants to see results.  My sister took the test on Olay.com and she started using the Definity line.  Try it- even if it&#x27;s not for you, you haven&#x27;t spent hundreds of dollars!</li>
    <li> I saw no improvement in my skin, I have been using this for a month now.&lt;br /&gt;Actually, I have red patches on my cheeks from it.&lt;br /&gt;Not happy with it!</li>
    <li> I have ordered this kit previously and feel that the lotion and  night cream are really working well.  So far as the Intensive wrinkle product in a small tube, well, I don&#x27;t know.  I&#x27;ve used it for 3 months and don&#x27;t notice any difference in the wrinkles on my forehead.  In the future, I would only order the lotion and night cream.</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past and I like it very much. It is not as harsh as retinol, but I feel it does the trick for older skin.</li>
    <li> After reading so many different opinions, I decided to give Olay Pro-X a try.  It is wonderful.  I could see a marked difference in the lines around my mouth and my whole face felt hydrated!  Very reasonable price for the results.</li>
    <li> I have tried most things out on the Market from Lancome to the Olay Regenerist, etc.  But this product is awesome. I live in Germany and the winters are really harsh. The moisturizer keeps my skin moist but the deep wrinkle product is AWESOME. I am 48 years old and many people tell me they think I&#x27;m 10 years younger. The crows feet and laugh lines are greatly reduced with the use of the product. The eye treatment really helps with the bags under my eyes and general crinkly skin I tend to get in the eye area.  I recommend you give this a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these items for several months now, it is a very nice moisturizing set with a great sunscreen.  I have a couple deep-ish wrinkles on my forehead along with some light crows feet lines starting around my eyes and using this often, keeps them at bay ... I&#x27;ve noticed that they have been noticably reduced, although they are still there.  It&#x27;s not a miracle cure to wrinkles by any means but it does keep my skin soft and supple and I would assume it keeps any damage from getting worse.  I have some sensitive areas on my face and this doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin in the least. I&#x27;ve repurchased these items, since they seem to work well for my needs &amp; would recommend them to anyone needing a little extra facial attention.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfy so far.....can feel my skin has great improvement!!</li>
    <li> I recived this last night and was excited to try it.  Literally, after two uses of the deep wrinkle treatment, the lines on my forehead have diminished.  I don&#x27;t know what else you can ask from a product than to work overnight.  The day lotion is light and absorbs quickly.  The night cream is rich without being overly thick and I didn&#x27;t have the dry look I normally do when I woke up.  I am anxious to see the results after one month.</li>
    <li> Received this almost two weeks ago.  I&#x27;ve notice my pores have gotten smaller.  Very happy so far with the results.</li>
    <li> Because of my skin, people are shocked to learn my real age.  At 61, I have very smooth skin.  I love all of the Olay products and especially this trio.</li>
    <li> I am a product junkie.  I try everything.  I bought Kinerase photo facials a few weeks ago. So thick and unpleasant. Olay glides on.  My skin feels so soft.  Just bought a second package for my beach house.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used \\&quot;OIL of OLAY\\&quot; products for many years, no complaints. My PRO-X kit works, not that I thought it would&#x27;nt. I can see a difference in the depth of the wrinkles, they are beginning to fill in.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help reduce the wrinkles around my eyes.  I haven&#x27;t seen a difference. I have used almost the entire tube of deep wrinkle treatment so far around my eyes. No change...</li>
    <li> I have used this kit for 4 months. I don&#x27;t see any difference in my skin or wrinkles. It is a nice moisturizer and feels good on my skin but this could be achieved by using a much less expensive product.</li>
    <li> I had seen it on the stores but found it here at a lower price.  It works great.  Check it out.</li>
    <li> I have been using Estee Lauder and didn&#x27;t like the way my skin looked. My skin looks much better with Olay.</li>
    <li> I have been using the professional line of Oil of Olay for several months now.  I look several months older, because several months have gone by.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I have been using other OOO products for years with acceptable results.  This one, however, delivers on its claims.  I am crediting the tiny little tube of Deep Wrinkle Treatment for making the difference between acceptable and remarkable.  I can see a real difference in the &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34; bumps under my eyes, a lessening of the crow&#x27;s feet lines, and a definite difference in the appearance of the 11 lines between my brows.  So, I will continue to use the other two products at night and during the day, but will be looking to order just the DWT (hopefully in a larger size)  as I&#x27;ve used more of that than the others combined.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect this product to get rid of deep wrinkles, but thought it would at least minimize the fine lines and perhaps improve skin texture.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month and see absolutely no difference in lines, fine or otherwise, or skin condition.  I found the products to be sticky and never left my face feeling soft.  My face is now starting to itch.  I had high hopes for this product to do at least some of the things it promised, but found no redeeming features.</li>
    <li> This stuff ruined my skin. Every morning I wake up hoping its just a terrible nightmare. Reality... People told me I looked great for my age but had a few lines on my face and decided to use Olay pro x to smooth them out. Few weeks later I had wrinkles and damaged skin around my eyes. Think twice about using this crap</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have real high expectations for this product...fully expected it to be like everything else and make promises it couldn&#x27;t keep.  But because I do like Olay products and the price was so reasonable, I figured it was worth trying.  I didn&#x27;t see immediate results.  It probably was 4-5 weeks into using it that I looked in the mirror one day and realized my skin had in fact changed.  It wasn&#x27;t a drastic change, but my skin seemed smoother and had more of a glow to it.  Then I started getting compliments.  I&#x27;ve bought a second kit for myself and my mom is now using it as well.  Totally worth trying.</li>
    <li> I love all the Olay products and you can&#x27;t beat the price. it retail for $49.95 at Walmart and that is the only other retailer where I have found the kit. It works and my skin continues to look younger with each application.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works.  I have been using this product for several months, as directed, and I can see a difference in the appearance of fine lines around the eyes, nose and mouth.  The day cream moisturizes well and makes your makeup go on smooth and keeps your skin dewy all day.  The night cream is also excellent.  Light in texture and moisturizes well.  Great products.</li>
    <li> I have not bee usin  feels great and I bevieve it will work I am going to order the eve treetmet</li>
    <li> I am so thrilled with this.  It&#x27;s only been 2 weeks and I&#x27;ve already seen such an improvement in my skin, it&#x27;s tighter, firmer, and best of all, smoother.  Not only is this working well on my wrinkles, but it has pretty much gotten rid of my adult acne, something I&#x27;ve been struggling with for years (I&#x27;m 43.)  In fact, I&#x27;m so happy with the results, that I actually look forward to washing my face even at night when I&#x27;m tired, because I can&#x27;t wait to see the results the next day.  It is definitely worth a try!  Return it if it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> It seems like you don&#x27;t get much product of the sunscreen and deep wrinkle cream. All of the creams make me oily and break out. Works good on my neck though since my neck doesn&#x27;t break out. The \\&quot;wrinkle smoothing cream\\&quot; is my favorite, it feels great going on and makes my skin feel good.</li>
    <li> The Olay Professional Pro-X Intensive Wrinkle kit is touted as various products to reduce the signs of significant aging.     I&#x27;m a few decades before the \\&quot;deep wrinkle\\&quot; category, but like other women my age, I&#x27;m interested in staving off the signs of the decrepitude to come, so I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to give this a try.    The three products work in tandem. You use the regimen twice daily: in the morning, the deep wrinkle cream \\&quot;on areas of concern,\\&quot; along with the age repair lotion on face and throat. In the evening, the deep wrinkle cream on those problem areas, and the wrinkle smoothing cream.    I will say after four weeks of this regimen, my skin did looking much clearer and softer. The deep wrinkle cream is some really nice stuff! Absorbs instantly and is non greasy. The age repair lotion (the AM stuff) was nice as well, but maybe the deep wrinkle treatment was overkill for me. I found it to be a little clogging, like just too much stuff on my skin. It just seemed to sit there, and make me very slippery.    I did notice an amazing clarity of my complexion. My pores seemed to be non-existent! It looked almost as if I had a luminscent lotion on my skin, but it was just me, bare-faced and without even moisturizer.    I&#x27;m not quite of the age to need this desperately, but I think using it a bit ahead of time is a good move. My aunt was so impressed she bought the kit herself (and she is at the \\&quot;deep wrinkle\\&quot; stage!)    Catch this when it&#x27;s on sale if you want to start an excellent face-preserving regimen.</li>
    <li> I researched facial care and wrinkle products for a year before I settled on Olay Regenerist products. They consistently got good reviews for actually working. When I saw this trial package, I thought it was a good buy.&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s a great buy! The night creme alone costs more than the whole package here.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to do a test to see if it really worked. For one week, I used the Olay on one half of my face only. I&#x27;m serious! Then I solicited opinions from friends. I reminded them it was ok to say they couldn&#x27;t tell, as that would save me money. To my surprise, 100% of them immediately picked the Olay side as having noticeably fewer lines.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a miracle. It won&#x27;t make you look 20 again. But for smoothing fine lines, it really does work. I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried - and I&#x27;ve used a lot. I love how light the night cream is, and it&#x27;s truly unscented. It doesn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; scent that a lot of products have.</li>
    <li> Good. I saw a difference within a week of use. However, I like Olay Pro-X&#x27;s Skin Tightening Serum and Hydra Firming Cream better. I really like the Age Repair Lotion with SPF 30 ... it is a great daily moisturizer with SPF. Yes, they are expensive, but cheaper on Amazon and you only need a small amount, so it lasts quite a while.</li>
    <li> Only 3 stars because the pump bottle does not work and I am unable to use it. Other than that, great product, great price and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This set is the second one Ive purchased.  Ive used Olay products for years and will continue to be a buyer of this kit.</li>
    <li> I guess I am one of those people who react to this product. After a couple of weeks of using it as directed, my skin started getting red, blotchy and irritated. I stopped using it and went to the dermatologist. He said that it is very common for people to have reactions to these types of skin products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched to Ponds and I don&#x27;t have issues anymore.</li>
    <li> perfect, I wanted to try Olay products, but I will go back to Nia 24</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t Waste your money.. No change in skin, made my skin dry and flaky.. gave it away...</li>
    <li> UPDATE:  AFTER USING THE PRODUCT FOR 3 MONTHS, I&#x27;ll update with this:  I still love the Pro X Intensive Wrinkle Kit with one caveat.  When I used this INSTEAD of the Olay Regenerist that I had been using previously, I saw that my wrinkles had improved, but sagging was more noticeable! Therefore I felt compelled to remove one star.  My new routine is to use the wonderful Intensive Repair Treatment (one of the items in the kit) where my wrinkles are prominent, and the Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Cream over all of my face (instead of the wrinkle cream in the kit).  I wish they had something that worked for both sagging and wrinkles in one product, but my current routine works quite well.  I&#x27;m still not a fan of the day cream in the kit because of its chemical smell due to the SPF - (but suggest you use it anyway if you are in the sun).  I&#x27;m still very glad that I tried the kit so I can see the pros and cons without spending a lot of money.  Oh, what we won&#x27;t do for youthful complexions... but with my 60th birthday this month, it&#x27;s well worth the effort!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW:  I&#x27;ve been a long time user of Olay Regenerist, and have been very pleased with it.  But time marches on, so I decided to give the Pro X a try.  This kit is the perfect way to do so, because you can try the products without a large investment.  Even though I have only used it for about 10 days, I decided to give a short-timers review and come back again after a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much to my surprise, I can see some softening of my forehead wrinkles even after just 10 days of use.  No, they didn&#x27;t disappear, of course, but they are not quite as noticeable.  The kit includes three items - a lotion for the morning, a cream for nighttime, and a wrinkle treatment to be used both day and night.  The lotion for the morning contains sunscreen and has a strong odor of such.  The night cream has a luxurious feel and glides over the skin so easily.  The wrinkle treatment has a fairly fine pointso that the product goes right into the wrinkles without any of it being wasted by extending onto non-wrinkled areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely fair skin, and am therefore never in the sun, so I rarely need to use sunscreen (and will add it as needed on the rare occasions that I will be outside,).  Therefore, I don&#x27;t plan to buy more of the day lotion, but will use the night cream both day and night.  Thus I can avoid the chemicals and the odor of the sunscreen when it isn&#x27;t needed.  The night cream and the wrinkle treatment I truly love, and plan to buy more when I run low.  And, as I already noted, I have seen a softening of my forehead wrinkles even though I have only been using this for 10 days.  I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing how much more the Pro X will do after I&#x27;ve been using it for a month or more</li>
    <li> I love the Pro X line.  I think it&#x27;s just as good as some of the more expensive lines I&#x27;ve tried.  I think it keeps your skin looking it&#x27;s best as you age.  Miracles don&#x27;t come in a jar, but this does help!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this kit for a bit over a month so maybe it needs more time to do its magic, but it&#x27;s not as great as I had hoped.  The eye cream is somewhat silky but it leaves a bit of a sheen in the eye area that I don&#x27;t like.  Im 33 and just trying to combat fine lines so I can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s made a huge difference for me...pretty much look the same.  The face cream is kind of pasty and not as smooth as others I have used but once I let it set I can use my Bare Minerals powder.  The night cream is decent and you don&#x27;t need to use too much.  I do like Olay products but might switch back to the Regenerist or Total Effects lines or just go back to Philosophy products.  I plan to finish using the set and decide but I guess overall I was expecting some miracle cream, which is my own fault!  The price on Amazon was much lower than anywhere else at the time I purchased, though, so that&#x27;s always a plus!</li>
    <li> I purchased three of these when they first came out, (three) because I wanted enough to be able to really see a change.  No change, not-a, nothing--Olay is suppose to be so great--not so much with this trio.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 5 yrs. now.  I have gotten so many compliment on my skin and how young I look.  I am 54yrs  old and don&#x27;t seem to have near the wrinkles women my age have.  Before this I used Olay Regenerist.  I have tried other products but have always come back to this product. (When will I learn)</li>
    <li> Great price and skin looks great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 40s and have very sensitive skin and rosacea.  I&#x27;ve been using these products, along with the Pro-X cleanser, for about three weeks and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  My skin is dewy (not oily), the fine lines are softened, and the redness in my cheeks is almost gone.  The products are easy to use and no more expensive than any other similar regime.</li>
    <li> This is a gift for my Mom. She likes this brand very much. And it&#x27;s super cheap than other market.  I am not sure about the effect but i trust Olay.</li>
    <li> I have used this product faithfully for about 75 days.  I find it to be more work than I want to do twice a day and see no difference.  I&#x27;ll go back to Philosophy.  I don&#x27;t think the Philosophy reduced wrinkles either, but I enjoy those products more.</li>
    <li> Why must limit the number of words, my English is not very good!&lt;br /&gt;Why must limit the number of words, my English is not very good!</li>
    <li> not a bad price just dont care for the product its not for me i think if this is what you my like i would say try it</li>
    <li> So far I like the products but still waiting for the results.</li>
    <li> Wife purchased it.  Works great.</li>
    <li> Great price for good skin regimen</li>
    <li> Olay never lets me down, its a great cream</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for over 5 years and I works great. I choose to buy it at Amazon because of the price.</li>
    <li> You save a few bucks purchasing this here versus the pharmacy. Olay has some of the best anti-aging products on the market.</li>
    <li> For me Pro-X is too much for my normal to oily skin.  The Deep Wrinkle Treatment tube is probably the most beneficial.  I still like the Regenerist Elixer - more effective for my skin that Pro-X.</li>
    <li> I was not sure if this was going to be another waste of my money and time. I have purchased so many products in the past only to have them fail, but I am thrilled with these products. My daughter is so impressed, she is now a user of them also.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I noticed a difference in skin clarity and texture after 1 month, and it has continued to improve to about 3 mos.  I was unable to use retinoic acid (prescription) during my pregnancy, but this was a nice substitute and one that I continue to use postpartum.</li>
    <li> It really works, I have been using it for over a month and results are great. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say that it makes a lot of difference for my wrinkles since I&#x27;m only 32 and dont have all that many.  I bought it more as a preventative measure, and to smooth out some of those fine lines.  I do really like it though.  The little jar of night cream is my favorite. It makes my skin so smooth.  I could swear my forehead lines are looking smoother.  They certainly feel nice to the touch.  Nice and silky.  I like the SPF day cream also.  It feels a little heavier than the 15 SPF cream I had from este lauder, but it IS a 30 SPF.  Which I feel better about.  My skin doesnt break out from it like many other creams can do for me so I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have been using the olay system for 4 years now.  I am 33, stay active, drink plenty of water.  Many people think that I am still 24, I did go a few months once without the cream and my age was starting to show, with crows feet and forehead wrinkles.  I think this cream is great, but I would not use it alone, combine it with tons of water, vegetables, and meditation.</li>
    <li> great products and great service</li>
    <li> First of all, I am biased. I really like just about all of the Olay Skin Care Line Products. This ProX line is no exception.  Olay has gone well beyond the old Oil of Olay of yesteryear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I would not characterize my skin type as super sensitive, I will always do a \\&quot;Patch Test\\&quot; on my forearm underside first. And if no rash, breakout, or other untoward effect after about 24-48 hours, I will then apply to my face. I certainly do not want to have swollen eyes and major allergies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can report that this cream is well tolerated and did not promote rashes, swelling, comedones (a.k.a. pimples). Also no facial discoloration- (red, pink,  brown, yellow, or pale.........)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream has a nice rich-yet light and non-greasy-texture.  The scent is fresh, light, and not over-powering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream goes on evenly and is well absorbed. A little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The skin feels fresh, smooth,  and tighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having good skin is all about maintenance. I do not believe there are any miracles--yet.  Though who know what tomorrow will bring?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically-Don&#x27;t Smoke (!) if you want to have&lt;br /&gt; good skin. Eat right, avoid excess greasy foods.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recently really been paying attention to sodium consumption and since dramatically reducing Sodium intake over the past 2-3 months, I have noticed my face just looks better-and younger. Could the Fountain of Youth be limiting Sodium intake to less than 900 mg a day (as is recommended in Australia? ) The American college of Cardiology is pushing sodium intake to about 1500 mg a day or less. Current US recommendations are about 2500 mg daily. Sadly, on average, Americans take in about 4500 mg a day. Way too much.  That amount is going to damage a lot of things in our body, promote kidney stones, heart disease, high blood pressure, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And our skin is going to be ravaged also by excess sodium intake!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So-cut the sodium, don&#x27;t smoke, don&#x27;t drink too much alcohol (dries you out like a prune), get exercise, plenty of sleep (probably sleep on a pillow, slightly elevated head-no point in having gravity do you in, either), eat right-Fruits and vegetables , kids!)  Limit fats also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and make faces!  Yes, it&#x27;s good for a laugh, but also exercises the myriad of muscles in our face and gets the blood flowing!  It is postulated that men have less wrinkles (not just due to Testosterone), because they shave and grimace, puff out cheeks, etc.........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all that said about maintenance, it is important to have an excellent moisturizing cream with SPF during the day (even cloudy days-solar energy is radiation-want that on your face??  (ZZZZAP!))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Higher priced skin products (La Prairie, etc) have NOT won any awards.  Their Skin Care lines (Regenerist, Definity, Pro-X) have all fared very well against much higher priced competitors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Housekeeping 2010:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Olay Pro-X Eye Restoration Complex ($42, amazon.com or drugstore.com) ranked highest in the lab and proved to be a standout hydrator, according to the Corneometer moisture study. Visual analysis also showed Olay to be one of the top performers in undereye crinkles, though the results were modest. Consumers noted that the cream reduced their crow&#x27;s-feet, puffiness, and undereye bags. Several liked the nonirritating, soothing properties as well. \\&quot;It felt nice going on, moisturized my skin, and was very gentle,\\&quot; reported one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The contenders: Treatments promising to improve signs of aging around the eyes, including dryness, crow&#x27;s-feet, fine lines, puffiness, dark circles, and sagging lids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Testing time: Eight weeks.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How To Use This Cream:  Wash face gently. Remove makeup.  Apply gently to face morning and at bedtime (essentially twice a day).  After months of use, there is a definite improvement!  So, it is not just money down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downside?  There are cheaper alternatives, Amazon&#x27;s price is very good, possibly the best.  No other downsides come to mind. Just don&#x27;t expect a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a terrific face cream.atives, Amazon&#x27;s price is very good, possibly the best.  No other downsides come to mind. Just don&#x27;t expect a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a terrific face cream.</li>
    <li> First off, I&#x27;m not looking for reviews from ladies in the 30-40 year old age range! This is serious business! Lol What is important to me are reviews that target MY age group...65+. I&#x27;ve been wanting to try the pro-x line, and the price was more reasonable from the seller that was available when I purchased this. Delivery was timely and the price was good. Product appears new, but the label was handwritten, there was no packing material and the box did not look in new condition. I look forward to seeing how this works!</li>
    <li> I likeds the wrinle cream an the wrinkle repair.  I was allergic to the SPF in the day lotion.  No, I won&#x27;t be repurchasing this product, I will stick with my other olay products.</li>
    <li> I love the Olay Pro-X line, and have been using it for about 2 years now. They work quite well and keep my skin moisturized. I absolutely love the Deep Wrinkle Cream!! It has a nice fragrance, and isn&#x27;t greasy or oily. Some people mentioned breaking out when using the Olay Pro-X line, but I have not experienced that at all. It&#x27;s a terrific kit!</li>
    <li> The size of the items in the kit is pretty small but good for travel.  This is pricey stuff but amazon has the best prices anywhere.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any visible positive results from using this product.  I like that the night cream is rich and creamy, and penetrates into the skin. My face feels moisturized, which is always a good thing.  However, this is no miracle cure for wrinkles, but I&#x27;ll keep searching.</li>
    <li> Product arrived at estimated time but was not in an acceptable condition packaging wise , but I was blown away by the fast and swift customer service I received when I complained about my product...... I ended throwing the product away, but i was refunded immediately, so as companies go, I think these guys are excellent. I decided to buy the product from my neighborhood Walgreens.</li>
    <li> Very well pleased with this product...not greasy like some of the other brands.</li>
    <li> My face loves Olay! I&#x27;m 51 and my face feels and looks younger.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and does exactly what it says it is going to do. It clarifies my skin and minimizes fine lines and gives my skin a healthy glow. I have found the deep wrinkle treatment has improved my skins apprearance around my eyes and on my forehead too. I have used this product for over a year and from the beginning to now, I have seen a marked improvement in how my skin looks. 45 is not so scary when your skin looks healthy!</li>
    <li> I loved using these products. I saw results after just using for one week.</li>
    <li> I love this product vs Clinique&#x27;s anti-wrinkle products. It leaves my face feeling soft and not greasy looking.  I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Olay Professional Pro-X Intensive Wrinkle Protocol 1 Kit is wonderful.  I use it everyday and I could see the differents in my face.  I love it, my only wish is if  it were cheaper in price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this when I first wanted to try the Pro-X line.  It was a good way to try a new product without committing to a large bottle/jar/tube of something I might not want to use past the first week or two.  As it turned out, I really liked the day lotion, but wasn&#x27;t overly impressed with the wrinkle smoothing cream or the deep wrinkle cream, so I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t invest a lot of money in larger versions of those two products.</li>
    <li> this stuff is not worth the money its just a lotion does not help wrinkles sad for being a olay prouduct ,,also will cause your face to break out after use of 5-7 days beware</li>
    <li> It speaks for iteself.  My Great-Grandmother used Oil of Olay well into her 90&#x27;s and I can only hope it does for my skin what it did for hers!</li>
    <li> Olay&#x27;s Pro-X line of products really meets consumer expectations. Maybe it just improves the appearance; as opposed to permanently changing any underlying issues, but I am satisfied and the intensive wrinkle cream really DOES instantly work. I like the day cream w/30 SPF too.</li>
    <li> paquete completo recomendado</li>
    <li> I bought it used which I thought was pretty disgusting imagining that a stranger put their finger in it whether or not they washed their hands. I gave this product to my mom so I&#x27;m thinking it did some justice considering the fact that her laugh lines are diminished a little</li>
    <li> i gotta tell you i have noticed improvement with my &amp;#34;beauty lines&amp;#34; when i use this product along with my new derma roller.  i gave this to my sister also and we both notice a difference.  worth the investment!!</li>
    <li> This Olay cream Is really great it works best all the time, I have used many different brands but none stands against Olay.</li>
    <li> Definitely not as advertised.  I noticed no change at all, and I was religious about using it.</li>
    <li> I was using Mary Kay but it just wasn&#x27;t getting the results I wanted. I saw this, decided to try it and I LOVE it!  I&#x27;ve had no skin reactions as other reviewers mention and after 2 months, I&#x27;m seeing an improvement!  The only product I added was the Olay Pro Eye Creme!  Great deal on Amazon.com for all!</li>
    <li> Clean and light with satisfying results. I think the regenerist products do the same thing for less price. This is a great kit to try the product in smaller sizes.</li>
    <li> I like all olay products...so not disappointed</li>
    <li> I bought this for travel.  Size is great but the lotion was either empty or pump broken.  Grrrr.  Already threw away packaging!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this everyday as suggested and I see no difference.</li>
    <li> I bought this and it arrived early. It is an excellent deal -60 percent less than Wal mart. very nice</li>
    <li> i use this everyday. makes my face feel clean and fresh. doesnt feel greasy at all. great olay products  .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Olay&#x27;s facial moisturizer (the original light pink version), for years, and have done so because it was my Mother&#x27;s moisturizer of choice and she had fabulous skin.  I did see a small improvement with fine lines over the period of time I used it, but the amount of improvement just did not justify the cost for me. Still, I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
