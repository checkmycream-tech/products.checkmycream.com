    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cleanser for two years now. It&#x27;s by far better than anything I&#x27;ve tried- and I&#x27;ve used the pink Cadillac products, the white Mercedes Benz products and this is one step to perfect skin. My son who&#x27;s going on 12 sometimes gets minor break outs and a little cleanser on at night before bed and he wakes up in the morning - with tiny blemishes instead of big ones if any at all. I highly recommend it, don&#x27;t pay too much though. I&#x27;ve paid over $70 for this same bottle (I&#x27;d still say it was worth it). That&#x27;s why I wrote the review too, this price is excellent. It&#x27;s a little hard to get used to just rubbing on the cleanser and not having to rinse it off but it really does clean your skin and balances the ph perfectly. People think I have a very nice complexion - I&#x27;m 48 - but they don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d look like if I didn&#x27;t use this product. BUY IT! IT&#x27;S AWESOME!</li>
    <li> I had very bad problems with acne for years.  In my early twenties, it was somewhat better, but still problematic.  A woman in the mall stopped me and recommended this cleanser.  Ever since I started using it, my skin cleared right up.  Always rinse with cold water - it helps your pores to shrink up so that your clean face doesn&#x27;t start absorbing pollutants in the air right after you wash.</li>
    <li> This is good product for me to use in Malaysia even four season country when i was travel ...now i am using the second bottle in the 4 months time... but please improve the bottle of this product , it easy to leaking ...very bad design of the bottle and the pump .</li>
    <li> love this product, it is the best for me and me daughter, banish acne, cleanse makeup, soften skin, tend wrinkles...love this product.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely cleanser&lt;br /&gt;Smooth creamy and it works&lt;br /&gt;Makes my skin feel great before bed&lt;br /&gt;Thank you fir the prompt delivery to New Zealand</li>
    <li> I have used this product before, can&#x27;t always find it. Happy that I did. Leaves your skin feeling very soft.</li>
    <li> Most gentle of any cleanser I have ever used and takes ALL makeup of including mascara.</li>
    <li> overall a usable product. My wife&#x27;s skin is super sensitive. She approved this product, so I would recommend it for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I live the way it feels, smooth and creamy.  I have fairly dry skin and it leaves my face feeling great.</li>
    <li> Love it, makes my skin feel clean and soft.</li>
    <li> Received this product in perfect condition !&lt;br /&gt;The feeling of using this product is great. Skin is smooth &amp; silky , like a baby touch .</li>
    <li> This product moisturizes as it cleans and leaves my skin very comfortable without causing skin irritations or break outs. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 10 years. It helped clear my adult acne.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It makes my face soft! It is so creamy and moisturizing! I love it so much! Thanks a million!</li>
    <li> This is a really nice cleanser for my aging face.  I like the feel it gives me after I use it.  My face feels soft and cleaned.</li>
    <li> So far I have continued to use this on my face and neck along with the toner. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be causing any problems for me. It leaves a strange feeling initially, almost like it doesn&#x27;t feel like it rinses off.</li>
    <li> This is the best!!! I use it for a moisturizer and cleanser I will buy more that all I have</li>
    <li> I love this product, creamy and it feels sooooo good.  Keeps the skin feeling soft, never dry.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a year, there&#x27;s nothing like the milky cleaning feeling .&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The milk cleanser leaves my skin feeling moist and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.&lt;br /&gt;I can really tell the difference when I do not use this cleanser.</li>
    <li> Being a woman of a certain age, I find most cleansers are just too drying.&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser I massage into my skin to loosen up the dirt and makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I then have a few different ways to proceed depending on the amount of time&lt;br /&gt;I have and my mood.&lt;br /&gt;I can jump in the shower and rinse it off .&lt;br /&gt;I can use a wet cloth and wipe it off at the sink.&lt;br /&gt;I can us a dry tissue and wipe it off in my bedroom at my dresser.&lt;br /&gt;I then follow up with a toner and I&#x27;m good to go. My skinis supple enough that I&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t have to use a moisturizer - although most of the time I do BUT it is nice not&lt;br /&gt;to HAVE to.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for years and haven&#x27;t found anything better to replace it.</li>
    <li> My skin feels wonderful and has a healthy dewy look.</li>
