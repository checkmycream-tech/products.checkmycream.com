      <li>I have been tanning for a couple months and already had a good color but wanted to achieve a darker tan.</li>
      <li>Just to be clear,I dont think there&#x27;s a lotion out there that smells good after tanning!&lt;br</li>
      <li>It gave me a super tingle and great color after just one use!</li>

      <li>I was so excited to try this lotion after reading all the good reviews.</li>
      <li>The first time I used mood I was very pleased, however after a couple of uses I noticed my skin was drying out and the color washes off when you shower!</li>

      <li>Love this stuff</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s one of my favorite tanning lotions.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite tanning lotion of all time.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many indoor tingle tanning lotions that have worked well</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for two weeks and am already searching for something better....</li>
      <li>Make sure you can go home and shower</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this lotion.  </li>
      <li>Again, I love love love this product.</li>
      <li>I have shared it with friends who also say they love the feeling of the sizzle up to 3 hours after applying it.</li>
      <li>Mood has always been one of my favorite tanning lotions.  </li>
      <li>You see phenomenal results immediately.  </li>
      <li>My skin is more used to it</li>
      <li>I really love it.    </li>
      <li>i love it,dont drop it</li>
      <li>Life is just better with Mood.</li>
      <li>Ok I&#x27;m just gonna tell it like it is.</li>
      <li>I wasnt sure which one to try</li>
      <li>It tingled a LOT when I first got in the tanning bed, and the tingle lasted a good 3.5 hours after use, but I must say, it gave me the deepest tan I&#x27;ve gotten in one visit.</li>
      <li>have been tanning for over 20 years, I also tan really easily.</li>
      <li>At first I really liked it but after 2-3 weeks my Tan reached its plateau.</li>
      <li>an u will be fine.</li>
      <li>Does make you look super burnt after using!</li>
      <li>It gives a great dynamic tan that lasts.  </li>
      <li>but it will bring out the best tan if you have a good base and want to make it even better!</li>
      <li>I normally read rather than post, but I wanted to say that the MOOD lotion is amazing.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
      <li>I originally bought this lotion in a tanning salon for over $60.</li>
      <li>It works great as long as u can leave it on awhile.  </li>
      <li>I use this lotion and I can significantly notice a difference.&lt;br /&gt;****It</li>
      <li>If you enjoy the super tingling feeling of tanning lotion...</li>
      <li>My favorite indoor taaning lotions are made by Designer Skin, but this is the 1st time that I was really dissapointed it just didn&#x27;t do what it said it did or</li>
      <li>Well, i have been using it for about a month now and was expecting a really great sizzle like other reviewers posted.</li>
      <li>Seller was quick and efficient.  </li>
      <li>It has a super hot tingle.  </li>
      <li>and he got a rash right away.</li>
      <li>right</li>
      <li>The tingle is super intense.  </li>
      <li>Would recommend this lotion to get brown fast!</li>
      <li>i love this lotion,the only issue is every time i buy one i drop it somehow</li>
      <li>Sometimes you wont feel it tingle/feel hot until 20 mins after you tan.</li>
      <li>It has a good smell (not terrible and not awesome).</li>
      <li>I said, I try a lot of different products, many are easier to handle than Mood, but few give the same great results.  </li>
      <li>It really helped me achieve a darker color.</li>
      <li>I needed some fast, as I was running out of lotion.  </li>
      <li>I spent over 65 dollars buying it at the tanning salon, so I&#x27;m glad I found that it&#x27;s sold online.    </li>
      <li>I have used this product before from a normal tanning salon first time trying it here</li>
      <li>What you are left with is bronzed, silky smooth skin.  </li>
      <li>but I was really looking forward to the maximum tingle it claimed to have.</li>
      <li>but that didn&#x27;t bother me so much.</li>
      <li>I love this lotion, I&#x27;m a big fan of tingle (sizzle) lotions and this one delivers great dark color in just a few uses!</li>
      <li>Tingle is hot, but not too hot, definitely test an area if your not use to using tingles.</li>
      <li>I have not yet had the tingle that it claims it has even in high pressure beds.</li>
      <li>high in the salon</li>
      <li>I am a tanning bed \\&quot;junkie\\&quot; and I highly recommend Mood over anything else.</li>
      <li>Mode is &amp;#34;My all time favorite&amp;#34; thus far!!</li>
      <li>and the top of bottle with the cover breaks off its so bottom heavy</li>
      <li>way cheaper than when I bought it in the salon/ I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a few months, still love it</li>
      <li>The tingling is very sensational and it has done a mediocre job at keeping my tan lasting a week or two.</li>
      <li>For me the tingle is tolerable but for new tanners or those with sensitive skin</li>
      <li>It is completely normal and your skin should go back to normal</li>
      <li>its always gotten me super dark</li>
      <li>Like always after trying a new product I went back to Mood.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many indoor tingle tanning lotions that have worked well but Mood seems to work the best for me. I recently bought Bombshell 300x after I tried a sample. At first I really liked it but after 2-3 weeks my Tan reached its plateau. Like always after trying a new product I went back to Mood. For me the tingle is tolerable but for new tanners or those with sensitive skin I Would Not suggest trying it! Mood seems to get me darker without leveling out. The  bronzer doesnt streak or bleed nearly as bad as other lotions and the smell is tolerable. Just to be clear,I dont think there&#x27;s a lotion out there that smells good after tanning!&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Mode is &amp;#34;My all time favorite&amp;#34; thus far!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product before from a normal tanning salon first time trying it here but it gave me a really bad rash not sure if it is just not a pure product.</li>
    <li> I have always wanted to try this product but the cost was too. high in the salon so it was a lot cheaper here so i bought it though Amazon. Well, i have been using it for about a month now and was expecting a really great sizzle like other reviewers posted. I have not yet had the tingle that it claims it has even in high pressure beds. One thing i can say it does make me a little tan but nothing to noticable. Been tanning for a few months now and need something stronger than mood lotion. Bronzers just dont work on me. Not gonna buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I normally read rather than post, but I wanted to say that the MOOD lotion is amazing. It tingled a LOT when I first got in the tanning bed, and the tingle lasted a good 3.5 hours after use, but I must say, it gave me the deepest tan I&#x27;ve gotten in one visit. I really love it.    It also kept me moisturized and the smell is AWESOME. I spent over 65 dollars buying it at the tanning salon, so I&#x27;m glad I found that it&#x27;s sold online.    Buy it and give it a try, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this lotion after reading all the good reviews. I have been tanning for a couple months and already had a good color but wanted to achieve a darker tan. The first time I used mood I was very pleased, however after a couple of uses I noticed my skin was drying out and the color washes off when you shower! I have been using this product for two weeks and am already searching for something better....</li>
    <li> It took me so long to pick which tingle lotion I wanted to try and ended up purchasing Mood. Disappointment is an understatement. No tingle sensation or even skin redness what&#x27;s so ever. It does smell very very good but I was really looking forward to the maximum tingle it claimed to have. I will not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of tanning lotions over the years, and I always seem to come back to Mood.  It gives a great dynamic tan that lasts.  But Mood will kick your butt.  The tingle is super intense.  I&#x27;m an experienced tanner, I don&#x27;t burn, and Mood gets to me every time.  I feel itchy right after use and have some redness for a little while.  However, my sister doesn&#x27;t seem to have those same effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I try a lot of different products, many are easier to handle than Mood, but few give the same great results.  I will definitely continue to rotate Mood into my routine, and if you&#x27;re looking to take your tan to the next level,  you should give it a try.  But you have been warned.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion.  It sure does tingle, but the annoying sizzle goes away after a couple of hours.  What you are left with is bronzed, silky smooth skin.  After just a couple uses I was able to break my tanning plateau!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mood off and on for the last 7 years. It&#x27;s one of my favorite tanning lotions. I always see results when I use it and I like the smell of it before, though afterwards it leaves a weird burnt smell. I would have to agree with on of the other reviews on here, this is highly dangerous for children and anyone with sensitive skin. I have tanned with this, washed my hands and face/neck afterwards then held my toddler&#x27;s hand and he got a rash right away. Make sure you can go home and shower right afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve paid $50 for this in a tanning salon, so $30 with shipping is not too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with my buy, will buy again when I run out!</li>
    <li> I originally bought this lotion in a tanning salon for over $60. I would recommend buying it here on amazon! It really helped me achieve a darker color. After awhile when I tan, I stop seeing results and I feel like I didn&#x27;t get anything. I use this lotion and I can significantly notice a difference.&lt;br /&gt;****It does tingle, so if you aren&#x27;t used to that, just a FYI. My skin is more used to it and it doesn&#x27;t bother me. Sometimes you wont feel it tingle/feel hot until 20 mins after you tan. It is completely normal and your skin should go back to normal afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;Just because it is not a new lotion, you should not ignore MOOD! Have used it since 2008 and would recommend it over some of the newer lotions.</li>
    <li> Good product - delivers excellent bronze tan.     PLEASE PLEASE read the warnings about rubbing off on children. I touched my granddaughter AFTER I rinsed off and she developed red patches and itchy skin that made her cry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mood for several years now. I switch it out w/ another lotion or 2 also by Designer skin. They make great lotions! This one also has a great sizzle so be ready!</li>
    <li> this product smells great you do not finish tanning and have that nasty tanning smell so u can actually sto by the store afterwards if need to and not feel like you stink</li>
    <li> way cheaper than when I bought it in the salon/ I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a few months, still love it</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, I&#x27;m a big fan of tingle (sizzle) lotions and this one delivers great dark color in just a few uses! Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> If you enjoy the super tingling feeling of tanning lotion... then this is a good fit for you!  I was not sure of how I was going to like this being I purchased it before I ever tested it, but I LOVE IT!  It has a good smell (not terrible and not awesome). The tingling is very sensational and it has done a mediocre job at keeping my tan lasting a week or two.</li>
    <li> Great lotion I&#x27;ve been using for years now. Men can&#x27;t stay away from me and I have tons of fans. Life is just better with Mood.</li>
    <li> My bottles were broke both times had holes in them</li>
    <li> As we all know, tanning bed lotions are a \\&quot;must have\\&quot; in order to get the best results. Lotions are expensive and you really take a chance on a product if you have never used it before.  You have nothing to worry about with Designer Skin Mood.  It is the best product I have used.  You see phenomenal results immediately.  I am a tanning bed \\&quot;junkie\\&quot; and I highly recommend Mood over anything else.</li>
    <li> this lotion smells great and has a great tingle to it.Is for more advanced tanner but a great value for the price.</li>
    <li> LOVED IT! Tingle worked great and the smell was awesome. Got me dark after 3 or 4 tanning sessions! Does make you look super burnt after using! But as most experienced tingle lotion users know....it is supposed to happen</li>
    <li> I tried Mood Maximum Sizzle Quadruple Bronzer Tanning Lotion about 5 years back. I love it. I&#x27;ve tried other tingle and sizzle lotions and none of them gives the color that Mood does. I have shared it with friends who also say they love the feeling of the sizzle up to 3 hours after applying it. It&#x27;s not for sissy&#x27;s, and I definitely would not use it if I had small children that need to be held. Again, I love love love this product.</li>
    <li> mood is one of my fav tanning lotions .ive used this product for over three yr&#x27;s now with great results and a great looking tan and soft skin.you can never go wrong with this product or with this price on amazon .com</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion for years, and it&#x27;s never let me down. Great bronzer, and moisturizers!!! Tingle is hot, but not too hot, definitely test an area if your not use to using tingles. I think it&#x27;s a great one to start out with. All around a great lotion!!!</li>
    <li> My favorite indoor taaning lotions are made by Designer Skin, but this is the 1st time that I was really dissapointed it just didn&#x27;t do what it said it did or what I expected from Designer Skin. I would skip this one and try, Goddess or Bombshell or just about any other one.</li>
    <li> Not for the beginner unless you are all ready dark.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this for years (although I alternate between lotions every time I go as to not hit a plateau with any of them). I love this stuff! its always gotten me super dark and Ive always used tingle lotion, this stuff works for me every time. The after tan smell is also much nicer than any of my other lotions (Ive had multiple people actually ask me what perfume I&#x27;m wearing...weird right?!) If you like tingle I would definitely recommend this and its also an older lotion, so I would recommend buying from amazon or online, as the salons usually mark up the price (e.g. $60 at my salon, $25 here). Would recommend this lotion to get brown fast!</li>
    <li> The product seems to work.  I was a little taken back, with the tingling and the redness you get.&lt;br /&gt;I have been tanning for over 20 years, I also tan really easily. When I used this product I already had a dark tan.&lt;br /&gt;I turned really red from the product, and of course the tingle but that didn&#x27;t bother me so much. But the redness I did not like and it lasted about an hour.</li>
    <li> Mood has always been one of my favorite tanning lotions.  I needed some fast, as I was running out of lotion.  Seller was quick and efficient.  I got my shipment within a few days and I&#x27;m good to go!  Will definitely purchase from this seller again!!!</li>
    <li> Ok I&#x27;m just gonna tell it like it is. This stuff definitely works if u can handle the heat. It has a super hot tingle.  I&#x27;ve used other tingle products but haven&#x27;t found any that get me as dark as mood. A friend of mine told me its her go to tanning lotion so I gave it a try. It works great as long as u can leave it on awhile.  Don&#x27;t wash off for awhile and remember you have it on because it will rub off on other people you touch.</li>
    <li> I am very very happy with this brand! I wasnt sure which one to try but this is an awesome product. It gave me a super tingle and great color after just one use! Smells great and works well!</li>
    <li> i love this lotion,the only issue is every time i buy one i drop it somehow and the top of bottle with the cover breaks off its so bottom heavy it just breaks,so then i have to get it out of bottle an put it in something else,its a pain in a*&amp;*$# so please fix that issue.but i love it,dont drop it an u will be fine.</li>
    <li> Mood. One of my favorite tanning lotion of all time. With the tingle and bronzer in it you can&#x27;t beat it. Mood and bombshell too best tanning lotions you can get with tingle in it! Love this stuff</li>
    <li> Have used this product before. Was paying over double at the tanning salon for it. Awesome product!!!!! Bought two, will buy again every time.</li>
    <li> This lotion works great but I would recommend a base tan! It&#x27;s not for amateurs, it has a tingle to it but it will bring out the best tan if you have a good base and want to make it even better!</li>
