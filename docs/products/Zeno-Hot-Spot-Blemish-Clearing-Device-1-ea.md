### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>And that was great!  </li>
      <li>Technology is a wonderful thing.</li>
      <li>I had read all the great reviews on this product, and as I don&#x27;t have acne everywhere</li>
      <li>but it works amazing!</li>
      <li>but a couple of days compared to weeks to get a zit to disappear is truly remarkable .I</li>
      <li>This adorable compact pimple gizmo works great!</li>
      <li>but when I do, its good to have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But, if you use this product when you feel a pimple coming on, it works amazingly.  </li>
      <li>I think it depends on the kind of pimple and where it is on your face.    </li>
      <li>It has a nice, warm tingly feeling too.  </li>
      <li>Besides the fact that it works just as well, it is more compact (you can discreetly take it anywhere), it has more lives, and it is cheaper!  </li>
      <li>I was RIGHT!!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not an overnight cure, but it does help stubborn zits heal up pretty quickly and best of all</li>
      <li>It seems like a very cheap device.</li>
      <li>I just got this thing tonight, and have done two cycles (waiting the appropriate 5 hours)</li>
      <li>and I found I like this one even better.  </li>
      <li>It costs $0.89 per use, and most pimples need 2 or 3 uses to go away.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t get that many breakouts</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure others are defective as well.</li>
      <li>It has been a life saver many times.</li>
      <li>I am supposed to get way more than three uses out of this.</li>
      <li>Such a wonderful idea!  </li>
      <li>I just tried this gadget for the first time and it is everything I hoped it would be and more!  </li>
      <li>It is easy to use, lightweight, heats up fast and of course still performs as good as the original model.  </li>
      <li>This new Zeno is a great price and it works just as effectively as the older model in getting rid of beginning pimples.</li>
      <li>Not only is this thing adorable, but it works AMAZINGLY!</li>
      <li>, I figured it would be perfect for the occasional (LARGE) blemish I get.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the original ZENO for years, and I&#x27;ve had great success with the disappearance of pimples that are newly forming.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean with a moist cloth.</li>
      <li>To be honest, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much and</li>
      <li>I am always researching products for my light acne.</li>
      <li>The replacement cartridges are still widely available online and in stores.  </li>
      <li>Thank you to those reviewers out there that gave us support and useful advice!</li>
      <li>so i can clean the gunk out.</li>
      <li>and you treat it right away!</li>
      <li>The Zeno Hot Spot is a wonderful little gadget...  </li>
      <li>But many times, I did not notice a real difference.</li>
      <li>I bought mine for travel about six months ago because I had such good results with the rechargeable model.</li>
      <li>I love love love the zeno hot spot because its so tiny!</li>
      <li>I get the normal hormonal kind but a deep cystic kind too.</li>
      <li>This was not an ideal situation for a Zeno as it was a massive blemish by the time it was treated and over a week old.  </li>
      <li>mild acne:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>the Zeno has helped my existing blemishes tremendously.     </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s what led me to investigate about Zeno, and buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have mild acne (white-heads, pustules)</li>
      <li>I bought my Zeno Hot Spot in a store this week in an effort to battle a HUGE pimple on my chin.  </li>
      <li>CHEAPER is my favorite part, besides the fact that I have clear skin because of it!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend that you try this product, you will be amazed and suprised yourself!!!</li>
      <li>I know that I am always skeptical about the chemicals that you put on your face and if it is good for you, but the beautiful thing about this is that there are no harsh chemicals and it works!!!  </li>
      <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
      <li>The swelling and raised white area was completely gone, though, and I was happy about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So whether or not it&#x27;s the reason for my success</li>
      <li>I decided to try this new model HOT SPOT, and I love it.  </li>
      <li>However it is still available online from amazon and many other retailers.</li>
      <li>You feel the first zing of a pimple before it comes popping out</li>
      <li>There are definitely a lot more smiles around our house now.</li>
      <li>At first it worked, not as well as I thought it would.</li>
      <li>I first wash my face and make sure it&#x27;s completely dry.</li>
      <li>I read other reviews which said the Zeno wouldn&#x27;t help with these types of blemishes, but I&#x27;ve noticed they are healing much faster with use of the Zeno than they would normally on their own.</li>
      <li>They get all red and huge and eventually come to a head</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s gentle on your skin.</li>
      <li>You have to be patient to wait a few minutes holding it over your pimple, and afterward, it leaves a temporary red area in the treated spot, so it&#x27;s best to do it at night when you&#x27;re not going out in public.</li>
      <li>I really like the Zeno and it works for my skin.</li>
      <li>Upon using this product, I was a real skeptic.  </li>
      <li>It works very well after one use</li>
      <li>When you have a special day or just dont want to walk around with a zit on your face (or back, or chest...)</li>
      <li>Not even replacable tips, like the older models.  </li>
      <li>Zeno&#x27;s website says they are planning to discontinue the Zeno classic, Zeno Pro and Zeno MD (all of which use a rechargable battery and use replacement tips which will still be sold Zeno says.</li>
      <li>I gave this 4 stars mainly for that reason.</li>
      <li>I should also say that I did a variety of other things to combat this thing on the same day I did 2 Zeno treatments (warm compresses, Neosporin, etc).  </li>
      <li>I experienced a pretty bad breakout along my jawline from a prescription medication and picked up the Zeno Hot Spot to see if it would help out.</li>
      <li>always clean my Zeno after using it, just by using a dry tissue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>After 80 uses, you have to go out and buy a new one.</li>
      <li>Therefore, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product unless you want to pay for a new one every couple of months.</li>
      <li>You just zap your new zit a couple times, 3 to 4 hours apart and</li>
      <li>After owning the rechargeable  model,  I bought this new one sometime in March</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m definitely going to upgrade to the Zeno when my Hot Spot runs out.</li>
      <li>The website does not tell you that there are only 80 uses in the Zeno Hot Spot.</li>
      <li>WOW!</li>
      <li>I just followed the simple directions and it did exactly what it said it would do.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this for my teenage daughter because of the positive reviews.</li>
      <li>The hard part is keeping track of it---my teenagers love it too...</li>
      <li>Wow.  </li>
      <li>used this on ~3 cysts (large, hard pimple nodules underneath the skin) and found the Zeno helped tremendously.</li>
      <li>It was very helpful in shrinking her pimples fast, and no chemicals on her skin or mess.</li>
      <li>So, in summary, I would not recommend the Zeno HotSpot because of the fact that it is disposable (which they don&#x27;t make much effort to point out to you unless you do a lot of research) and the fact that the Zeno company plans to only produce this product in the near future in order to increase its profit margins.</li>
      <li>I usually get the \\&quot;under the skin\\&quot; kind, the ones that never really surface but hang around for a long time.</li>
      <li>, The price is cheaper than other models, smaller than the Zeno Mini, seems to heat up faster than older model,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>

<li> Flat out a bummer.</li>
<li> it doesnt say which acne you can use it on until AFTER you buy it and open the package this is for teeny tiny small facial zits just starting NOT large deep cystic acne which is the hardest to treat and get rid of, such a disapointment.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s coincidence, but the very next day after I used the Zeno, the pimple was MARKEDLY reduced in size.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not surprised though.  </li>
<li> (That said, I HAD been doing all of those other things in the entire week before the Zeno treatments with NO success - it was only getting bigger.)  </li>
<li> the other one you can buy extra tips.  </li>
<li> With Zeno they stay a little red but are not a giant mountain.</li>
<li> I have used the zeno in total on roughly 10 different trouble spots.</li>
<li> The next morning, the raised white-head pimple was gone, but there was a small residual red area.</li>
<li> Once the battery finally dies, which is in less than 3 years, it cannot be replaced and the device must be thrown away).  </li>
<li> I get a few different kinds of acne.</li>
<li> After a few days of repeating using Zeno on the cysts (and applying calamine lotion afterward, just a personal thing I like to do), the lump and redness disappear!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Maybe a lot of people don&#x27;t realize this, but the Zeno HotSpot is a disposable device (unlike the other Zeno products). It costs $0.89 per use, and most pimples need 2 or 3 uses to go away.  Zeno&#x27;s website says they are planning to discontinue the Zeno classic, Zeno Pro and Zeno MD (all of which use a rechargable battery and use replacement tips which will still be sold Zeno says. Once the battery finally dies, which is in less than 3 years, it cannot be replaced and the device must be thrown away).  The Zeno Mini has been discontinued according to the Zeno website. However it is still available online from amazon and many other retailers. The Zeno Mini uses AA batteries so you don&#x27;t have to worry about the rechargable battery dying and making the device useless. If you buy rechargable AA batteries you will not have to worry about the cost of replacing the batteries, however. The replacement cartridges are still widely available online and in stores.  So, in summary, I would not recommend the Zeno HotSpot because of the fact that it is disposable (which they don&#x27;t make much effort to point out to you unless you do a lot of research) and the fact that the Zeno company plans to only produce this product in the near future in order to increase its profit margins.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Zeno using a gift card. I like that it cleared my skin after about 2 days. Some breakout areas took 3 days. I only have occasional breakouts each month. I noticed it caused a temporary redness that went away in a few hours. It&#x27;s easy to clean with a moist cloth.</li>
    <li> I bought my Zeno Hot Spot in a store this week in an effort to battle a HUGE pimple on my chin.  I&#x27;m a 25/f and the worst of my acne is behind me, but I have occasional hormonal flare ups.  This was not an ideal situation for a Zeno as it was a massive blemish by the time it was treated and over a week old.  I should also say that I did a variety of other things to combat this thing on the same day I did 2 Zeno treatments (warm compresses, Neosporin, etc).  (That said, I HAD been doing all of those other things in the entire week before the Zeno treatments with NO success - it was only getting bigger.)  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s coincidence, but the very next day after I used the Zeno, the pimple was MARKEDLY reduced in size.  So whether or not it&#x27;s the reason for my success I am sticking with this little thing!!!</li>
    <li> I had read all the great reviews on this product, and as I don&#x27;t have acne everywhere, I figured it would be perfect for the occasional (LARGE) blemish I get. I was RIGHT!!! I just got this thing tonight, and have done two cycles (waiting the appropriate 5 hours) and it&#x27;s already SIGNIFICANTLY smaller.    I HATE having pimples but also hate popping them due to scarring. Not only is this thing adorable, but it works AMAZINGLY! After one night, I&#x27;m hooked.    Can&#x27;t wait to see how it looks tomorrow!</li>
    <li> I bought and tried it for two months. It does not work on any pimples, big or small. It even burned my nose when a stubborn zit does not shrink at all after several applications. A total waste of money!! Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> This adorable compact pimple gizmo works great! I bought mine for travel about six months ago because I had such good results with the rechargeable model. This new Zeno is a great price and it works just as effectively as the older model in getting rid of beginning pimples.</li>
    <li> The Zeno Hot Spot is a wonderful little gadget...  I have suffered from occasional pre-menopausal/hormonal   acne breakouts around my chin - for the last several  years...this product has helped keep my blemishes  under control - LUV IT!</li>
    <li> OMG!  I just tried this gadget for the first time and it is everything I hoped it would be and more!  I just followed the simple directions and it did exactly what it said it would do.  You just zap your new zit a couple times, 3 to 4 hours apart and the zit is goes bye bye.  It has a nice, warm tingly feeling too.  Such a wonderful idea!  I wish I had heard of it sooner! The hard part is keeping track of it---my teenagers love it too... What a difference a couple zaps a day make on my face!</li>
    <li> Pros: Disposable Zeno&#x3D; no need to worry about finding replacement tips, The price is cheaper than other models, smaller than the Zeno Mini, seems to heat up faster than older model,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: display somewhat difficult to understand unless you memorize the manual,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lost my Zeno Mini about 8 months ago. I could not find replacement tips and was getting somewhat frustrated. I really like the Zeno and it works for my skin. I usually get breakouts about once every 3 weeks or a month. It helps when that one time you need it. I like this model in that you don&#x27;t have to worry about finding tips to replace and its cheaper. I don&#x27;t get that many breakouts but when I do, its good to have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend cleaning the tip with soap and water, I don&#x27;t like having to use a treatment and then use it again on the same spot later on if it&#x27;s dirty.</li>
    <li> I experienced a pretty bad breakout along my jawline from a prescription medication and picked up the Zeno Hot Spot to see if it would help out. WOW! To be honest, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much and although I&#x27;ve stopped taking the medication (which has stopped my breakouts) the Zeno has helped my existing blemishes tremendously.     I usually get the \\&quot;under the skin\\&quot; kind, the ones that never really surface but hang around for a long time. I read other reviews which said the Zeno wouldn&#x27;t help with these types of blemishes, but I&#x27;ve noticed they are healing much faster with use of the Zeno than they would normally on their own. It&#x27;s not an overnight cure, but it does help stubborn zits heal up pretty quickly and best of all it&#x27;s gentle on your skin. I&#x27;m definitely going to upgrade to the Zeno when my Hot Spot runs out.</li>
    <li> I have used the zeno in total on roughly 10 different trouble spots. I would say 3 of them got no help at all. Flat out a bummer. The other ones seemed to work. I usually get clogged pores and i am in my late 20&#x27;s. They get all red and huge and eventually come to a head so i can clean the gunk out. With Zeno they stay a little red but are not a giant mountain. The trick is to get these trouble spots hit with the zeno BEFORE they even develop. As soon as you feel it coming on just start zapping away. They stay red and very painful but they dont emerge into huge messes on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to figure out why this thing works on some zits and others not at all. Must be a different type of break out. I always follow with Benzoyl peroxide</li>
    <li> The website does not tell you that there are only 80 uses in the Zeno Hot Spot. After 80 uses, you have to go out and buy a new one. I can&#x27;t afford to go out and spend $35 everyother month!</li>
    <li> I am always researching products for my light acne. I must confess the Zeno has worked for me.  Here&#x27;s the thing. Sometimes it worked really well on painful emerging pimples around my chin. And that was great!  Other times it seemed to make already there pimples fade faster.    But many times, I did not notice a real difference. It seems a bit hit or miss. And sometimes it has made some spots worse.  I think it depends on the kind of pimple and where it is on your face.    I would buy it again because when it has worked, it has saved me from getting large painful pimples.</li>
    <li> Upon using this product, I was a real skeptic.  I know that I usually have areas on the chin that I didn&#x27;t think this would work on.  But, if you use this product when you feel a pimple coming on, it works amazingly.  I find that it was gone within 2-3 treatments of this zeno.  I know that I am always skeptical about the chemicals that you put on your face and if it is good for you, but the beautiful thing about this is that there are no harsh chemicals and it works!!!  I highly recommend that you try this product, you will be amazed and suprised yourself!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the original ZENO for years, and I&#x27;ve had great success with the disappearance of pimples that are newly forming.  I decided to try this new model HOT SPOT, and I love it.  It is easy to use, lightweight, heats up fast and of course still performs as good as the original model.  This technology is brillant.  It sounds so simple: use heat to kill the bacteria causing the pimple.  Wow.  I am grateful everyday for ZENO.  It has been a life saver many times.</li>
    <li> try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.  I have extremely stubborn skin.  I use proactiv faithfully, however i get an occasional zit..it did require a couple of uses..but a couple of days compared to weeks to get a zit to disappear is truly remarkable .I will recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> I get a few different kinds of acne. I get the normal hormonal kind but a deep cystic kind too. The directions say that Zeno is not for the deep ones but it has worked on mine! Any acne I zap with this goes away within a couple days. Sometimes the mark is still there but the bumps gone. Pain is gone. It might work for you too. Well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my teenage daughter because of the positive reviews. It was very helpful in shrinking her pimples fast, and no chemicals on her skin or mess. Technology is a wonderful thing. Thank you to those reviewers out there that gave us support and useful advice! There are definitely a lot more smiles around our house now. Thankfully the \\&quot;pimple Drama\\&quot; has leveled off</li>
    <li> Another hip product by Zeno!  I&#x27;m not surprised though.  After owning the rechargeable  model,  I bought this new one sometime in March and I found I like this one even better.  Besides the fact that it works just as well, it is more compact (you can discreetly take it anywhere), it has more lives, and it is cheaper!  CHEAPER is my favorite part, besides the fact that I have clear skin because of it!</li>
    <li> I had a bad experience with a terrible cyst before, and I never picked it, and it still left a scar. That&#x27;s what led me to investigate about Zeno, and buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have mild acne (white-heads, pustules) but every 1-3 weeks/occasionally, I get cystic acne or nodules, which are a severe form of acne. I first wash my face and make sure it&#x27;s completely dry. Then I hold the Zeno tip (not pressing too hard) on the skin over the pimple, until it beeps several times (indicating it&#x27;s done). You have to be patient to wait a few minutes holding it over your pimple, and afterward, it leaves a temporary red area in the treated spot, so it&#x27;s best to do it at night when you&#x27;re not going out in public. I gave this 4 stars mainly for that reason. However, it IS effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On mild acne:&lt;br /&gt;I had a white pustule pimple on my cheek, and treated it at night. Afterward, I dabbed some cooling calamine lotion using a Q-tip on the area. The next morning, the raised white-head pimple was gone, but there was a small residual red area. The swelling and raised white area was completely gone, though, and I was happy about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On severe acne:&lt;br /&gt;I used this on ~3 cysts (large, hard pimple nodules underneath the skin) and found the Zeno helped tremendously. Immediately after using, and following the next day, the hardened lump had decreased size significantly. After a few days of repeating using Zeno on the cysts (and applying calamine lotion afterward, just a personal thing I like to do), the lump and redness disappear! Thank God!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always clean my Zeno after using it, just by using a dry tissue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**update**&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for about 1-2 weeks now. I noticed that it would succeed in making the pimple smaller or disappear within 1-2 days of using it, but then later, a pimple would re-appear in the same spot. This either means that the device isn&#x27;t properly working on me, or I&#x27;m just prone to keep getting acne in the same spots. So, I ultimately ended up returning it. I also didn&#x27;t like the fact that it would make my skin so red after using it. The redness eventually went away after several hours, but still, I want something I can use before work and on-the-go, too. Unfortunately, this doesn&#x27;t seem to do that job.dn&#x27;t like the fact that it would make my skin so red after using it.

    <li> The zeno is a \\&quot;lifesaver\\&quot;! You feel the first zing of a pimple before it comes popping out and you treat it right away! It never even makes it to the surface to be seen! When you have a special day or just dont want to walk around with a zit on your face (or back, or chest...) you just Zeno it! I love love love the zeno hot spot because its so tiny! I can sometimes be doing a treatment and no one even realizes what Im doing....</li>
    <li> It works very well after one use it reduces the biggest knot pimples I don&#x27;t use it much on tiny pimples only on big ones. but it works amazing!</li>
    <li> For clearing blemishes, it helps a bit.   But don&#x27;t expect any miracles.    The thing that is completely ridiculous about this thing is that it&#x27;s disposable.  Not even replacable tips, like the older models.  But what&#x27;s sickening is that the unit is disposable for no reason whatsoever.  There are no chemicals that get used up, nor does the tip wear out in any way.    The unit has a chip that keeps track of the number of times that it is used.  Once that hits the limit, the unit disables itself.  If it weren&#x27;t for this self-destruct feature, this device could last a person a lifetime.  But that wouldn&#x27;t provide a recurring source of income for the manufacturer.    This manufacturer&#x27;s disrespect for both the consumer and the environment is just disgusting.</li>
    <li> This came in the mail and I used it three times then it stopped working. It starting blinking and beeping like it was out of uses. I am supposed to get way more than three uses out of this. This is a waste of money! I&#x27;m sure others are defective as well. It seems like a very cheap device. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> only 80 applications, then you throw it away.  the other one you can buy extra tips.  seems to help.</li>
    <li> I have had this product for little over 5 months. At first it worked, not as well as I thought it would. I only used a couple of times. I tried to use it today and it wouldn&#x27;t work. I changed the batteries and it still wouldn&#x27;t work. Therefore, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product unless you want to pay for a new one every couple of months.</li>
    <li> This BURNS your skin and casues scaring not only that it doesnt work, plus it doesnt say which acne you can use it on until AFTER you buy it and open the package this is for teeny tiny small facial zits just starting NOT large deep cystic acne which is the hardest to treat and get rid of, such a disapointment. also this is hard to use on anything but your face. cant use it on your back or shoulders.</li>
    <li> I never leave home without my Zeno.  If I feel a blemish coming I zap it and it is gone.  It has changed my life, no more popping zits or waiting for them to go away.  I never use zit creams anymore.</li>
