    <li> One of the best hair brushes out there. I&#x27;ve used this brand for 30 years, holds up well plus nice and stiff bristles... Just a little pricey.</li>
    <li> The brush is for my wife and she does like the feel of the bristles.</li>
    <li> I had one of these when I was a girl. I set out on a hunt to find another one and found it on Amazon. It really goes through my hair nicely and is pretty gentle and leaves the hair texture looking healthier.</li>
    <li> Just like the one I had as a teenager!  Perfect for fine hair.</li>
    <li> I have had this original Stanley brush for over 40 yrs .  they don&#x27;t make brushes with bristles like these anymore. My 10 yr old granddaughter uses it constantly when she is at my house, She says its the only brush that gets snarls out and makes her hair shine. I ordered one for her 11th birthday any it was her favorite gift, by far!</li>
    <li> Had one before and wanted exact same thing.</li>
    <li> I love my Stanley hairbrush.  Used to have one and somehow it got away from me. So glad to get another one, just like the other one.  It&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> I have use this same brush over 15 years, and was glad that I was able to find it still for sell. I am very pleased with the quality and performance of the brush. Thanks again for a great product. JM.</li>
    <li> I love it. Best hair brush on the market. My Mom gave me one fifty five years ago and it still looks new. I purchased this one for my Granddaughter and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Except for causing static, it at least gets through my thick hair. Which is hard to find these days. My mom used to sell Stanley (1960s I think). I still have my old brush, which has a row of bristles broken off from extended use. I just do not remember the static part.</li>
    <li> This is the fifth or sixth Lady Catherine Hairbrush I have owned over the past 40 years.  This last one, I ordered for my husband, because he had absolutely worn out the Lady Catherine Hairbrush that I had given him many years ago.  They&#x27;re almost indestructible!.</li>
    <li> I did not get the brush shown; seller said there was a note that comparable item would be sent, but, it was NOT comparable.  A hairbrush is a very personal item.  We all have different hair.  I chose this brush because it actually goes through my thick hair.  The one sent doesn&#x27;t even touch it.</li>
