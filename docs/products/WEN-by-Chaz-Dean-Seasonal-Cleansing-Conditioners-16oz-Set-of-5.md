      <li>I have 5 to choose from and have yet to choose my favorite.</li>
      <li>I loved this product, worth every penny</li>
      <li>The others were ok but the smell of mint took over and that&#x27;s all you could smell.  </li>
      <li>I love all WEN products, and couldn&#x27;t wait to jump on this deal of receiving the WEN Seasonal Cleansing Conditioners, which consist of 5 16oz bottles for under $160.00.</li>
      <li>Loved a diferent cent every day and the quality is far superior over any product.</li>
      <li>It was ok.  </li>
      <li>Planned to purchase more when tried out</li>
      <li>love these products.</li>
      <li>I was so glad to have found this fantastic offer!</li>
      <li>better than any salon product.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>So yes I love it.</li>
      <li>I always use WEN and now I love it even more because I can buy it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>But since using wen the winter one my hair has filled in and when I style the shape stays with me all day.  </li>
      <li>After using these cleansers, my hair looks great, my scalp feel clean and calm, and my hair is manageable and soft.</li>
      <li>Anyway decided to order and give it the full six weeks required.  </li>
      <li>Hair is soft, healthy, smooth.</li>
      <li>I love being able to change scents whenever I feel the mood for something different.</li>
      <li>Winter Vanilla Mint is not only my favorite Wen scent, it is also my favorite formula.  </li>
      <li>order came quickly with no hassles.</li>
      <li>I ordered right away and received my purchase quite quickly.</li>
      <li>My hair doesnt shed anymore, softness, shine, fresh.</li>
      <li>I was told to ship it back at my own expense but may receive credit for the shipping cost.</li>
      <li>It seems to work best on my fairly thin, very straight hair.  </li>
      <li>Not bad really, just not what I was expecting.</li>
      <li>I got my package right on time exactly when they said I would .</li>
      <li>I rinse with hot water.  </li>
      <li>You would think that with a pricey item such as Wen, I would have gotten treated better.</li>
      <li>My next favorite was the winter vanilla.</li>
      <li>She was completely impressed with how long my color has lasted and how soft and manageable my hair is even though I was and blow dry daily!)&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
      <li>WISH THEY WOULD FIGURE IT OUT and either put it in a different kind of bottle or send a new pump.</li>
      <li>I lost most of my hair from chemo several years ago and this product has helped with the new regrown hair.</li>
      <li>Real Wen.  </li>
      <li>It is so much softer and smoother.</li>
      <li>This stuff is an absolute miracle.</li>
      <li>The one I really like was the mango and coconut.</li>
      <li>After reading reviews I learned you really need to rinse out.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you save the pump you have, if the current one you have works, don&#x27;t throw it away before you test the new one that comes with your new bottle.</li>
      <li>Vanilla Winter Mint is my new FAV!  </li>
      <li>These cleansing conditioners meet the high Wen standards.</li>
      <li>My hair is extremely baby fine and not a lot there.  </li>
      <li>The gardenia is subtle and smells like fresh clean hair.</li>
      <li>Wen keeps my hair soft and shiny and doesn&#x27;t strip the color.  </li>
      <li>hair is always soft.</li>
      <li>First off, promised delivery by Christmas which didn&#x27;t happen by a long shot.</li>
      <li>Yes, it is more expensive, but the improvement in the health of my hair is well worth it</li>
      <li>i have been using the same bottle for 2 months, and it is still half full.</li>
      <li>and then I haven&#x27;t even found a single one yet that works for more than 12 oz of the 16 oz bottle, leading to some waste no matter how you try to get the last bit out of the bottle.</li>
      <li>This product is the only all-in-one product that I&#x27;ve found to keep my curls lush, touchable and shiny.  </li>
      <li>These WEN Cleansing Conditioners make my hair feel so soft, that I am constantly twirling my hair around my finger.</li>
      <li>(I really like the Fall Apple Spice and Pumpkin Spice scents but those formulas seem to be a bit thicker and heavier and weigh my hair down a bit.)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<li> i do not need to use the whole 10-20 pumps per washing as it recommends and have past shoulder length hair.</li>
<li> Huge bummer when it is SO EXPENSIVE.</li>
<li> but then again I didn&#x27;t rinse a long time.  </li>
<li> I can leave my hair to air dry and it looks like I&#x27;ve spend hours on it.</li>
<li> I LOVE THE WEN HAIR CONDITIONER, HOWEVER IT IS VERY EXPENSIVE.</li>
<li> last note, I use significantly less product than the twenty something pumps Wen recommends.  </li>
<li> Since I started using Wen products for my hair a year ago, there is less hair left in my comb after a shampoo and comb out.</li>
<li> Hoping the other seasons of wen do as well.  </li>
<li> The only negative is that it each shampooing uses a lot of cleanser, so it can get costly.</li>
<li> Because I go to the gym on a daily basis and work up a serious sweat, I was my hair every day.  </li>
<li> I have to assume that over the counter shampoos contained harsh chemicals which irritated my scalp.</li>
<li> Favorites are Spring Gardenia (smell reminds me of DHC&#x27; s Green Tea body wash) &amp; Vanilla Mint (husband &amp; I</li>
<li> The pomegranate smells like a piece of hard candy.</li>
<li> My scalp no longer itches when lying down, which previously drove me crazy.</li>
<li> but when I complained about service, I was made to feel unimportant and that it was a &#x27;tough luck</li>
<li> The only scent I was disappointed with was the ginger pumpkin.</li>
<li> Even though the stuff is expensive and hard for me to get, I won&#x27;t use anything else!  </li>
<li> but it is expensive.</li>
<li> When it did arrive it was the wrong flavors.</li>
<li> All in all a very poor customer service.</li>
<li> Again wasn&#x27;t crazy about the fall harvest</li>

    <li> I was so glad to have found this fantastic offer! I ordered right away and received my purchase quite quickly. Everything is as described, the packaging was very nicely done.Easy transaction and tracking! I love being able to change scents whenever I feel the mood for something different. I have 5 to choose from and have yet to choose my favorite. Wen products have always made me and my hair happy. Very good seller!</li>
    <li> Great product leaves my hair healthy looking despite my coloring my hair every 6 to 8 weeks holds color longer too</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo but don&#x27;t want to purchase it every month so buying bulk was great for me.&lt;br /&gt;The order came quickly with no hassles.</li>
    <li> I tried all 5 of the shampoos.  I was looking for something different than the almond mint.  The one I really like was the mango and coconut. My next favorite was the winter vanilla. The others were ok but the smell of mint took over and that&#x27;s all you could smell.  They all work the same, but I was looking for a different scent.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I lost most of my hair from chemo several years ago and this product has helped with the new regrown hair.</li>
    <li> Love WEN, save up for it in my budget now that I have discovered it. Only bummer is that they haven&#x27;t found a pump that works, yet. About one out of 3 work, and then I haven&#x27;t even found a single one yet that works for more than 12 oz of the 16 oz bottle, leading to some waste no matter how you try to get the last bit out of the bottle. Huge bummer when it is SO EXPENSIVE. WISH THEY WOULD FIGURE IT OUT and either put it in a different kind of bottle or send a new pump. Make sure you save the pump you have, if the current one you have works, don&#x27;t throw it away before you test the new one that comes with your new bottle.</li>
    <li> I love all WEN products, and couldn&#x27;t wait to jump on this deal of receiving the WEN Seasonal Cleansing Conditioners, which consist of 5 16oz bottles for under $160.00. Each bottle smells WONDERFUL, and just knowing how well they clean, condition, and moisturize my hair was an added incentive to order these amazing cleansing conditioners. The fragrances are delightful, and will make your hair smell wonderful; the scents are ginger pumpkin, spring gardenia green tea, pomegranate, summer mango coconut, and winter vanilla mint. I can&#x27;t keep my hands out of my hair! These WEN Cleansing Conditioners make my hair feel so soft, that I am constantly twirling my hair around my finger. After using these cleansers, my hair looks great, my scalp feel clean and calm, and my hair is manageable and soft. I absolutely love these conditioners, and I am extremely pleased that I was able to purchase the set of five cleansing conditioners for so a great affordable price. I would recommend this product to friends and family.</li>
    <li> Real Wen.  Great selection.  Favorites are Spring Gardenia (smell reminds me of DHC&#x27; s Green Tea body wash) &amp; Vanilla Mint (husband &amp; I agree smells like Andes mints).  Wonderful scents to get shower &amp;#34;lost&amp;#34; in.  Wish Wen would keep making them.  Sigh...</li>
    <li> Since I started using Wen products for my hair a year ago, there is less hair left in my comb after a shampoo and comb out. My scalp no longer itches when lying down, which previously drove me crazy. I have to assume that over the counter shampoos contained harsh chemicals which irritated my scalp. My hair is softer too. I will never go back to regular hair products! Yes, it is more expensive, but the improvement in the health of my hair is well worth it to me.&lt;br /&gt;My grown son uses it and likes it as well.&lt;br /&gt;Mrs. Tennant</li>
    <li> Winter Vanilla Mint is not only my favorite Wen scent, it is also my favorite formula.  It seems to work best on my fairly thin, very straight hair.  (I really like the Fall Apple Spice and Pumpkin Spice scents but those formulas seem to be a bit thicker and heavier and weigh my hair down a bit.)&lt;br /&gt;I started using Wen about one year ago on a whim, but I am now hooked.  Even though the stuff is expensive and hard for me to get, I won&#x27;t use anything else!  Because I go to the gym on a daily basis and work up a serious sweat, I was my hair every day.  Wen keeps my hair soft and shiny and doesn&#x27;t strip the color.  (I moved to Romania several months ago.  My hair stylist here never heard of Wen products.  She was completely impressed with how long my color has lasted and how soft and manageable my hair is even though I was and blow dry daily!)&lt;br /&gt;One last note, I use significantly less product than the twenty something pumps Wen recommends.  In fact I don&#x27;t use the pumps at all, I just squeeze the product into my hand and distribute it through my medium-length hair.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend gave me a sample of fall harvest wen.  It was ok.  Left a buildup in my hair.  After reading reviews I learned you really need to rinse out.  I rinse with hot water.  Anyway decided to order and give it the full six weeks required.  I started with the winter and I love it.  Again wasn&#x27;t crazy about the fall harvest but then again I didn&#x27;t rinse a long time.  Hoping the other seasons of wen do as well.  My hair is extremely baby fine and not a lot there.  But since using wen the winter one my hair has filled in and when I style the shape stays with me all day.  So yes I love it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is an absolute miracle. I did not believe my mom when she said it was the best thing ever, but it really is. Seems to help hair color last way longer (no detergent, so i guess that makes sense). Hair is soft, healthy, smooth. Pricey, but lasts forever-- i have been using the same bottle for 2 months, and it is still half full. i do not need to use the whole 10-20 pumps per washing as it recommends and have past shoulder length hair. Also, i find i only have to wash my hair every three days -- style it once and it stays nice and does not start looking funky and greasy for days. And oh my gosh, do these smell marvelous. Would give it 10 stars if I could.</li>
    <li> I loved this product, worth every penny but it is expensive. Loved a diferent cent every day and the quality is far superior over any product. I dont have allot of money but I save for this in my budget. My hair doesnt shed anymore, softness, shine, fresh. better than any salon product.</li>
    <li> Vanilla Winter Mint is my new FAV!  Smells great and my hair feels like silk.  Shampoo is so last year.  :)</li>
    <li> love these products. makes my hair appear fuller, thicker. everyone I know uses this.&lt;br /&gt;I also use the remoist for. hair is always soft.</li>
    <li> In just a week I have noticed a big change in my hair. It is so much softer and smoother. They also smell wonderful. I am very glad I ordered these.</li>
    <li> Shipped on time and great service! Awesome, awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome DId I say Awesome!</li>
    <li> I love wen by Chaz dean it is awesome . So is Amazon . I got my package right on time exactly when they said I would . I order a lot through amazon an I wouldn&#x27;t use anyone else their quality of service , customer service  is the beat. I trust amazon.</li>
    <li> This product is the only all-in-one product that I&#x27;ve found to keep my curls lush, touchable and shiny.  I can leave my hair to air dry and it looks like I&#x27;ve spend hours on it.</li>
    <li> These cleansing conditioners meet the high Wen standards. The mango coconut smells like suntan lotion. The vanilla mint smells like a peppermint patty. The pomegranate smells like a piece of hard candy. The gardenia is subtle and smells like fresh clean hair. The only scent I was disappointed with was the ginger pumpkin. It literally only smells like nutmeg. Not bad really, just not what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> First off, promised delivery by Christmas which didn&#x27;t happen by a long shot. Guaranteed by Christmas as per advertisement. Ordered on 15th received the 30th. When it did arrive it was the wrong flavors. Out of five, only got one of what was advertised. Planned to purchase more when tried out but when I complained about service, I was made to feel unimportant and that it was a &#x27;tough luck we aren&#x27;t gonna do anything to rectify&#x27;. I was told to ship it back at my own expense but may receive credit for the shipping cost. All in all a very poor customer service. You would think that with a pricey item such as Wen, I would have gotten treated better.</li>
    <li> I always use WEN and now I love it even more because I can buy it on Amazon. Watch WEN commercials; this product delivers what it promises. The only negative is that it each shampooing uses a lot of cleanser, so it can get costly.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE WEN HAIR CONDITIONER, HOWEVER IT IS VERY EXPENSIVE. I HAVE BOUGHT IT SEVERAL TIMES AND WOULD AGAIN IF I HAD THE MONEY.</li>
