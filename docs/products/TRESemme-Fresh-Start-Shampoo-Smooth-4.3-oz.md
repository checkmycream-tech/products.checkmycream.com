### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I&#x27;ve discovered that Batiste has the best ratings on Amazon</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll try them and hope for the best.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice smell, but I was not overly impressed with its ability to get rid of oil.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s affordable and smells great.</li>
      <li>Does not smell good.</li>
      <li>I was told a good tip is to spray this on before bed</li>
      <li>Its good to get you by for a day if your hair is in a point tail or styled up, but</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s nothing good I can say about this product.</li>
      <li>Smells good, absorbs oil and creates additional body.</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Also, it makes my hair kind of tacky all day, and I don&#x27;t like that.</li>
      <li>Strong smell but work well!</li>
      <li>On top of that, it STILL continued to STINK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the scent of this leave in.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just wayyy too overwhelming.</li>
      <li>It also looks gray until you work it into your hair, which is kind of nice for knowing exactly where you sprayed.</li>
      <li>Perfect dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>Great price and super fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Too cool!</li>
      <li>That being said, the residue is easily removed by brushing through your hair or rubbing with a towel or with your fingers.  </li>
      <li>The smell is so strong.</li>
      <li>And if you think the idea of using dry shampoo in lieu of washing, using this on clean hair gives great volume to your style and of course the amazing scent.  </li>
      <li>Free shipping from Amazon</li>
      <li>Oh no, that thing was gifted to someone else after the first use.</li>
      <li>Even when I use a blow dryer set on cool to brush and blow the residue out...</li>
      <li>By far the best dry shampoo spray out there.</li>
      <li>It is a strong chemical fragrance that wants to give you a headache.</li>
      <li>a good dry shampoo it terms of working as a &#x27;shampoo&#x27; but the smell.</li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>I like my Suave much better than this brand by far.</li>
      <li>Pretty good dry shampoo</li>
      <li>if you&#x27;re sensitive to strong smells.</li>
      <li>I think that I&#x27;m competent enough to do this the right way.</li>
      <li>According to the magazines, dry shampoo has undergone a revival, becoming the new tool of top stylists everywhere.  </li>
      <li>First, I can&#x27;t say I like the scent.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve read numerous instructions and am definitely able to follow instructions, so I&#x27;m not the problem.  </li>
      <li>I have used dry shampoos that are effective, this product has a very strong smell but is not useful, this company should take another look at what makes a dry shampoo effective and revamp their formula.</li>
      <li>and I found two cans of the original formula under my sink that I had completely forgotten about, so</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s long been a cult favorite which is why they were under my sink.  </li>
      <li>Love dry shampoos.  </li>
      <li>I love this dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>I love this dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>It was so strong and gross.</li>
      <li>It certainly can&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
      <li>It really does not do anything at all I have to say.</li>
      <li>I am brunette with medium-thin straight hair.</li>
      <li>: It really does get rid of the &amp;#34;grease&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>It has a great smell that lasts for days, refreshes hair between shampoos and leaves very little white powdery residue compared to others that I have tried.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I kept the receipt because this can is definitely going back to the drugstore.</li>
      <li>especially since I normally use more high end dry shampoos from Sephoras</li>
      <li>Thank you for making this such an easy buying process, especially during the hectic holiday season.</li>
      <li>There are better dry shampoos for the same price out there.</li>
      <li>and if you brush it out too quickly, or spray too much (so that your hair is actually WET), then it will snarl your hair.</li>
      <li>Do not buy if you are sensitive to smells!</li>
      <li>The only good thing is that it&#x27;s not as powdery white as some of the other dry shampoos.</li>
      <li>It smells just like their hair spray products (which I really like) and it doesn&#x27;t leave as much white residue/powder as the Suave product I used.</li>
      <li>Completely unusable.  </li>
      <li>The dry shampoo doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and allows me to continue to use my straightener without the burning hair smell because the smell of the dry shampoo is amazing.</li>
      <li>Terrific dry shampoo, worth the money and a bargain at that.</li>
      <li>I was using Suave&#x27;s dry shampoo and really didn&#x27;t like the smell of it</li>
      <li>I had soft hair before trying this and my hair feels gross and gunky to the touch now.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a LITTLE sticky at first..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried adjusting how much I use, but no matter what I do my hair feels weighed down and gunky.  </li>
      <li>The scent is refreshing, and it will keep the oil at bay for at least 2 days!!</li>
      <li>The complete opposite of what dry shampoo is supposed to do.</li>

<li> but it left such a mess of white gunk in my hair</li>
<li> I used it once before going to work, and I almost suffocated on the commute to work because of this dry shampoo.</li>
<li> , I was reluctant to try another dry shampoo.  </li>
<li> This dry shampoo does not work as described.</li>
<li> Hence, the dry shampoo.  </li>
<li> Does everything I remember dry shampoo doing plus adds body.  </li>
<li> I can only guess that those who are getting white residue are not shaking the can hard or long enough.</li>
<li> It is not helpful in extending your shampoo time or to give a little extra volume like</li>
<li> more-so by coating it than soaking it up, and leaves a little bit of a grey/white powder on your hair if you don&#x27;t brush it through properly.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried other dry shampoos (T3, Suave) and have had problems brushing them out</li>
<li> Leaves a tacky, heavy white residue.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried many other dry shampoos and this is by far the worst!</li>
<li> My scalp itched due to it.</li>
<li> I have long, thick biracial (black &amp; white) hair.</li>
<li> Other dry shampoos can keep my hair grease-free for at least 2 days, but this only lasts maybe half a day.</li>
<li> I still deal with a lot of oil when my hair is down.</li>
<li> This weighs my hair down.</li>
<li> gets rid of oil and hair is fluffy</li>
<li> The other ones I&#x27;ve tried were disappointing, even the very expensive one, so price obviously has little to do with success.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s just as bad, if not worse.  </li>
<li> This product was no better.</li>
<li> Waste of money!</li>
<li> Not worth a penny, totally weighs you hair down and leaves a white residue horrible don&#x27;t buy.</li>
<li> It smells awful and it is way to strong in scent.</li>
<li> And hair doesn&#x27;t feel icky.  </li>
<li> It left it so dirty looking that I gave up and took a shower and washed it out.  </li>
<li> Leaves your hair feeling dry and dirty feeling...</li>
<li> Leaves my hair feeling and looking worse than before.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Does everything I remember dry shampoo doing plus adds body.  Good product.</li>
    <li> Great price and super fast shipping. Thank you for making this such an easy buying process, especially during the hectic holiday season.</li>
    <li> It has a nice smell, but I was not overly impressed with its ability to get rid of oil.  Regular baby powder works better (but it smells weird and turns your hair white).  Its good to get you by for a day if your hair is in a point tail or styled up, but I still deal with a lot of oil when my hair is down.</li>
    <li> I thought this made my hair look and feel oiler than before!</li>
    <li> This made my hair feel gunky and dirty.  The complete opposite of what dry shampoo is supposed to do. I&#x27;ve tried many other dry shampoos and this is by far the worst! Leaves your hair feeling dry and dirty feeling... I had soft hair before trying this and my hair feels gross and gunky to the touch now. I even did it as directions stated.. Waste of money!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s terrible. The smell is so strong. I used it once before going to work, and I almost suffocated on the commute to work because of this dry shampoo. I couldn&#x27;t stop coughing. My scalp itched due to it. When I got to work, I had to use the sink TWICE to wash my hair - it look TWO times to wash this stuff out. On top of that, it STILL continued to STINK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy. Esp. if you&#x27;re sensitive to strong smells. This stuff is GRADE A HORRIBLE.</li>
    <li> CONS:It&#x27;s a LITTLE sticky at first.. and if you brush it out too quickly, or spray too much (so that your hair is actually WET), then it will snarl your hair. It definitely gets rid of shine.. more-so by coating it than soaking it up, and leaves a little bit of a grey/white powder on your hair if you don&#x27;t brush it through properly.  You&#x27;ll probably want to wash your hair the next day, especially if you exercise a lot (again, sticky/tangled hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: It really does get rid of the &amp;#34;grease&amp;#34; look, and is definitely affordable.  It doesn&#x27;t have an offensive smell, and the unwanted sheen is kept away for the entire day.  I like it because of the price, and it does what I need it to do.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It has a great smell that lasts for days, refreshes hair between shampoos and leaves very little white powdery residue compared to others that I have tried.  That being said, the residue is easily removed by brushing through your hair or rubbing with a towel or with your fingers.  And if you think the idea of using dry shampoo in lieu of washing, using this on clean hair gives great volume to your style and of course the amazing scent.  Get this yesterday, you need it in your life.</li>
    <li> By far the best dry shampoo spray out there. I&#x27;ve tried ones with Keratin and such, but they don&#x27;t soak up the oil like this one does. I was told a good tip is to spray this on before bed so it has time to work overnight, but I still end up using it in the morning as an emergency and it works out every time!</li>
    <li> I love this dry shampoo. After using this product it looked like I just washed my hair. I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> gets rid of oil and hair is fluffy</li>
    <li> Not worth a penny, totally weighs you hair down and leaves a white residue horrible don&#x27;t buy. Very disappointing i wasted money on this.</li>
    <li> Left my hair feeling dry. There are better dry shampoos for the same price out there.</li>
    <li> Pretty good dry shampoo especially since I normally use more high end dry shampoos from Sephoras but this is a keeper!</li>
    <li> Terrific dry shampoo, worth the money and a bargain at that.</li>
    <li> Very disappointing. Did not help reduce the look of oil in my hair at all. I have used dry shampoos that are effective, this product has a very strong smell but is not useful, this company should take another look at what makes a dry shampoo effective and revamp their formula.</li>
    <li> Perfect dry shampoo. Love it!</li>
    <li> I was using Suave&#x27;s dry shampoo and really didn&#x27;t like the smell of it so I sought out Tresemme. It smells just like their hair spray products (which I really like) and it doesn&#x27;t leave as much white residue/powder as the Suave product I used. I would definitely buy this again - it&#x27;s affordable and smells great.</li>
    <li> Love dry shampoos.  This was inexpensive.  Doesn&#x27;t leave too much of a white residue once brushed. And hair doesn&#x27;t feel icky.  That&#x27;s a plus!</li>
    <li> Oh no, the smell. It was so strong and gross. I couldn&#x27;t stand it. Yes it worked. Yes it was a good dry shampoo it terms of working as a &#x27;shampoo&#x27; but the smell. Noooooo. It lingers. You smell it for hours. It is a strong chemical fragrance that wants to give you a headache. Oh no, that thing was gifted to someone else after the first use. Do not buy if you are sensitive to smells!</li>
    <li> Smells good, absorbs oil and creates additional body. Doesn&#x27;t show any residue on blond hair. I can easily go 2 extra days without washing my hair, if I use this.</li>
    <li> UGH!  Worst dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.  Leaves my hair feeling and looking worse than before.  I&#x27;ve tried adjusting how much I use, but no matter what I do my hair feels weighed down and gunky.  Bought at drug store not Amazon but felt compelled to review since it is SO awful.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this leave in. It also looks gray until you work it into your hair, which is kind of nice for knowing exactly where you sprayed.</li>
    <li> I love this dry shampoo. I have long, thick biracial (black &amp; white) hair. I have never had any white residue on my hair. It does say on the side of the can to shake it vigorously. I can only guess that those who are getting white residue are not shaking the can hard or long enough. The dry shampoo doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and allows me to continue to use my straightener without the burning hair smell because the smell of the dry shampoo is amazing. It is not too overpowering. It will disappear over time just like perfume does. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Never clogs! White spray that rushes away! Strong smell but work well!</li>
    <li> First, I can&#x27;t say I like the scent. It&#x27;s just wayyy too overwhelming. Also, it makes my hair kind of tacky all day, and I don&#x27;t like that. Other dry shampoos can keep my hair grease-free for at least 2 days, but this only lasts maybe half a day. The only good thing is that it&#x27;s not as powdery white as some of the other dry shampoos. I personally recommend Got2Be Dry Shampoo. The scent is refreshing, and it will keep the oil at bay for at least 2 days!! And you can just brush out the powder with a brush or your fingers, and it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue...</li>
    <li> Just like others have said, the smell.  I had an allergic reaction to the overwhelming smell that I have never experienced with any other dry shampoo or hair care product.  My eyes watered and I could not stop sneezing until after I showered and changed clothes.  Completely unusable.  I can&#x27;t even tell you how it performed or lasted because I couldn&#x27;t keep the product on long enough to find out.</li>
    <li> Free shipping from Amazon but I do not like it. I like my Suave much better than this brand by far. I thought I would give it a try to make my order come out to the $35.00. It really does not do anything at all I have to say. It smells awful and it is way to strong in scent. It is not helpful in extending your shampoo time or to give a little extra volume like the Suave option does. Will not re order.</li>
    <li> I bought this at the drugstore because the packaging stated that there was no white residue.  I&#x27;ve tried other dry shampoos (T3, Suave) and have had problems brushing them out (they don&#x27;t brush out at all) and then leaving my hair feeling and looking dirtier than before.  I&#x27;d hoped this one was different.  NOPE!  It&#x27;s just as bad, if not worse.  I try not to wash my colored hair often and after the third day, my roots look oily.  Hence, the dry shampoo.  Years ago, I used Psst but it left such a mess of white gunk in my hair, I was reluctant to try another dry shampoo.  According to the magazines, dry shampoo has undergone a revival, becoming the new tool of top stylists everywhere.  So, thinking the product had been revamped, I decided to give it another go.  The other ones I&#x27;ve tried were disappointing, even the very expensive one, so price obviously has little to do with success.  This product was no better. I sprayed it on in 1 inch sections, waited 10 minutes, and then attempted to brush it out.  No way!  I looked like I hadn&#x27;t shampooed in weeks.  It left it so dirty looking that I gave up and took a shower and washed it out.  I&#x27;ve discovered that Batiste has the best ratings on Amazon and I found two cans of the original formula under my sink that I had completely forgotten about, so I&#x27;ll try them and hope for the best.  Batiste now makes colored formulas for blondes brunettes and redheads. Too cool! It&#x27;s long been a cult favorite which is why they were under my sink.  Perhaps the secret is to spray it on the night before and let the powder absorb the oil overnight.  I think that I&#x27;m competent enough to do this the right way. I&#x27;ve read numerous instructions and am definitely able to follow instructions, so I&#x27;m not the problem.  I&#x27;m glad I kept the receipt because this can is definitely going back to the drugstore. It certainly can&#x27;t hurt.  There&#x27;s nothing good I can say about this product. Save your pennies and buy something else instead.</li>
    <li> This dry shampoo does not work as described. Leaves your hair white, even after you&#x27;ve combed your hair the white is still visible.</li>
    <li> I am brunette with medium-thin straight hair. This weighs my hair down. Leaves a tacky, heavy white residue. Does not smell good. Even when I use a blow dryer set on cool to brush and blow the residue out... There are still white flakes that look like dandruff. Not buying again.</li>
