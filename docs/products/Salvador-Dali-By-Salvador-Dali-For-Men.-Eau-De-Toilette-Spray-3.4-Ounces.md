    <li> To my nose this smells very similar to Aramis, mixed with a touch of Santos de Cartier. If you like either of those, you&#x27;ll most likely appreciate this scent too. Projection: 5 / Sillage: 5</li>
    <li> in my opinion a men fragrance have to be like this, strong, with personality, massive and dense, thats what dali represent for me. If buy it i am sure that you gonna love it.</li>
    <li> Yummy.  Got this for my husband for Christmas.  It smells fantastic on him.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my boyfriend. He normally prefers Polo double black but he absolutely loved this one. I received the package super fast and the price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> Salvador Dal1 is my favorite artist . This spray is my favorite. I have stopped looking at different products since finding Dali . Packaging is great . No chance of breakage . The cute cashier at my local Starbucks gave me a free coffee when I stopped by last week. She liked what I was using and was surprised when I told her it was Salvador Dali. Also surprised when I told her she could buy her husband some at Amozon.com.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years, and am never disappointed in the great responses I get.  Not too sweet, not too mossy, not too woodsy, but just enough of each.  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Dark and smokey, this is exactly what all the \\&quot;black\\&quot; colognes should use as their model. Well worth picking up at this price!</li>
    <li> Dont buy this item! Is not the same of the picture! The item delivered have a blue box and the fragance is´nt the same</li>
    <li> This perfume came in a gift box with a mini and an aftershave. The packaging which I cannot/am not able to critique was done poorly. The mini somehow broke open and the \\&quot;lips\\&quot; assembly on the top of the bottle was in about 4 separate pieces. So when I got my package there was rattling and I could smell this stuff outside the brown box my order came in. The bottle now reeks of the stuff and my fingers get smell transferred to them when I touch it. Great product, poor packaging this time.</li>
    <li> Salvador is a classic from way back when! Could not believe that Amazon sells it. Very hard to get. Love the scent!</li>
    <li> This is one unique cologne.  You must not use too much of it.  Just a tiny bit will last you all day.  Too much of this will make you dizzy.</li>
    <li> Love the scent, always have. This bottle, however, had a faulty spritzer button. Have to replace it. But I will overcome.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cologne for years, and I absolutely love it.  Also I constantly get people asking what it is, and they always look confused when I say &amp;#34;Salvador Dali&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Very dark and incense like. Just what i was looking for.</li>
    <li> the best perfume  in the world !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;the delivery was very quick !!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect, perfect, perfect - thank you</li>
    <li> perfect  i like it very much</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not one that I reach for often, but it&#x27;s a very good fragrance.</li>
    <li> serious and responsible seller, 100% recommended, quality product</li>
