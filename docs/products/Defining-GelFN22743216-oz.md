      <li>Clean, does not dull, gives bounce to loose or tight curl.  </li>
      <li>This is the only gel that can handle my semi-spiky hairstyle AND completely wash out w/o leaving residue.</li>

    <li> Best gel I ever found for curly/permed hair.  Clean, does not dull, gives bounce to loose or tight curl.  Can&#x27;t find in any store, too bad, I&#x27;ve tried many gels, this is the best.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and like it. My hairdresser started me on it.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair product for people with curly hair.  It helps to control the curl and give it support in all types of weather.  I go through this stuff like crazy.  I would recommend it to anyone with curly hair!</li>
    <li> I ordered to bottles. When the package arrived, one of the bottles was broken. The pump was totally cracked off. Dissapointed in the packaging of the item.</li>
    <li> So glad I found this to buy online! I&#x27;ve been using this gel for a few years now and to find a good price I&#x27;ve had to drive pretty far!! This company has a good price AND free shipping!! Will definitely be buying this from them from now on! This is the only gel that can handle my semi-spiky hairstyle AND completely wash out w/o leaving residue. Love it! The only reason I gave it 4 and not 5 stars is that it is still a little pricey for my frugal checkbook.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this locally, but I was thrilled to find it online. It is light, but gives my slightly curly hair some body and shape.</li>
    <li> I have natural curls and it works perfect to help shape my hair as I blow dry it.</li>
    <li> i have naturally curly hair. it is a godsend. no build up. leaves hair curly without  buildup. does not let hair frizz even in florida. highly recommend it</li>
    <li> The product is one of my favorites.  However, the packing job on this was terrible.  The gel spilled everywhere and the inside was all sticky.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite gel for naturaly curly hair. Unlike some gels, this one does not leave my hair scrunchy and hard. It is a light gel but it still provides good hold. It is so difficult to find a product that controls the frizz without being so strong. This product provides that perfect mix of strong hold, without making my hair hard. I&#x27;ve been using this product for over ten years and absolutely love it. I hope they never stop making it because I&#x27;d be in big trouble. I haven&#x27;t been able to find another product that uniquely satisfies all my criteria for a curly hair gel.</li>
    <li> The same product as I usually buy at a store, but more reasonably priced, and&lt;br /&gt;ordering was quick and easy.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this hair product. Amazon has the best prices and fastest delivery I have ever experienced. I will be using Amazon for many purchases in the future....</li>
    <li> Great product, had a leaker might think of different packaging.</li>
    <li> I have stick straight hair.  Not a curl on my head.  How can it be that a product for permed or curly hair is my new favorite hair care product?  I think this stuff is mislabeled or being marketed to the wrong crowd.  It should say in big letters &amp;#34; This product will add major volume to straight hair and will keep that volume for the entire day&amp;#34;!  I never would have tried this if my hairdresser hadn&#x27;t used in to blow out my hair.  It keeps my hair soft and full and shiny.  So rename this product and double your sales!</li>
    <li> A little pricey but lasts a good, long time. I&#x27;ve bought other brands but keep coming back to this one. It rinses off my fingers easily and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel stiff at all. I only use it in my bangs and dry it with a round brush. It keeps my bangs from going flat against my forehead which I hate.</li>
    <li> This gel is used by my hairdresser . I love the smell and how much hold and volume my thin hair gets from this product . Great price . Glad Amazon sells it . Will order again</li>
    <li> I have long curly hair, and I live in South Florida.  I have tried tons of different products, and I&#x27;ve been disappointed time after time.  I&#x27;m looking for soft curls that look natural without frizz.  I use three pumps of this product, with three pumps of Aquage Curl Gel.  I mix them in my hand and apply to towel dried hair.  I comb it through and let dry on its own.  I am thrilled with the results!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  After applying, I comb it through, then shake my head and let my curls dry naturally.  After it&#x27;s dry I scrunch out the crunchiness.  My hair feels silky and doesn&#x27;t look wet.  And, no frizz!</li>
    <li> my stylist uses this and I love the way it holds my hair and it smells so good too!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Got a honeydew from the wife for getting her favorite. Her heir swears by this gel for being natural, soft and manageable. Can&#x27;t wait for my next honeydew award.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have been using it for over a year. It is a great product for curly hair.</li>
    <li> This is the best gel for natrurally curly hair. I have tried every brand and still go back to Aquage!</li>
    <li> my favorite use it every day</li>
    <li> Best product for curly hair on the market</li>
    <li> I have used Aquage Defining Gel Unisex for several years and love it. I love the scent it has. It is, however, expensive.</li>
    <li> I use it every time I wash my hair.  Just a little bit goes a long way.  It is perfect for keeping the frizz down on my hair type.</li>
    <li> Love this gel for the scrunch look.  Just reshape hair a little each day with your hands, and you&#x27;re good to go.  Hairdo can be made to last several days at a time.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!!! Great for frizzy and curly hair!</li>
    <li> This has always been my go-to gel to keep my cowlick from taking over the world. The pump makes things so much easier, but try to keep the spout clean from hardening gel or it will squirt all over you.</li>
    <li> Great for fine thin hair. Gives great body.</li>
    <li> I have been using Aquage products for years, and the defining gel is the best out there, plus it smells great in a clean and subtle way.  The 16 ounce pump bottle is so convenient. One pump is all it takes - and the bottle lasts forever.  This product is not easy to find and very few places around me carry any Aqage products.  Don&#x27;t know why, they blow others out of the water.</li>
    <li> I received this product very quickly. It was well packaged and brand new. This product works well on my hair as a finisher.</li>
    <li> I discovered this through my old hair dresser. I love it. I gives my a nice hold with defined curls without making my hair crunchy or wet looking. I can not find this in any of my local store. I&#x27;m very glad I can get it through Amazon. A number of friends have switched to this gel as well after asking me what I use. I have long curly hair but I know people who use it on wavy and straight hair as well.</li>
    <li> Favorite hair gel EVER!  I have curly hair and have tried many different products over the year.  My hair dresser turned me on to this years ago and I have never wanted to use anything else every since.  It is a very liquidy gel so you NEVER get the chunks of dried hair gel in your hair.  It is easy to distribute evenly throughout your hair.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!  I have fine naturally curly hair and aquage defining gel is the ONLY product that tames my locks.  I use a leave-in conditioner made by Rusk on my wet hair first and then apply three pumps of this over the top.  I highly recommend this product for curly hair!</li>
    <li> Best hair gel. Doesn&#x27;t make your hair crispy. It&#x27;s a soft defining gel and I have crazy curls that need to be tamed.</li>
    <li> the stuff do its function on hair.  how much can you talk on about hair products...it done works on my hair</li>
    <li> Good product for Curley hair</li>
    <li> I have Curley hair and have been using this for years, I put in hair wet after shower scrunch and either air or defuse dry.</li>
    <li> Great service, love product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  I use it exclusively so I like to buy the bigger size (cost effective), and I can only find it online.  Free shipping with Amazon Prime doesn&#x27;t hurt either.  Before using this product my hair would get frizzy by the end of the day or if I didn&#x27;t wash it every day.  Now I can go a day or two without having to wash it (so much better for your hair) and it still looks good.</li>
    <li> Keeps your curls all day long and reduces Frizz</li>
    <li> I use this get quite a bit.  Works good, although I do use several others and they are all about the same.</li>
