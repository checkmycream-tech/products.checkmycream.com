### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I now get comments on how beautiful my skin is!</li>
      <li>Excellent product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I am not one to spend my money on skin care products, but I am so happy that I found this cream.  </li>
      <li>After talking with them, I felt good about ordering this product.</li>
      <li>fish collagen - good for skin, hair and nails.&lt;br /&gt;Applied DelfogoRX Telomere DNA Cell Cream nightly to face</li>
      <li>My wife said I look like I got a good night&#x27;s sleep</li>
      <li>(To be honest: I laughed at her.)</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>This product did an amazing job on me skin .</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own moisture</li>
      <li>/&gt;First, I liked the way it felt going on.  </li>
      <li>The science and research based products they produce are, in my opinion, the absolute best on the market.</li>
      <li>Not some kind of greasy or oily feeling.</li>
      <li>Now that I am in my 30s, it is even trickier because, like most people, I am kind of vain, and don’t want WRINKLES.</li>
      <li>Really glad.  </li>
      <li>My skin was more evenly toned.  </li>
      <li>Before I bought this product, I just wanted to know if it was gonna work any better than all the others I&#x27;ve tried</li>
      <li>I researched many companies before I settled on DelfogoRX and have not been dissapointed.  </li>
      <li>I actually contacted SkinPro to find out if this would be the best product since Delfogo Rx makes a ton of products.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I absolutely love the Telomere DNA Cell Cream.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this night cream.</li>
      <li>Luckily I am not alone in the quest for great skincare, and a friend recommended I try DelfogoRx Telomere DNA Cell Cream because she had used it and saw great results.</li>
      <li>One of the best things about the cream is that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance like other skin care products.</li>
      <li>This cream was very mild</li>
      <li>was so strong it made my eyes water</li>
      <li>Fine lines that I was been noticing for years faded like the sun spots.</li>
      <li>I don’t have the best skin in my family, so I was not shocked when my face started to wrinkle a lot sooner than expected.  </li>
      <li>I did go through a series of chemical peels that made a huge difference, but at $100 a pop, I couldn&#x27;t afford to keep up with them.  </li>
      <li>Best of all, it evened out my skin tone and helped firm up the skin around my eyes.</li>
      <li>I am very happy to have found this skin care line and definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to improve the quality of their skin.</li>
      <li>it feels so good on my face and my face is really soft when I wake up.</li>
      <li>First of all, I should say that I don’t buy many drugstore skin products – as a mom of two kids</li>
      <li>After seeing the results Telomere has given her, I was excited about the thought of a product that worked.  </li>
      <li>and Im pretty sure that made an impact on my skin too.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
      <li>Definitely a good way to go if you&#x27;re looking for something to help with similar problems.</li>
      <li>I use it as a night cream and can really see the difference in the texture, firmness and a more even skin tone.  </li>
      <li>I noticed right away that cream was rich, almost decadent, but didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily or greasy at all.</li>
      <li>Not only has it made significant changes to my own eye wrinkles, but it has helped with some damaged skin around my nose and lips.</li>
      <li>Will not purchase again due to the fact it did not deliver any remarkable or measurable change.</li>
      <li>I have been using DelfogoRX Telomere DNA Cell Cream as for several years and am so pleased with the results!  </li>
      <li>Im a 37 year fitness trainer and eat pretty clean and drink tons of water.</li>
      <li>I had been kind of alarmed in recent years to see wrinkles and spots appearing on my face.</li>
      <li>I trust this comment, although more direct, falls under AMAZON.COM&#x27;s guidelines for an acceptable review.  </li>
      <li>My skin is clearer, brighter and it just makes me wanna smile.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed over the years some fine lines and wrinkles creasing my face as I get older.</li>
      <li>There was a significant reduction of wrinkles across my forehead, the pores on my nose had shrunk, and my overall skin tone became more even with a noticeable glow.</li>
      <li>But she is usually right, so I tried it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;After a month of steady usage, my knee feels a lot better, not healed or pain free but a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;After a month of using DelfogoRX Telomere DNA Cell Cream and adding the above supplements I saw NO improvement in lines or wrinkles on my face.  </li>
      <li>I felt so much better about the way I looked when I had a date a few days ago because my skin just looked so much better</li>
      <li>I felt like I wasted my money which is why I deem it important to write this review again for those who are wanting honest reviews of this item.</li>
      <li>I can relax and do my thing now without feeling self conscious, and that&#x27;s a huge weight off.</li>
      <li>Within days my skin just looked better, decreasing lines (I&#x27;m an occasional smoker) and improving color, too.  </li>
      <li>but I went to a interview for a job last Tuesday and the lady says to me, \\&quot;Okay, so you&#x27;re,</li>
      <li>My skin tone was different, better.</li>
      <li>This cream has faded away many sunspots that I never thought would be possible.</li>
      <li>I recommend this product for men and women, almost any age, it will help you look younger and better.</li>
      <li>At first, I thought I noticed improvements but didn&#x27;t want to jump to conclusions.</li>
      <li>I notice more of an impact when I use it daily rather than sporadically.  </li>
      <li>Scamers, fake reviews, dries out skin, causes pimples, if thats what you&#x27;re looking for, perfect</li>
      <li>I am so glad I did, because the only other product I have had these results with is more than twice the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The Telomere cream seems to have a positive overall effect on my skin – it minimizes my pores and has been improving my fine lines.  </li>
      <li>After a few weeks of consistent application, I noticed a great deal of difference in the texture and overall appearance of my skin.</li>
      <li>I like to keep it on the down low that I use good skin products as a guy, but I sincerely love this one and would recommend it to anyone I know going through similar skin problems.</li>
      <li>While I would still be considered young, most of my research on skin care tells me that I should start anti-aging treatment in my early 30s for optimum results later down the line.</li>
      <li>I noticed a huge difference after only a week.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know much about Telomeres</li>
      <li>&quot; Wow, that&#x27;s what I call success.</li>
      <li>really my biggest issue- to fade.</li>
      <li>The lines under my eyes a few weeks later seemed to have faded more and made me look and feel healthier and more relaxed.  </li>
      <li>My fine wrinkles have pretty much disappeared and I no longer have dry patches on my skin.</li>
      <li>on yes this thing really works</li>
      <li>Finally, a product worth reviewing!  </li>
      <li>This is the first skin cream I have tried but with it doing Nada,  zilch, nothing I don&#x27;t think I will waste any more money on it.</li>
      <li>After continued use, I was so thrilled that my skin started to firm up!</li>
      <li>I have now eliminated several products from my daily beauty regimen since this one cream does so many things.</li>
      <li>The fine lines around my eyes (aka laugh lines, which are no laughing matter at my age) were FAR less noticeable.</li>
      <li>I have wasted my time and money on too many facial products that just didn&#x27;t work in an attempt to look younger and just make my skin FEEL better.</li>
      <li>I tried DelfogoRx Telomere DNA Cell Cream (need to shorten this name) without expecting much, but boy was I pleasantly surprised.  </li>
      <li>and I had no problem adding it into my normal skin care regime.</li>
      <li>added to my normal vitamin and glucosamine regimen the following&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stem</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t normally shout it to the rooftops about a skincare product</li>
      <li>a few fine lines, patches of redness, and large pores.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended – it has worked well for me so far!</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different things over the years to deal with redness and blotches as it makes me feel less than confident</li>
      <li>Since using it, my cheeks seem to be more firm and not dry.</li>
      <li>Naturally, I kept on using DelfogoRx Telomere DNA Cell Cream</li>
      <li>I am naturally a skeptic.</li>
      <li>, I am 67 years old.</li>
      <li>My 48th birthday is fast approaching and the mirror reminds me of that every day!</li>
      <li>It tightens and brightens the skin and feels absolutely natural on your face.</li>
      <li>My face has a glow that I haven&#x27;t seen since I was a young girl.  </li>
      <li>I recommend it to anyone, even guys as old as me.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend DelfogoRx Telomere DNA Cell Cream to anyone who is looking for a product that actually makes a difference!</li>
      <li>No other skin care product has allowed me to feel this rejuvenated.</li>
      <li>It actually left my skin feeling dewy and soft and fresh instead or weighed down.</li>
      <li>It seems to make my old skin look a little smoother, like it very much.</li>
      <li>Having recently turned 40, I’m starting to see a few signs of aging, like fine lines.  </li>
      <li>I don’t have acne, but have had some issues with clogged pores and general “look”/texture of my skin.  </li>
      <li>You have to try it , it really made my skin very clear and firm.</li>
      <li>That said, there are a few products I’m willing to splurge on, and this is one of them.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> No visible results at any time while using this product.  This comment was posted previously with my purchase a few months ago, but was deleted earlier today by amazon. I trust this comment, although more direct, falls under AMAZON.COM&#x27;s guidelines for an acceptable review.  Will not purchase again due to the fact it did not deliver any remarkable or measurable change. I felt like I wasted my money which is why I deem it important to write this review again for those who are wanting honest reviews of this item.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!&lt;br /&gt;I purchase this item when I read reviews back in June. I started using a few times a week as a night moisturizer. Then as the summer came to end, I began using it morning and night. I notice month later my skin was tighter and hardly any breakouts. My friend asked me what I was using on my face. I told her this product and she said she noticed a big different in my skin. I have picture to proof the stuff works. Im a 37 year fitness trainer and eat pretty clean and drink tons of water. I also want to mention along with my skin treatment I took Vital--collagen you can find on Amazon.com ..it&#x27;s a beef gelatin for anti aging you put a scoop into your juice or protein powder. I started that in July and Im pretty sure that made an impact on my skin too.&lt;br /&gt;1 bottom last me about 2 1/2-3 months..Just a dab goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is some of the ingredient is pharmaceutical grade medication and some chemical bonds.. I did get red in the face for about 10 mins every time I use it. It did go away after a month of use.</li>
    <li> Saw no results with this product</li>
    <li> I tried DelfogoRx Telomere DNA Cell Cream (need to shorten this name) without expecting much, but boy was I pleasantly surprised.  Within days my skin just looked better, decreasing lines (I&#x27;m an occasional smoker) and improving color, too.  My wife said I look like I got a good night&#x27;s sleep (she didn&#x27;t know I was using it) and I&#x27;ve noticed other people&#x27;s reactions, too.  Definitely makes me look a bit younger (than 47).  My skin is clearer, brighter and it just makes me wanna smile.  Before I bought this product, I just wanted to know if it was gonna work any better than all the others I&#x27;ve tried and it did.  Really glad.  Finally, a product worth reviewing!  I recommend this product for men and women, almost any age, it will help you look younger and better.</li>
    <li> My 48th birthday is fast approaching and the mirror reminds me of that every day! I have wasted my time and money on too many facial products that just didn&#x27;t work in an attempt to look younger and just make my skin FEEL better. I found DekfogRx Telomere DNA Cell Cream while reading through different products here on Amazon. The product promised to give me everything I wanted in one product so I thought, \\&quot;Why not?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started by using the Telomere DNA Cell Cream at night, before bed. I noticed right away that cream was rich, almost decadent, but didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily or greasy at all. It actually left my skin feeling dewy and soft and fresh instead or weighed down. Within a couple of weeks I saw an improvement in my skin&#x27;s texture. My skin tone itself had leveled out, the dark spots and redder areas were fading and my pores no longer looked like craters on the moon&#x27;s surface! The fine lines around my eyes (aka laugh lines, which are no laughing matter at my age) were FAR less noticeable. After continued use, I was so thrilled that my skin started to firm up! The lose skin around my eyes, on my neck and my cheeks had started to plump up a bit and tighten. My skin started feeling softer all the time, not just after application of the cream, almost like my skin had learned to hold it&#x27;s own moisture again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I absolutely love the Telomere DNA Cell Cream. It delivers what it promises.I have now eliminated several products from my daily beauty regimen since this one cream does so many things. I love it!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00EQ54S4E DelfogoRx Telomere DNA Cell Cream]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I am naturally a skeptic. I am also an (ahem) senior citizen. My wife suggested I try this DelfogoRx Telomere DNA Cell Cream. (To be honest: I laughed at her.) But she is usually right, so I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;First, I liked the way it felt going on.  Not some kind of greasy or oily feeling. So I used the DNA Cell Cream for three weeks. Like I said, I don&#x27;t believe something until the check is in the mail.  My skin tone was different, better. My face looked, I guess the term is \\&quot;younger.\\&quot; Some of the splotches and wrinkles, especially around my eyes actually went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I am 67 years old. but I went to a interview for a job last Tuesday and the lady says to me, \\&quot;Okay, so you&#x27;re, what... 50.\\&quot; Wow, that&#x27;s what I call success. Naturally, I kept on using DelfogoRx Telomere DNA Cell Cream and I noticed something I didn&#x27;t expect. My skin felt like it was moist instead of dry and flaky. That makes me feel better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried figuring out why it works so well but gave up when I found words like \\&quot;Peptides\\&quot; and \\&quot;Teprenones.\\&quot; (Sounds like a pair of Barber Shop quartets.)&lt;br /&gt;If they have a contest to rename it, I suggest \\&quot;It works! Cell Cream Moisture\\&quot; or something.&lt;br /&gt;This skeptic is convinced by using it. I recommend it to anyone, even guys as old as me.</li>
    <li> This product did an amazing job on me skin . You have to try it , it really made my skin very clear and firm.</li>
    <li> First of all, I should say that I don’t buy many drugstore skin products – as a mom of two kids, I’m thrifty and typically looking for a bargain.  That said, there are a few products I’m willing to splurge on, and this is one of them.  Having recently turned 40, I’m starting to see a few signs of aging, like fine lines.  I don’t have acne, but have had some issues with clogged pores and general “look”/texture of my skin.  The Telomere cream seems to have a positive overall effect on my skin – it minimizes my pores and has been improving my fine lines.  I notice more of an impact when I use it daily rather than sporadically.  This winter (very cold, windy, and harsh weather conditions where I am) it has helped me avoid the dry skin issues that I typically have in the colder months.  Highly recommended – it has worked well for me so far!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally shout it to the rooftops about a skincare product (Cause I&#x27;m a dude) but&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different things over the years to deal with redness and blotches as it makes me feel less than confident and I hate going out when my face is a mess. A friend recommended I try this skin cream and I have to say...I noticed a huge difference after only a week. I felt so much better about the way I looked when I had a date a few days ago because my skin just looked so much better and my confidence was through the roof. I like to keep it on the down low that I use good skin products as a guy, but I sincerely love this one and would recommend it to anyone I know going through similar skin problems. I can relax and do my thing now without feeling self conscious, and that&#x27;s a huge weight off. Definitely a good way to go if you&#x27;re looking for something to help with similar problems.</li>
    <li> Scamers, fake reviews, dries out skin, causes pimples, if thats what you&#x27;re looking for, perfect</li>
    <li> I have had difficult skin my whole life—dry patches, oily patches and mild acne mixed in. It is frustrating and difficult to find products that work well without over drying or overly moisturizing. Now that I am in my 30s, it is even trickier because, like most people, I am kind of vain, and don’t want WRINKLES. Luckily I am not alone in the quest for great skincare, and a friend recommended I try DelfogoRx Telomere DNA Cell Cream because she had used it and saw great results.I was skeptical at first, but figured it was worth a shot. I am so glad I did, because the only other product I have had these results with is more than twice the price.&lt;br /&gt;I was actually surprised that the DNA cell cream has not only made my wrinkles less noticeable, but has also evened out my overall skin texture and tone. My face is smoother and tauter than it has been in years. The only downside was that the first few days my skin was a bit oilier that usual and I had a minor breakout (which happens to me when I change my skin routine).</li>
    <li> I was a 70&#x27;s sun worshiper and my face has shown the effects of it. This cream has faded away many sunspots that I never thought would be possible. I will continue to use it. I now get comments on how beautiful my skin is! It&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;B Parker&lt;br /&gt;atoka tn</li>
    <li> I don’t have the best skin in my family, so I was not shocked when my face started to wrinkle a lot sooner than expected.  In the last year I went through a divorce and the stress took it&#x27;s toll on my face.  My sister recommended this Telomere cream to me a few months ago. She had the hardest time with the wrinkles around her eyes and nothing she did made any difference. After seeing the results Telomere has given her, I was excited about the thought of a product that worked.  I actually contacted SkinPro to find out if this would be the best product since Delfogo Rx makes a ton of products.  After talking with them, I felt good about ordering this product. Not only has it made significant changes to my own eye wrinkles, but it has helped with some damaged skin around my nose and lips. The redness I always had on my cheeks has gone down and is smoother than ever! I am not one to spend my money on skin care products, but I am so happy that I found this cream.  Only downfall is that I broke out a little bit when I first started using it.  Nothing horrible and it went away in about a week.</li>
    <li> I had been kind of alarmed in recent years to see wrinkles and spots appearing on my face. Unfortunately, I procrastinated all of my life about starting a regime applying sunscreen every day, and all the sun exposure started to take its toll around the time I turned 55 or so. Now I&#x27;m trying to do double time and reverse the damage that is already been done.  I did try a few different products to make my skin stop looking  aged, and I&#x27;m sorry to say that many products made no difference.  I did go through a series of chemical peels that made a huge difference, but at $100 a pop, I couldn&#x27;t afford to keep up with them.  Once I stopped, the spots came back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doing some research online, I came across DelfogoRx Telomere DNA Cell Cream. I was optimistic about this product because it sounded like it had some science behind it. At first, I thought I noticed improvements but didn&#x27;t want to jump to conclusions. Once I saw myself in a few pictures, I could really tell a difference. Was happiest about the fact that the cream had caused my sun spots- really my biggest issue- to fade. Other than that, I noticed that my skin was more moist and looked less dried out and leathery. Fine lines that I was been noticing for years faded like the sun spots.</li>
    <li> I have been using DelfogoRX Telomere DNA Cell Cream as for several years and am so pleased with the results!  I use it as a night cream and can really see the difference in the texture, firmness and a more even skin tone.  My face has a glow that I haven&#x27;t seen since I was a young girl.  I researched many companies before I settled on DelfogoRX and have not been dissapointed.  The science and research based products they produce are, in my opinion, the absolute best on the market.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed over the years some fine lines and wrinkles creasing my face as I get older. I also suffer from dry skin around my mouth and nose. While I would still be considered young, most of my research on skin care tells me that I should start anti-aging treatment in my early 30s for optimum results later down the line. After looking through a couple products, I came upon DelfogoRX Telomere DNA Cell Cream and, after reading the rave reviews, decided to give it a try. The product claims to restore skin on a cellular level, which sounds a bit ridiculous to my skeptical mind. Still, after about a month of use I began to notice some improvements. My fine wrinkles have pretty much disappeared and I no longer have dry patches on my skin. Best of all, it evened out my skin tone and helped firm up the skin around my eyes. I even got carded recently to buy a lottery ticket! One of the best things about the cream is that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance like other skin care products. Previously I used L&#x27;Oreal Collagen Moisture Filler and the scent was so strong it made my eyes water and it made me break out horribly. This cream was very mild and I had no problem adding it into my normal skin care regime. Definitely give this a shot!</li>
    <li> purchased it for my wife its been two weeks now on yes this thing really works</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had lines under my eyes even in my twenties from lack of sleep and such. Lately I&#x27;ve noticed my skin on my cheeks get dry in the fall time. My friend Sarah told me to try DelfogoRx Telomere DNA Cell Cream.  I don&#x27;t know much about Telomeres but I do understand that this product works to fix skin on the inside, on the DNA level.  Since using it, my cheeks seem to be more firm and not dry. My skin was more evenly toned.  The lines under my eyes a few weeks later seemed to have faded more and made me look and feel healthier and more relaxed.  I&#x27;m eager to see how another month or so will make my skin look.</li>
    <li> This cream is divine...it feels so good on my face and my face is really soft when I wake up.</li>
    <li> It seems to make my old skin look a little smoother, like it very much.</li>
    <li> I am a 60 yo male work out 5 times a week and am told I look younger than what I am.  I was looking for a Stem Cell product to help my knee joint pain and came across DelfogoRX Telomere DNA Cell Cream.  With all of the rave reviews I thought I would it give a try  along with other products I was going to use for my knee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added to my normal vitamin and glucosamine regimen the following&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stem Cell Worx Intraoral Spray&lt;br /&gt;carnosine - anti-aging amino acid&lt;br /&gt;carnitine - anti-aging and weight loss amino acid&lt;br /&gt;Hydrolyzed fish collagen - good for skin, hair and nails.&lt;br /&gt;Applied DelfogoRX Telomere DNA Cell Cream nightly to face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month of steady usage, my knee feels a lot better, not healed or pain free but a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;After a month of using DelfogoRX Telomere DNA Cell Cream and adding the above supplements I saw NO improvement in lines or wrinkles on my face.  This is the first skin cream I have tried but with it doing Nada,  zilch, nothing I don&#x27;t think I will waste any more money on it.</li>
    <li> I had been on the hunt for a skin care product that goes hand in hand with my type of skin- a few fine lines, patches of redness, and large pores. After months and months of switching from one skin care product to another, I began to lose hope. Eventually, I was recommended DelfogoRx Telomere DNA Cell Cream by my sister-in-law. I did some research on the product and decided to give it a shot. After a few weeks of consistent application, I noticed a great deal of difference in the texture and overall appearance of my skin. There was a significant reduction of wrinkles across my forehead, the pores on my nose had shrunk, and my overall skin tone became more even with a noticeable glow. With the use of this product, I feel like my skin tone and texture has changed drastically. No other skin care product has allowed me to feel this rejuvenated. I highly recommend DelfogoRx Telomere DNA Cell Cream to anyone who is looking for a product that actually makes a difference!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this night cream. It tightens and brightens the skin and feels absolutely natural on your face. I use it in combination with the HGF youth elixir serum in the evenings. I am very happy to have found this skin care line and definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to improve the quality of their skin.</li>
    <li> I am sold. I have definitely seen an Improvement in the lines on my face, and what clinched it for me was, OTHER PEOPLE noticed as well. I&#x27;ve actually had some who asked what I was doing, as it was obvious I WAS doing something. I will definitely repurchase.</li>
