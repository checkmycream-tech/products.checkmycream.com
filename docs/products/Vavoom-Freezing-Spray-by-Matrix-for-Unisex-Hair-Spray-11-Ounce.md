      <li>This hairspray has a nice fragrance that is not overpowering.</li>
      <li>I thought I would give this one a try since it had some nice reviews.</li>
      <li>My hair has a mind of its own and even sometimes resists a curling iron.</li>
      <li>This hairspray is absolutely the best.  </li>
      <li>the smell is very strong - like stepping into a beauty salon...</li>
      <li>I had to fortify this hold with another product which isn&#x27;t ideal as I don&#x27;t like having too much product in my hair.  </li>
      <li>I have a lot of very fine hair and product</li>
      <li>but this hairspray has a good, mild smell that does not trigger a headache for me.</li>
      <li>I love this hairspray.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many brands of hairspray, but I love Vavoom.</li>
      <li>My favorite hairspray.  </li>
      <li>YES I LOVE IT</li>
      <li>She used to buy it all the time at the hairdresser and paid a lot more for it.</li>
      <li>Always buy this many stores aren&#x27;t carrying this any longer.</li>
      <li>Have been using this product for many years.</li>
      <li>and you have to use more to achieve the desired effect, but I wouldn&#x27;t trade it for anything.</li>
      <li>The more you spray on, the stronger the hold.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite hair spray.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay, but nothing special.</li>
      <li>It has great holding power, never flakes and actually makes your hair shiny.  </li>
      <li>but my daughter and husband enjoy this</li>
      <li>This freezing spray is one of the best I have ever found that gives the hair body without being stiff.</li>
      <li>This product is perfect for someone who wants their hair to stay in place all day long.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very fine mist, great for everyday but also can hold &amp;</li>
      <li>With this spray, I can style my hair so that it looks full and then hold that look in place with the freezing spray.  </li>
      <li>Glad to be able to get it thru Amazon at about the same price.</li>
      <li>Product is light but strong hold, not stiff or sticky</li>
      <li>It smells good and it has a strong hold, but it&#x27;s not too stiff.</li>
      <li>I love this product it holds well and look natural</li>
      <li>I have very, very straight hair and by putting my head upside down and spraying some, I get good effects, get compliments too.</li>
      <li>I am sensitive to strong fragrances and sometimes they give me a headache</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light weight but holds curls in straight hair well even in high humidity.</li>
      <li>I spray it on after curling and before brushing and it really adds volume too!</li>
      <li>When these products have been pulled from beauty salons, I look for them anywhere, including other States while visiting, so glad to have found them on Amazon - never thought of looking here!</li>
      <li>but really holds!</li>
      <li>I have been using Vavoom by Matrix Freezing Spray and Forming Gel for 20 yrs, and am always willing to try new products, but there simply is nothing better for me out there...</li>
      <li>The Freezing Spray is light, yet has a super not-your-grandma&#x27;s-salon-hold; skip the new spray with the red cover -</li>
      <li>I thought I would love this one given my normal daily hairspray is also by Matrix (design pulse)</li>
      <li>This is the softer hold I need for the more loose look and movable locks.</li>
      <li>in place very well.</li>
      <li>Holds my hair very well.</li>
      <li>can I dislike it so much.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Thanks, Amazon for always having what I neeed.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
      <li>I have very stubborn hair.</li>
      <li>Had to stop using this, it was just drying out my hair and scalp too much.</li>
      <li>Two cans of spray too much, you think??</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>I have super, mega thick hair and like a very strong hold product.  </li>
      <li>I think this would be enough if you had finer hair and didn&#x27;t want a precise hold, but for my medium short hair this just wasn&#x27;t strong enough to keep my style in place.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Too expensive but works great</li>
      <li>easily flattens it out or weighs it down.  </li>
      <li>And now that I have found it I do not want to live without it.  </li>
      <li>but this didn&#x27;t live up to my standards in any way.</li>
      <li>TRIED MANY OTHERS IN THE PAST...</li>
      <li>I needed some hairspray fast and Amazon did not have my usual as prime available that day, so</li>
      <li>hair is not stiff and gunky and holds my style.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not stiff or sticky.</li>
      <li>not stiff....</li>
      <li>It holds well and your hair still feels natural.</li>
      <li>My hair is naturally curly and frizzy</li>
      <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;I can buy locally, but much cheaper in price on Amazon so why go to the stores?</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Gives great body without sticky residue.</li>
    <li> Best freezing spray I have been able to find.  Live in rural USA.  Keeps my style all day.  Can even use it to add volume.</li>
    <li> Using it for years but this is the easiest way to buy it.</li>
    <li> My mom bought this home from a salon and she didn&#x27;t like it I asked her if I could have it and she said yes. I&#x27;ve been using it ever since then. I like this a lot. It holds really well especially when i put my hair in a scrunched messy bun but i don&#x27;t like the smell. I might switch to something else later on because of the price  and because of the smell but other than that no complaints here.  Hope this review helps anyone who reads it.   God bless :D</li>
    <li> Love this spray!! I have fine thin hair and this does not weigh it down. Not stiff or sticky. Best spray I&#x27;ve tried!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 9 years and love it!  My style will stay yet I can comb thru it.</li>
    <li> This is the best hairspray. not stiff.... but really holds!</li>
    <li> I ONLY USE THIS ON MY HAIR WHEN I PUT SPRAY IN MY HAIR I WILL B ORDERING AGAIN YES I LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I have thin and fine hair Vavoom freezing spray holds my style in place all day. Thanks.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best sprays I have ever used. It works so well and never has that build that other brands have had. It is a great product. I recommend it for all!</li>
    <li> my hairdresser uses this and said she can pick up a few cans for me when she shops at the hairproducts store. I pay LESS on Amazon that what she wanted to charge me. Great product</li>
    <li> I had a small sample of this spray so I wanted a bigger supply, I like it so far.  I have very, very straight hair and by putting my head upside down and spraying some, I get good effects, get compliments too.</li>
    <li> Again, the best Hair Spray on the market.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Dries fast &amp; firm &amp; dry….never tacky.  Expensive, but worth the money.  I buy it whenever I run out.  Never been disappointed.</li>
    <li> This hairspray is absolutely the best.  It has great holding power, never flakes and actually makes your hair shiny.  You can use a littIe or a lot, depending upon your hairstyle.  I have tried countless other products but never fail to return to vavoom freezing spray.  it seems like they changed the product a few years ago and you have to use more to achieve the desired effect, but I wouldn&#x27;t trade it for anything.</li>
    <li> it holds, smells good, makes the hair feel good not sticky. alittle pricey but my daughter and husband enjoy this</li>
    <li> My hairdresser introduced me to this spray and I must say it really holds if you don&#x27;t mind a little stiffness..  I spray it on after curling and before brushing and it really adds volume too!</li>
    <li> Get product for firm hold.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel stiff or sticky. It holds well and your hair still feels natural.</li>
    <li> It has literally taken me years to find a hairspray that doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair - but that actually lifts it up with body.  And this is IT!  I have a lot of very fine hair and product easily flattens it out or weighs it down.  But this hair spray does what I want it to do.  And now that I have found it I do not want to live without it.  I have ordered it three times and plan on reordering it as long as AOL carries it.</li>
    <li> I have super, mega thick hair and like a very strong hold product.  I had heard good things about Matrix&#x27; Vavoom Freezing Spray but have to say I&#x27;m slightly disappointed in the holding power.  I had to fortify this hold with another product which isn&#x27;t ideal as I don&#x27;t like having too much product in my hair.  I think this would be enough if you had finer hair and didn&#x27;t want a precise hold, but for my medium short hair this just wasn&#x27;t strong enough to keep my style in place.</li>
    <li> I have been using Vavoom by Matrix Freezing Spray and Forming Gel for 20 yrs, and am always willing to try new products, but there simply is nothing better for me out there... If you have thick to wavy hair, but prefer a natural look, these are the products for you. The Freezing Spray is light, yet has a super not-your-grandma&#x27;s-salon-hold; skip the new spray with the red cover - the smell is very strong - like stepping into a beauty salon... When these products have been pulled from beauty salons, I look for them anywhere, including other States while visiting, so glad to have found them on Amazon - never thought of looking here!</li>
    <li> Too expensive but works great</li>
    <li> I have been buying this hairspray for years at the hairdresser&#x27;s. Glad to be able to get it thru Amazon at about the same price. At my salon it is around $18.00.This hairspray has very good holding power without being sticky. The more you spray on, the stronger the hold. Sometimes over the years I have bought other hairsprays because I run out of this and can&#x27;t get to the salon, but have never had another that even comes close to this. They are either too sticky or not sticky enough or I don&#x27;t like the smell. This hairspray has a nice fragrance that is not overpowering. I am sensitive to strong fragrances and sometimes they give me a headache but this hairspray has a good, mild smell that does not trigger a headache for me. Also it goes on pretty dry but you do have several seconds to &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; with your hair before it completely dries.</li>
    <li> I have very stubborn hair. It is cut rather short but I have a lot of natural curl. My hair has a mind of its own and even sometimes resists a curling iron. Vavoom Freezing Spray does just what it claims- it freezes. I can place my stubborn hair where I want it, spray, and voila, it stays there.  I keep a spare can on hand because I don&#x27;t want to have to resort to using any other spray.  Love it.</li>
    <li> My favorite hairspray.  Holds my &amp;#34;skinny&amp;#34; hair in place all day!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, but nothing special. I wouldn&#x27;t order it again.</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is not stiff and gunky and holds my style.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used lots of other hairsprays and none of them work nearly as well.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t use anything else.  This is the best stuff for fine hair like mine.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Great Seller!</li>
    <li> it holds, smells good, makes the hair feel good not sticky.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t make my hair crinkly or stringy. It&#x27;s a very fine mist, great for everyday but also can hold &amp;#34;prom hair&amp;#34; in place very well. My hair stylist (aka: my aunt) uses it on all her clients. One bottle last quite a while.</li>
    <li> This is the softer hold I need for the more loose look and movable locks. I use the firm hold on the other areas. Two cans of spray too much, you think?? Not at all. Each has their purpose.</li>
    <li> The lid was broken with it arrived and I don&#x27;t believe the can was full -- it felt about half empty compared to others of the same size.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff!!!  Its Great Stuff.  It really gives you great hold and vollume!  I have tried them all this one is better!  LOL</li>
    <li> I bought this hair spray at the beauty shop I had gone to for years. after it closed I was unable to find the hair spray at other shops.&lt;br /&gt;It is a very good hair spray.  Holds the style without leaving my hair sticky.  Thanks, Amazon for always having what I neeed.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> It holds but your hair stays manageable.  I like the fragrance of the spray.  Good price, so I three each time I buy.</li>
    <li> This is a great spray to use as I have to use spray to hold my very fine hair.  This is a good spray that is not sticky and does not build up on my hair.  It is a firm hold and keeps my hair style in place all day.  I will continue to use this spray!</li>
    <li> Had to stop using this, it was just drying out my hair and scalp too much. Went back to my old product.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair spray.  Not too sticky and hard, but helps my hair stay in place all day.&lt;br /&gt;I can buy locally, but much cheaper in price on Amazon so why go to the stores?</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for someone who wants their hair to stay in place all day long. With no moisture involved unlike regular hairspray this product will not make your hair look plastic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands of hairspray, but I love Vavoom. It smells good and it has a strong hold, but it&#x27;s not too stiff.</li>
    <li> The hold on this spray works great. It&#x27;s light weight but holds curls in straight hair well even in high humidity.</li>
    <li> TRIED MANY OTHERS IN THE PAST...THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT THAT HOLDS AND DOES NOT RIP YOUR HAIR OUT WHEN YOU HAVE TO COMB THROUGH...</li>
    <li> Hair spray cans came banged up. I spent a lot of money; they should not arrive in that condition. I am embarassed to give it to someone as a gift,</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for many years. It keeps your hair in place but doesn&#x27;t feel stiff or sticky to the touch. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair spray I have ever used.  It goes on pretty stiff, but in less than an hour you can hardly feel that there is hairspray on my hair, yet it still holds.  It seems to brush out at night.</li>
    <li> Keeps the hold while you can run your fingers through your hair. Not sticky or stiff.</li>
    <li> used this to keep my granddaughters turnabout style in place. She still looked good at the end of the evening even though she has thick, heavy hair. The cap arrived cracked and won&#x27;t stay on, but the product is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I love this product it holds well and look natural</li>
    <li> Have used for several years. Holds my hair very well.HOPES TO HAVE ON THE MARKET MY LIFETIME BECAUSE IT WORKS SO WELL.</li>
    <li> This freezing spray is one of the best I have ever found that gives the hair body without being stiff.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff. She used to buy it all the time at the hairdresser and paid a lot more for it. It was good to find it on Amazon for a bunch cheaper.</li>
    <li> I needed some hairspray fast and Amazon did not have my usual as prime available that day, so I thought I would give this one a try since it had some nice reviews. This hairspray is comparable to a drugstore brand in my opinion, and it takes too long to dry. It provided very little hold and has an odd texture that leaves my thin hair feeling heavy and lifeless. I thought I would love this one given my normal daily hairspray is also by Matrix (design pulse) but this didn&#x27;t live up to my standards in any way. I don&#x27;t even think I&#x27;ll be finishing this can I dislike it so much.</li>
    <li> Its the best hairspray ive ever used. My hair is naturally curly and frizzy but when i use vavoom with a straightening iron you would never guess it and it doesnt flatten your hair down like a lot of other ones do.</li>
    <li> This is the best hairspray ever! I have tried other less expensive products and they were too sticky, had a very strong smell that stayed in your hair all day, and by the end of the day the style went completely flat.  I have fine hair that goes flat after a few hours. With this spray, I can style my hair so that it looks full and then hold that look in place with the freezing spray.  The spray holds the style all day yet keeps it looking natural and flexible, and NO STRONG SMELL left in your hair!  I have used this product for years and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> Love it! Always buy this many stores aren&#x27;t carrying this any longer. So as long as Amazon offers it I will be buying it!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Product is light but strong hold, not stiff or sticky</li>
