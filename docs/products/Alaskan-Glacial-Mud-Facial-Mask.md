      <li>I&#x27;m still working on the jars, which I use about once a month and the wonderful effects of the mask are the same.</li>
      <li>Love this product and makes my skin feel like silk.</li>
      <li>favorite part is washing the mask off.</li>
      <li>My mask was scented but I honestly just smelled a clean smell.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was able to pick all three scents for free after they were used as \\&quot;testers\\&quot; for a year at the shop I work at</li>
      <li>Very nice product , lives up to hype completely.  </li>
      <li>skin smooth to the touch.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so smooth and creamy.  </li>
      <li>It went on smooth and I just washed it off in the shower.</li>
      <li>was how smooth the mud</li>
      <li>My wife uses it daily and says its just great.</li>
      <li>I grew up in a scent free home and get lightheaded and a mild headache from being around strong scents like the laundry soap isle in the store, but this is so light smelling in comparison.&lt;br</li>
      <li>With my oily skin I enjoy how clean the skin is after using the mask.</li>
      <li>The mud is smooth and refreshing, and the unscented mask has a fresh, mild fragrance.</li>
      <li>I am 55 years old and using this product, my face never looked or felt better!  </li>
      <li>Did not see any difference and did not feel anything special.</li>
      <li>I love it, it really cleans and tightens my skin as well as makes it brighter.</li>
      <li>I love the smoothness of clay and the gentle tingle  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ready to use when you open the jar, which is of very nice quality I might add.</li>
      <li>love this product - have very sensitive skin and roseaca so can&#x27;t use anything with chemicals in it.</li>
      <li>Will most certainly be ordering this on a regular basis and friends can expect it for birthday gifts :)</li>
      <li>My skin looks SO MUCH BETTER - and the redness is fading daily - and the acne is almost completely gone for the first time in MONTHS!!!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so lightly exfoliating and rinses off very well leaving no residue.</li>
      <li>Soft, Smooth Skin after using!</li>
      <li>It is pricey but so worth it.</li>
      <li>It is buttery, creamy in texture and is a different kind of mud than I have ever felt before.  </li>
      <li>I RARELY review items, but I just had to chime in about this.</li>
      <li>The [[ASIN:B001MA7OIS facial brush]] is a handy tool for even application if you&#x27;d rather not use your fingers.</li>
      <li>Many skin blemishes could be helped with this deep clean mask.</li>
      <li>Feels so smooth and clean even tho it is &amp;#34;mud.&amp;#34;  Face felt really soft afterwards.  </li>
      <li>It does not have a strong perfume odor, just a mild, natural scent.</li>
      <li>right</li>
      <li>Easy to use and makes skin soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
      <li>My skin feels so soft, smooth, and refreshed after I use this mask.</li>
      <li>I found it at first to be tingly on my skin</li>
      <li>I first saw this item on Shark Tank and decided to try it.</li>
      <li>The merchant took a while to ship, once received, it is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I first discovered Alaska Glacial Mud Co while watching ABC&#x27;s Shark Tank, a show where entrepreneurs pitch their businesses to investors.</li>
      <li>Makes my face feel clean and soft.</li>
      <li>but this was amazing and left my skin feeling very refreshed and soft.</li>
      <li>It is nice mud mask, but definitely not worth almost $40.</li>
      <li>I have very oily skin</li>
      <li>this mask really did change my life.</li>
      <li>I have suffered from rosacea and adult onset acne for about two years, and have been on many different prescription medications to try and treat it.</li>
      <li>will be buying a new jar soon!</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I have used other clay masques but like this better since it seems natural</li>
      <li>Have noticed this really reduced the red blotchy appearance of his skin even after first use.</li>
      <li>Definitely a new staple in my skin care.</li>
      <li>&#x27;s the only draw back, you are excited to get purchase</li>
      <li>After 15 minutes and then washing away, my skin feels soft and refreshed.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never used anything that makes my skin this soft.</li>
      <li>order early.</li>
      <li>I use it once a week and the next day my skin looks plush and vibrant.</li>
      <li>Removed all the dead skin and left my skin silky smooth.</li>
      <li>The mud is also allergy-free and doesn&#x27;t cause irritation, which is key for me as I have sensitive skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Amazing mask.  It leaves your skin feeling refreshed and firmed, not dry or taught.  It does not have a strong perfume odor, just a mild, natural scent.</li>
    <li> my wife loves this stuff</li>
    <li> Very nice product , lives up to hype completely.  Awesome service from Amazon</li>
    <li> Makes your face feel smooth and luxurious afterward!</li>
    <li> I first discovered Alaska Glacial Mud Co while watching ABC&#x27;s Shark Tank, a show where entrepreneurs pitch their businesses to investors. I was intrigued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lauren, the founder of Alaska Glacial Mud, runs her mud business out of the small town of Cordova, Alaska, a quaint little city regarded as a hidden treasure. She&#x27;s also a commercial salmon fisherwoman, and she runs the fishing boat all by herself from the photos I&#x27;ve seen. My wife and I agree Lauren is one tough cookie! We also say she&#x27;s living the good life in beautiful Alaska.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently tried this purifying mud masque, harvested from the soft, buttery mud banks of the Copper River Delta in Alaska. Picture a serene, beautiful wilderness landscape with flowing rivers and no signs of humankind - that&#x27;s where your mud is coming from!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I love the masque! There are several different scents (I prefer the unscented) and you don&#x27;t need to add water or do any mixing. It&#x27;s ready to use when you open the jar, which is of very nice quality I might add. The jar is thick glass and feels solid in my hands. Nice packaging too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mud detoxifies and softens my skin, and I prefer to focus my application on and around my nose where my pores are biggest. The [[ASIN:B001MA7OIS facial brush]] is a handy tool for even application if you&#x27;d rather not use your fingers. The mud is also allergy-free and doesn&#x27;t cause irritation, which is key for me as I have sensitive skin. I have to be careful with creams and the like. After 15 minutes and then washing away, my skin feels soft and refreshed.</li>
    <li> I was not impressed with this product. I&#x27;ll stick to my dead sea mask. This showed no results and has no special feel to it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after seeing it on SharkTank.  While SharkTank declined the product I thought I would give it a try because I was impressed with the back story of the product.  Well to make a long story short, my family noticed the difference right away.&lt;br /&gt;My adult daughters came over to try the Glacial Mud Facial Mask and they also had a noticeable firmness and smoothness in their skin.  Then a teenager grand daughter gave it a try and she loves it also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very nice product.  I found it at first to be tingly on my skin but my kids did not.  It is buttery, creamy in texture and is a different kind of mud than I have ever felt before.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I seriously like this. Should come with a brush to apply it though.</li>
    <li> You have to  buy this.. It makes  your face so clean, wonderful, tighter, a must have item.Love it, Love it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after having seen it on Shark Tank. Amazon&#x27;s marketplace (Spa Spa) had the best price because shipping was free. The mud is smooth and refreshing, and the unscented mask has a fresh, mild fragrance.</li>
    <li> This stuff made my acne go away!! Just when I thought nothing worked.....this mask really did change my life. I use it once a week and the next day my skin looks plush and vibrant. It is pricey but so worth it. Try it and you will love it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.Makes my skin feel better and looksbetter.I have used other clay masques but like this better since it seems natural</li>
    <li> love this product - have very sensitive skin and roseaca so can&#x27;t use anything with chemicals in it. I use 1x a week and it&#x27;s perfect. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a product like this for years.  The merchant took a while to ship, once received, it is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I first saw this item on Shark Tank and decided to try it. I&#x27;ve only used it once so far but my skin did feel softer and refreshed. It went on smooth and I just washed it off in the shower. Loved the way it made my skin feel.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this mask! My skin feels so soft, smooth, and refreshed after I use this mask. I have very oily skin and it helps reduce my shine. So glad I saw this on Shark Tank!</li>
    <li> I have combination oily and dry skin that can be sensitive. Clay masks usually dry me out (especially in the winter) but this was amazing and left my skin feeling very refreshed and soft. The container is small but dont be discouraged, I only needed a thin layer so this should last me for some time. I also feel like this helped to control my oily skin and balanced it out. Will most certainly be ordering this on a regular basis and friends can expect it for birthday gifts :)</li>
    <li> My wife uses it daily and says its just great. It has her face smoother and shining--my daughter has taken it from her and also uses it--now i have two muddy women.</li>
    <li> Bought this after seeing it on Shark Tank. Have used it some but my teenage son has been using it on his skin. He has sensitive skin and is prone to breakouts so harsher products often make his skin worse. Have noticed this really reduced the red blotchy appearance of his skin even after first use. Have to watch him so he doesn&#x27;use it too often as results were so good.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mask.  It&#x27;s so smooth and creamy.  Saw it on Shark Tank and I&#x27;m happy I bought it.  It makes your face so smooth!</li>
    <li> I have suffered from rosacea and adult onset acne for about two years, and have been on many different prescription medications to try and treat it. I received my mud about 10 days ago and have used it 5 times since then (once every other day). My skin looks SO MUCH BETTER - and the redness is fading daily - and the acne is almost completely gone for the first time in MONTHS!!!! I RARELY review items, but I just had to chime in about this. Definitely a new staple in my skin care.</li>
    <li> Saw this product on Shark Tank.  Absolutely loved it.  Would definitely purchase again.  I would definitely buy this product if it was offered in a spa.</li>
    <li> Love this product! My face feels wonderful after I use it and lasts all week.</li>
    <li> I think it is over priced. Did not see any difference and did not feel anything special. It is nice mud mask, but definitely not worth almost $40.</li>
    <li> I am delighted with this product.  Great exfoliater .  It did not leave my face blotchy .Leaves skin smooth to the touch.</li>
    <li> I love the product.&lt;br /&gt;It hoes on very smooth.  My mask was scented but I honestly just smelled a clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;The only think I noticed above all other mask was how smooth the mud is.&lt;br /&gt;It is honestly the softest thing, I know that sounds strange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very slow shipping!!!&lt;br /&gt;It took nearly a month, if not more to get.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s the only draw back, you are excited to get purchase and I waited, and waited...and waited.&lt;br /&gt;Just order early. I would buy again and as a gift.</li>
    <li> This is one rockin&#x27; product.  I am 55 years old and using this product, my face never looked or felt better!  When they use the term &amp;#34;buttery&amp;#34; they mean it.  It is luscious!  I&#x27;m going to be ordering samples for everyone I know!!</li>
    <li> Love it.  Makes my face feel clean and soft.</li>
    <li> I love it, it really cleans and tightens my skin as well as makes it brighter.</li>
    <li> I love these mud masks! I was able to pick all three scents for free after they were used as \\&quot;testers\\&quot; for a year at the shop I work at..that was 2 years ago. I&#x27;m still working on the jars, which I use about once a month and the wonderful effects of the mask are the same. I love the smoothness of clay and the gentle tingle  I feel as it dries. The scents are not overwhelming at all. I grew up in a scent free home and get lightheaded and a mild headache from being around strong scents like the laundry soap isle in the store, but this is so light smelling in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part is washing the mask off. It&#x27;s so lightly exfoliating and rinses off very well leaving no residue. The final result is firm, soft, and pure feeling skin!&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying a new jar soon!</li>
    <li> I saw the gal that started this company on Shark Tank and I was super impressed so I bought this Mud Facial Mask and wow, it was wonderful!  My skin was so smooth and felt so good when I was done!  It does a great job of moisturizing too.  I also bought the brush and it worked great for applying this to my face.  What an awesome product and I would definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> Feels so smooth and clean even tho it is &amp;#34;mud.&amp;#34;  Face felt really soft afterwards.  Saw this on Shark Tank.  It is a little bit expensive, but it does feel good.</li>
    <li> With my oily skin I enjoy how clean the skin is after using the mask. Many skin blemishes could be helped with this deep clean mask.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and makes skin soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom. I&#x27;ve never used anything that makes my skin this soft.</li>
    <li> Love this product and makes my skin feel like silk.</li>
    <li> I love this Product! I will Definitely Reorder Again!  Soft, Smooth Skin after using! Love the feel of this Mask!&lt;br /&gt;Makes ya want to head to Alaska and play in the MUD!!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful mask! Removed all the dead skin and left my skin silky smooth. LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
    <li> Loved it, would recommend to everyone.</li>
