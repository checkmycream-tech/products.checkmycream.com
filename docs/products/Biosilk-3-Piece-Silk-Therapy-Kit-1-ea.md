    <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I have  naturaly curly hair and straighten it a lot too. So my hair craves a lot of moisture. Biosilk is my hairs new best friend, haha. No more frizz like or dry looking hair and/or curls. Also the silk therepy is geat for using heat styling  tools. Or just to add extra moisture. I don&#x27;t plan  to use anything else. I&#x27;ve found my match, haha. Would definitely recommend and buy again.</li>

    <li> Product arrived fairly quick! I love the set I immediately seen results with the shampoo and conditioner the smell was a plus and the biosilk therapy serum works wonders. I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Great deal, I love bio silk!</li>

    <li> This is an excellent product, especially the leave in hair therapy! Hands down!!! My hair stylist uses it on her customers!  I WILL be purchasing this again!</li>
    <li> I had bought this before primarily for the Biosilk hair treatment. The previous purchase was a much larger bottle&lt;br /&gt;of the hair oil treatment. I was really disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using bio silk for about 3 years now and haven&#x27;t looked back. As I got older I started worrying about male pattern baldness so I began taking better care of my hair.  Now I use quality hair products and take a biotin supplement. Sure this stuff is expensive, but honestly you have to ask yourself if you feel having full healthy hair on your head is worth it. To me it was a no brainer.</li>
    <li> Nothing, and I mean nothing smells as good as this. AND I have dry hair due to dying it blonde... this product silkens my hair in a way I didn&#x27;t expect.&lt;br /&gt;Love it and even though the cost has gone up exponentially from the first time I purchased it, I will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> Authentic product, GREAT PRICE because the silk therapy is 20+ alone for the size it includes. Slow shipping though with 2 day prime it took over a week.</li>
