      <li>I HAVE VERY SENSITIVE SKIN, BUT</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is the volcanic ash or whatever, but I have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Makes my skin so soft.</li>
      <li>I get fairly regular deep tissue massages and began to notice that (I think) the oil from the massage was sometimes causing my upper back/neck/shoulders to breakout just a bit, even if I tried to bath quickly afterwards.</li>
      <li>I recently got a sample of the Detox products at my local Whole Foods store.</li>
      <li>I gave to a teen who said it helped clear their acne.</li>
      <li>I have tried every pharmaceutical product prescribed to man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave up on using pharmaceutical products on my skin, most of his suggestions made my skin worse.</li>
      <li>This really cleans my face without drying it out like other products I have used.</li>

    <li> Nice shower gel! It smells nice, although not what I expected a charcoal shower gel to smell like, but not disappointing, either. It lathers very well, too, and leaves me feeling clean.  I&#x27;m a shower gel addict- I currenty have a couple dozen kinds in my shower, and more under the sink. I will buy this again, although maybe not until I&#x27;ve used up some of the lesser body washes.  8^)</li>

    <li> I love this body wash because it doesn&#x27;t have the sulfates as other soaps. As a result I have no allergic reactions.</li>

    <li> Clean and fresh.  D-tox is a special benefit</li>
    <li> This smells great! I use it on my face and hair also. I don&#x27;t know if it is the volcanic ash or whatever, but I have sensitive skin. This really cleans my face without drying it out like other products I have used.</li>
    <li> Love the smell,like how it feels. I use this product, the body scrub and black bar soap. Great products. If a young adult has &amp;#34;backne &amp;#34;or broken out anywhere else on body- try this- I gave to a teen who said it helped clear their acne.</li>

    <li> love it, continue to buy and use it</li>
    <li> I have problems with my skin; facial blemishes and psoriasis patches on my elbows and knees.  I have tried every pharmaceutical product prescribed to man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave up on using pharmaceutical products on my skin, most of his suggestions made my skin worse. I got tired of all of the stares from people at work and while walking down the street, so I started to look in other areas to try the natural drug free method.  I have tried all types of soap: African black soap, Shea butter soap, Tea Tree oil, you name it.  I did some research online and activated charcoal was mentioned in an article for its skin purifying qualities, so I decided to try it out, what could I loose, my face was already looking a complete mess, what the heck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to October 2013:&lt;br /&gt;Detox - step one is the miracle cure for my problem skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After one week of using this product my skin is back to its natural luster and is blemish free.  Yes, you read it correctly BLEMISH FREE.  I could not be more satisfied.</li>
    <li> I DIDNT ORDER THE BODY WASH; I ORDERED THE FACIAL WASH AND AMAZON GOT THE ORDER CONFUSED.  SO AS SOON AS I GET THE STEP TWO I ORDERED I WILL TRY IT; IF IT IS LIKE OTHER GIOVANNI PRODUCTS THEN I CAN CHANGE MY FEEDBACK THEN.  I TRIED THIS WITH THE REST OF THE GIOVANNI DTOX SYSTEM LINE AND IT WAS TERRIFIC. I HAVE VERY SENSITIVE SKIN, BUT THIS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE STEP TWO OF THE BODY PRODUCT WORK WELL TOGETHER.  SINCE I ALREADY USE KORRES; I WOULD USE THIS ONCE A WEEK.  STEP TWO IS MORE OF A SCRUB BUT NOT OVERLY GRAINY AND I FEEL NOT ONLY CLEAN AFTERWARD BUT NOT GREASY OR HAVING TIGHT SKIN.  GIOVANNI PRODUCTS DO WHAT THEY SAY THEY WILL DO.  I USE THE DTOX SYSTEM FOR MY FACE AND NOW I HAVE THE DTOX SYSTEM FOR MY BODY.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any benefit from using this product and yet I used it all the same. Some people may notice a difference, I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.. it acts both antibacterial and mouisturizes.... then it exfoliates.... and it detoxes and nuetralizes at the same time.  Once you get over putting black sludge on your face or body.  Which is funnier than the green mud in a way.. its a wonderful very different product.  It clears up acme and skin rashes... and settles down red face blotches and that inflammation feeling. I was so impressed I bought another bottle before I ran out to make sure I didn&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> I get fairly regular deep tissue massages and began to notice that (I think) the oil from the massage was sometimes causing my upper back/neck/shoulders to breakout just a bit, even if I tried to bath quickly afterwards. I started reading about charcoal cleansers and I use a charcoal face sponge when washing my face that seems to help keep breakouts at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product had good reviews, so I gave it a try. I really like it and think it has helped to clarify my skin after a massage or a day when I&#x27;m sweating heavily during yard work in the middle of a Texas summer. The smell is pleasant...not too perfume-ish but doesn&#x27;t smell bad either. It foams up pretty well, which I prefer in a body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed when I use it, my skin feels cleaner and I avoid any breakouts on my upper body. At the same time, I haven&#x27;t noticed that it&#x27;s overly drying so that&#x27;s a bonus as well. I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> Works really well as a body wash.  If you run out of face wash, there is a reason Giovanni makes a separate line for the face, this stuff is too powerful.  I will not repeat that mistake.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this! My skin feels smooth and polished and it&#x27;s helping with the sweet case of backne that I was lucky enough to develop in my mid 40&#x27;s. Woot!</li>
    <li> Only complaint is that cap is difficult to open, especially with wet hands. Lathers well and rinses easily. Unobtrusive fragrance. Would order again.</li>
    <li> A gentle but effective exfoliator.  I used it about twice a week.  Don&#x27;t really have anything else to add to this.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Offered here at the same price as Whole Foods where I first purchased this line.</li>
    <li> My daughter was given a sample from her nanna and her acne is so much better than using proactive</li>
    <li> Makes my skin so soft.</li>
    <li> Good product but cheaper at Ross</li>
