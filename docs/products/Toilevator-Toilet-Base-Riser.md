      <li>Very nice looking instead of all the extra seats that also need</li>
      <li>Surprising what a difference adding 3.5 inches to a toilet makes in giving more independence.</li>
      <li>This thing is great because you can use your toilet the way it was meant to be used.</li>
      <li>This is a great product for bringing the heights of your toilet up.  </li>
      <li>this is great makes toilet a lot easier</li>
      <li>The install was quick and easy.  </li>
      <li>Installation wasn&#x27;t as quick and easy as others suggest, but it&#x27;s doable.</li>
      <li>An absolutely perfect solution to the need for an ADA compliant toilet without having to buy a new one.</li>
      <li>but he used the real rubber ring purchased from a hardware store for a buck fifty to make sure there was no leaking.</li>
      <li>white and now it matches and it looks good.</li>
      <li>Other than the color, the riser works great.</li>
      <li>Our son is handicapped and this helps tremendously</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super.  </li>
      <li>Everything went well and quickly.</li>
      <li>unless you have a REALLY handy man, it&#x27;s worth the money to have a plumber install it professionally.  </li>
      <li>This is much more stable them the seat things that sit on top and are fastened at the back, those seem to slide around.</li>
      <li>Third - This is the best solution I have seen for raising a toilet.</li>
      <li>After having spent many times more what I paid for this product, I&#x27;m glad I accidentally \\&quot;discovered \\&quot; it while \\&quot;flipping\\&quot; through the \\&quot;pages\\&quot; of the Amazon.com \\&quot;catalog\\&quot;-it has been a real blessing.  </li>
      <li>Our Plummer said it was easy to install and very sturdy.</li>
      <li>For me personally, it&#x27;s the best money I ever spent.  </li>
      <li>really just looks like part of the original fixture.</li>
      <li>I find it just right when I am wearing shoes.</li>
      <li>I bought one for the toilet in one of our other bathrooms a year ago and it is wonderful!  </li>
      <li>When I am barefoot it is just a tad too high to be comfortable.</li>
      <li>well I have three from three different vendors and two were beige and one a very light purple.  </li>
      <li>great, low cost way to raise toilet or bidet</li>
      <li>Thank you so much!</li>
      <li>and he was dubious at first.  </li>
      <li>and my arthritic knees feel so much better with the extra height</li>
      <li>My aging parents (who suffer from arthritis only) LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>I had this installed while the workers were putting in an accessible shower - what a small price to pay to make my life more convenient!</li>
      <li>I have a back problem and this way my legs are able to touch the floor</li>
      <li>So a trip to the hardware store for stainless bolts and nuts and a bit of work with the grinder created the right head design and shorten the bolts.  </li>
      <li>After leaving rehab I had a plastic seat riser that attached to the top of my toilet</li>
      <li>The toilet seat that most people use can become contaminated over time, therefore, having to be replaced time and again.</li>
      <li>Since the extension is plastic, spray can white for plastic was a good match, and hopefully will stay on the Chinese made plastic.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> We installed this in a medical facility where we see a lot of elderly patients. Our Plummer said it was easy to install and very sturdy. We have had 2 patients who were not very tall, felt uncomfortable because their feet did not touch the floor. But over all it seems to be a great addition to our facilities.</li>
    <li> Very easy to install and worked great.  I thought that it was a little over priced but other than that, I will probably get another one for my other bathroom.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product after reading all the reviews. I found it very sturdy and easy to install with just a few hand tools. The whole process took less than an hour. I recommend this product as a much better alternative to the raised toilet seats and less expensive than replacing the entire toilet.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It was simple to install, directions are good, and works great!  My knees are happy with the new height!  I only had slight knee discomfort before, but now have no discomfort!</li>
    <li> I bought one for the toilet in one of our other bathrooms a year ago and it is wonderful!  It was easy to install and had no problems at all with it. We like it so much that I bought one for my other bathroom that I am remodeling right after the holidays.  I would like to add though that the water line that was on my toilet will not work with the toilevator.  I had to go out and get another (longer) supply line but it was readily available at Home Depot.  I think it should be added to the kit and of course charge an extra $8 or so for the kit with the longer supply line included. If the longer hose was included, I would have rated it at 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I like this item. it came with everything needed to install it and use it except basic hand tools.  It installed easy and works well. It looks good also. I might get another one for the other toilet in the house.</li>
    <li> This was and still is a Life Saver</li>
    <li> So here&#x27;s the problem: The longer bolts supplied to fasten the plastic extension (riser) and the toilet to the floor are steel, not brass or stainless steel. If you ever want to remove the extension or replace the toilet, you&#x27;re going to find a mass of rusted metal. So a trip to the hardware store for stainless bolts and nuts and a bit of work with the grinder created the right head design and shorten the bolts.  Second was the extension&#x27;s color, a cold white that doesn&#x27;t match the typical warm white porcelain toilet.  Since the extension is plastic, spray can white for plastic was a good match, and hopefully will stay on the Chinese made plastic.  In terms of value, the kit ought to be about $35.  Again,  it&#x27;s a great idea for someone with bad knees, but for the price charged, the extension should be made of porcelain, with brass bolts.</li>
    <li> My mom is 79 and suffers from multiple forms of arthritis.  She has used a plastic seat riser for years.  They slide, are very unattractive, and very hard to clean.  My dad did not want to purchase an ADA toilet, but she wanted something more like a regular toilet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seemed to be a good compromise.  My brother easily installed it, and both of my parents are pleased.  The color is not the same white as the actual commode, but that is not a problem.  Also, my brother installed the pedestal backwards so that she would not trip over the base, and it works great.</li>
    <li> When my elderly mother moved in, we had to make our powder room toilet usable for her, yet make it acceptable for others. Yes, it takes a while to install, but then you have an ADA compliant toilet for $89. It&#x27;s certainly more sanitary and attractive than the raised or removable seats. It&#x27;s ingenious. It&#x27;s been 3 years since installation, and it still looks and works fine.</li>
    <li> This product was easily installed [we had the plumbers do it because none of us here could do it, but   they said it could easily done by a \\&quot;handyman\\&quot; type person].  My husband is 6&#x27;5\\&quot; and in a wheelchair.  Transferring was hard on his weak legs.  By making the toilet near his wheelchair height, transferring has become much easier and he is very pleased.</li>
    <li> Perfect for those of us with bad knees!</li>
    <li> I had a plumber put mine in and he was dubious at first.  By the time he got done, he asked if he could take photos to show other customers because he was impressed.  It&#x27;s plenty sturdy and has been a real boon for me.  Mine was a pale blue color, so be warned if that&#x27;s an issue and you need it painted.  It came with almost everything, including two wax rings and the soil pipe extension and hardware.  The plumber used his sealant around the edges.  Took less than one hour to install.</li>
    <li> This thing is great because you can use your toilet the way it was meant to be used. There is no ugly plastic seat that is hard to clean, it&#x27;s just your toilet only higher! My husband installed it but he used the real rubber ring purchased from a hardware store for a buck fifty to make sure there was no leaking. There IS NO leaking!  You will need to install grab bars though, if needed.</li>
    <li> Before you purchase this product measure the base of your toilet. Mine was 26 1/2 inches and this product did not work.There is another product out there that was not even offered called the Toilevator Grande.I am now stuck with this product aand have to buy the other one somewhere else. Beware !!!!</li>
    <li> I live in Panama and it is not easy to find a higher toilet that has the same holes the same distance from a wall as the existing toilet. Plus the toilets here are made for small people. This product solved the problem and was easy to install. Now when I poop, I don&#x27;t feel like I am squatting on a hole, plus since the toilet is higher, It is hard to miss it when I pee. No more wet spots around the toilet. My knees feel much better also. The bowl rim is now 17 1/2 inches from the floor.</li>
    <li> Product worked as described but I ordered a white unit and received a biscuit colored one. Also the kit includes a longer flex line which is needed, saving me $7.00.  A good thing. The wax rings are the cheapy thin ones, I had to install the extra thick ones. One more comment, if you have a Kohler toilet, the base of toilet is larger than the toiletvator. Buy the larger king size model toiletvator. Final word: This product really works!</li>
    <li> I bought this item to help me get on and off my tolet easier and it works. Since I have lower back and knee problem getting on the tolet was terrible for me due to my pain and also feeling like I was falling because my tolet is a standard low tolet. After installing the Toilevator my life has become much easier and safer getting on and off the tolet. I also do not feel as though I am going to fall since my tolet has been raised 3 1/2 inches.This product comes with eveything you need to install , easy to read directions, and best of all no trips back and forth to the hard ward stores for parts.[[ASIN:B000GFAXWO Toilevator Toilet Base Riser]]( include my quote)</li>
    <li> After having spent many times more what I paid for this product, I&#x27;m glad I accidentally \\&quot;discovered \\&quot; it while \\&quot;flipping\\&quot; through the \\&quot;pages\\&quot; of the Amazon.com \\&quot;catalog\\&quot;-it has been a real blessing.  We went through a regular rise every three months and with he price rising (no pun intended) each time we got a new one, I was glad to find this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only recommendation:  unless you have a REALLY handy man, it&#x27;s worth the money to have a plumber install it professionally.  (Be prepared for hysterical laughter from the plumbers who have never heard of it!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, since we have a handicapped toilet which is higher anyway, you need to measure and make sure it won&#x27;t make it too high for you.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the tall persons cure for squatting! It was fairly easy to install. And looks just fine. We are so grateful for the extra 3 inches.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for both my bathrooms when my mom &amp; brother were going to live with me.  Later, when they needed to move to an assisted living facility, I had them installed there because the toilets were so low.  The facility had put the more common risers on the top of the bowl, but they are very unstable &amp; uncomfortable.  These are not even noticeable and the user gets to sit on a normal, extremely secure toilet seat. Unless someone is looking for them, they don&#x27;t even know this is a specially equipped toilet.  AND it is comfortable for the other members of the family.  They are a wonderful invention.</li>
    <li> It is great!  No more having to find something to pull ourselves up off a stool that is too low.  Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Just what I expected. The install was quick and easy.  Made a world of difference!  I would recommend this product to anyone that is wanting to raise their toilet.</li>
    <li> Severe arthritis.  Bones are soft and brittle.  Rising from a lower sitting position was getting to be impossible.  Bought a 4&amp;#34; riser seat from a local medical supply store.  Bated it.  Wobbled and leaned with you.  Difficult to keep clean and the size dictated you had to clean in the tub.  Was looking for a replacement on Amazon and saw this riser base to install under the toilet.  Finish matches my white toilet.  Extension lines and longer screws/bolts included with detailed, easy instructions.  It is absolutely a great solution to my problem.</li>
    <li> This was easy to install and a perfect solution for my Grandmother. The price was reasonable, and she would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> The kit comes with everything included to perform the installation yourself. I found this product to be a much better solution than a seat riser, and is also more stable for the user. It was not as hard as I thought it would be to do the install, and it should be just as easy to remove it if the need ever arises. I was impressed by this product, and with the fact that it is an all-in-one kit with everything you would need included.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to install and makes a world of difference for someone who has limited mobility.  Surprising what a difference adding 3.5 inches to a toilet makes in giving more independence.</li>
    <li> great, low cost way to raise toilet or bidet</li>
    <li> As a disabled person I purchased two of these.  For me personally, it&#x27;s the best money I ever spent.  If I had purchased a high-rise toilet, the cheapest one was $364 and I needed two.  I had a plumber do the install and would recommend that if you are not extremely handy to leave it to the professionals.  All in all I figure I saved about $600 over buying new toilets.  The base is very sturdy, the color matched perfectly and they are not obtrusive. In my opinion, it is easier to step down than to try to lift yourself up.  Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I had this installed while the workers were putting in an accessible shower - what a small price to pay to make my life more convenient!</li>
    <li> After carefully reading and following the instructions, I was not impressed with the stability of the toilet. I had concerns for the user being safe on the unit. As I feared, I was called back to re-secure the toilet, as it was leaking. I am still not sure this was a good solution to elevate the toilet, I would prefer a taller one piece toilet, rather than a separate riser. Keeping my fingers crossed that it holds up.&lt;br /&gt;Lee (retired contractor)</li>
    <li> I have this under a taller then normal toilet and it is a very good height for me. The person who installed it for me seemed to have no problem understanding the instructions.</li>
    <li> Ordered 2 Toilevators a few years ago.  They were very White in color.  Decided recently I needed another-- well I have three from three different vendors and two were beige and one a very light purple.  I have another on the way which is supposed to be white but \\&quot;might have a bluish tint\\&quot;.  The quality control for this manufacturer is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know these Toilevators can be painted--so they say, however, it is easier to paint from white rather than a color--and even though I was told by all the vendors the Toilevator is white, you won&#x27;t know what pastel shade you will receive until it arrives.  Since my tile floor and commode are white, I wanted white.  Very aggravating.  Quality control, quality control, quality control is needed by the the manufacturer.  Ordering an item like the Toilevator should be a simple, uncomplicated process--not difficult and aggravating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Toilevator itself is a great idea, just don&#x27;t expect it to be white even though the vendor states in the description that the color is white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot; easy toilet riser\\&quot; by Medway Corp. Is white. and it is US made.  Haven&#x27;t tried it yet but am placing an order for one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three stars for  Horrible quality control  in maintaining true White color.</li>
    <li> We loved the 1st one. We purchased another for the other bathroom. Our son is handicapped and this helps tremendously</li>
    <li> As advertised. Thanks</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this if you have a disabled person in your house hold. This is much more stable them the seat things that sit on top and are fastened at the back, those seem to slide around. This a lot better and if you don&#x27;t have the taller toilet this will give you a little more height.</li>
    <li> I am partially disabled.  This riser makes a big difference for my life style.</li>
    <li> The Toilet Elevator worked.&lt;br /&gt;It does what it says but it was not white. The color was antique white. They advertised white but it isn&#x27;t. I had to spray paint&lt;br /&gt;it white and now it matches and it looks good. Other than the color, the riser works great. It the color matched, I would have given it a 5 star.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for bringing the heights of your toilet up.  Especially easy for our maintenance people to install.</li>
    <li> This toilet raiser works very well but in all 3 I have installed the toilet and toilet base riser were not secure on the floor. The base slipped around on the floor easily twisting and the toilet twisted around on the base. A bead of calk between the base and the floor and the toilet and the base and every thing is solid fixed in place and water tight. It works very well just caulk it down.</li>
    <li> this is great makes toilet a lot easier</li>
    <li> works like a charm...</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my mom who is elderly. The 3.5 inches of extra height make it much less of a strain for her to sit and then stand back up. We do have handles bought separately which installed with no extra height under the original seat. I would recommend for anyone disabled or unsteady.&lt;br /&gt;The Toilevator is very well made and fit the base of the American Standard elongated toilet perfectly without sticking out at all. I assume the regular round toilet would look like it does in the picture with the little edge in front. Still its unobtrusive and was easy to install with the hardware and instructions in the box.&lt;br /&gt;It really just looks like part of the original fixture. We prefer that to the medical looking plastic seats. I would recommend making sure this is not too tall for your use. If 3.5 inches seems too high there are other options in the under seat risers. However this fit the bill perfectly. I do wish they&#x27;d make it in varying heights as it was almost too tall. I believe it only comes in one color as well. But its a great product. Very nice looking instead of all the extra seats that also need cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;A wax seal (purchase separately) will be needed as whenever you remove and reseat or replace a toilet.</li>
    <li> I have had a knee replacement and find the base riser is cheaper and just as good as putting in a handicap toilet for ease of standing up. This is the second one I have as I put on in different houses.  Safe and comfortable.  others don&#x27;t seem to mind using it.</li>
    <li> Over priced but does what I wanted  I have double knee replacement and low toliets are a problem.</li>
    <li> An absolutely perfect solution to the need for an ADA compliant toilet without having to buy a new one.</li>
    <li> I can give this product a high recommendation. It looks great and has helped my mom a lot. Two thumbs up.</li>
    <li> It is so nice having another 3.5&amp;#34; in height. My chiropractor says it&#x27;s good for my hips and spine as well as my knees. Before I found this, I was having a great deal of difficulty finding a toilet that would be tall enough that wasn&#x27;t hugely expensive. This was a great money saver, and I recommend it highly. One of the things I like about it is that if you don&#x27;t need to put the extra surface in front as a step/footrest, you can install it to the back.</li>
    <li> No more then having my knees hitting my shoulders. I have a back problem and this way my legs are able to touch the floor</li>
    <li> easy to install (for my my husband, a retired maintenance man) and my arthritic knees feel so much better with the extra height</li>
    <li> The tolivator is a very good product. The plumber, who wad doubtfull about the product at first, found it easy to install and liked it a lot at the end. My wife really likes it and I really like it a lot too.</li>
    <li> This is such a wonderful product.  It is almost unnoticable when installed.  The time to install is about 30 minutes. I would highly recommend this product to anyone.  The toilet seat that most people use can become contaminated over time, therefore, having to be replaced time and again. So be smart and stop adding more cost to your home expenses,simply purchase this wonderful Toilevator, and put out the money only once.</li>
    <li> I did not receive this item for 3 weeks and I needed a taller toilet before it ever arrived. I solved the problem by simply installing a taller toilet, which didn&#x27;t cost much more than your product. I did not use the toilet riser. I will add that I was disappointed the color did not match our existing toilet and I did not see any choices. I assumed it would be white. I am no doubt happier with installing the new toilet but regret the wasted time and money spent waiting for your product.</li>
    <li> Installed  easily and works good.  Nice product.  The best way to get a higher toilet.</li>
    <li> It was an easy install and the price was good.It has been a great aide to the person I installed it for.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s super.  Great height.  Easy to install.  Blends beautifully with the toilet.  I love it.</li>
    <li> My aging parents (who suffer from arthritis only) LOVE this product. A friend of theirs wants one too now. It&#x27;s much more discreet than something that&#x27;s placed over the seat, and it doesn&#x27;t get in the way of your feet. Makes it easier for them, without extra cleaning than normal, and without any embarrassment. Installation wasn&#x27;t as quick and easy as others suggest, but it&#x27;s doable.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these (from another source) back in 2003, when my mother had a hip replacement. As other reviewers have noted, the usual assist of an elevated toilet seat on the toilet is awkward, hard to clean, and unstable. I wanted something that would be unobtrusive, help my mom, and not be noticed by company. The Toilevator fit the bill perfectly. I had no difficulty at all installing it by myself. You can choose which end to use as the front, which is helpful if the toilet is in a tight spot, or you prefer one end for appearance&#x27;s sake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This turned out to be one of those products you buy for a specific need but end up wishing you&#x27;d had in use all along. My mother did find it immensely helpful, but so have I. Anyone who is feeling stiff and sore after a lot of physical exertion will be thankful they don&#x27;t have to bend those knees and sore muscles very much to use the toilet. Tall people just find it more comfortable. In fact, this is one of the few things in my house that I can count on getting favorable comments about from all of my guests. It never fails - people who use my bathroom end up mentioning how much nicer my higher-sitting toilet is, and ask where they can get this \\&quot;toilet platform\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long review short: I highly endorse this product, and I can personally attest that it is well made and holds up well over a long period of time, as I&#x27;ve had mine for nine years now. The only drawback: the plastic has yellowed a bit over time. It&#x27;s now an ivory-yellow tone. That&#x27;s no problem for me, since the toilet is tucked into an alcove in the bathroom where the lighting doesn&#x27;t call attention to the Toilevator. I only notice it when I&#x27;m down on my knees washing the bathroom floor. Would I buy this product again? Absolutely. And now I&#x27;m off to email this link to my friends who keep asking where they can get one for their bathrooms.</li>
    <li> Worked great. I installed a Hyundai Bidet which this unit made  possible.Product was easy to&lt;br /&gt;install and made for a very stable toilet</li>
    <li> I am six foot tall and after having had two stokes I found that standing from any low sitting furniture to be very difficult. After leaving rehab I had a plastic seat riser that attached to the top of my toilet and it sucked! I found this on the internet and Amazon had the best price I could find so I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is made of plastic and supports 500 lbs according to the documentation. The plastic shell has webbed ribs to make it stronger. The kit includes everything needed to install it. I had mine installed by a plumber due to my condition. Everything went well and quickly. Having had it now for several weeks I have these observations to make. First - my toilet is not as sturdy as it was when sitting on my concrete slab. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it is not in any way wobbly or dangerous, it is just not as sturdy as it was before. This may be due to irregularities in my floor. But I still feel that if it were made of some stronger material it would be better! Second - at six foot tall I find it just right when I am wearing shoes. When I am barefoot it is just a tad too high to be comfortable. Given how hard it is too stand up when it was lower, I would take &amp;#34;too high&amp;#34; any day of the week!! So even if I were shorter I would still choose this over the normal toilet height. Third - This is the best solution I have seen for raising a toilet. The plastic seats that attach to the top of the bowl look ugly, keep the lid from working, require more time when cleaning, and generally put off anyone else who uses it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is money well spent, even if I did have to add the cost of a plumber to install it.  :o)</li>
