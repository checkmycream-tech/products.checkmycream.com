      <li>LOVE.)</li>
      <li>I really do love it.</li>

      <li>However, the volume and surprising quality of this wig had people mistaking it for my real hair!</li>
      <li>So if you want this really great wig for a pretty good price, ORDER EARLY!</li>
      <li>but it can still be noticeable if someone stares closely but other than that its perfect :)</li>
      <li>other than that it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
      <li>Other that it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
      <li>Even after a friend of mine &amp;#34;borrowed&amp;#34; it and abused it a bit, I could easily brush out the tangles.</li>
      <li>I own 7 wigs, and I have to say that this is my absolute favorite.</li>
      <li>Easy to style, shape.</li>
      <li>The color was spot on and the overall quality was just great.</li>
      <li>and I had gotten a haircut), smooth, and manageable.</li>
      <li>The bangs don&#x27;t fall in your face, the hair is soft and shiny, and the length is good for pixie cuts.</li>
      <li>/&gt;i was pretty lucky that i was going to be wearing this wig with a hat over it for my Ness cosplay, the hat compliments it nicely.</li>
      <li>It was perfect in colour and style but when she put it on it was a bit small.</li>
      <li>I wanted to know if I look good in short hair or</li>
      <li>Looks is not bad.</li>
      <li>The wig was very nicely wrapped, but it took pretty long to get here.</li>
      <li>This is actually better quality than what I would normally get at a wig store.  </li>
      <li>My granddaugher has long a think curly have and has a Ciel wig the same length that fits perfectly.</li>
      <li>and i love it so far!</li>
      <li>It looks as cute as it does in the picture, and I felt more adorable than usual.</li>
      <li>It is shorter than the picture but the quality is good and the only problem i have is that there is a spot that its kinda bold not too much</li>
      <li>I bought this wig and fell in love instantly, The image is lightly styled.</li>
      <li>The straps to adjust it hang out if you don&#x27;t position them just right.</li>
      <li>It holds up well with time, can handle hair spray, and I can style it without damaging the hair very much.</li>
      <li>Looks exactly like the picture</li>
      <li>because of this the wig fits pretty close to my head instead of having any sort of volume like in the picture shown for the wig.</li>
      <li>if you have a slightly larger head than most or want a fuller wig that can be styled and played with, skip it.</li>
      <li>i got this wig in the mail today and immediately opened it, and the first thing i noticed when i pulled it out was that it was...small.</li>
      <li>and people even think its real!</li>
      <li>An added bonus is that it actually fits my head, which most wigs don&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>VERY realistic</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend it if you have short enough hair or can wrap your hair, other wise a longer wig is better for you.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s still a pretty decent wig though, it&#x27;s not shiny, and the texture is average.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I got the wig a whole week before the estimated arrival date even started!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(I even convinced my friends that it was my real hair</li>
      <li>but that doesnt matter too much</li>
      <li>My friend&#x27;s head is a bit bigger and she can&#x27;t fit it, so it&#x27;s not one size fits all.</li>
      <li>I like it too much.</li>
      <li>It was much, much.much longer than the picture shown here, probably 2 inches longer.  </li>
      <li>and I am sure I will use it in the near future</li>
      <li>Other than that the shipping was okay.</li>
      <li>I even wore it to my older brother&#x27;s graduation, with people under the impression it was real.</li>
      <li>It shipped in a decent amount of time, about two weeks, which is reasonable as it&#x27;s shipping from China to Texas.</li>
      <li>Casual or formal, this wig is simply wonderful and adds a soft, sheak look should you have the right facial structure.</li>
      <li>Also I wear this everyday and it looks so cute, people really think its my real hair and ask me where i get it done.</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend this wig to anyone cosplaying Jane, or anyone who just wants a cute, short hairdo.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;(P.S</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t wait to use it with my young justice robin costume! !</li>
      <li>It holds it&#x27;s styling and is really soft!</li>
      <li>I have short hair and it seems a little tight but feels great</li>
      <li>wig is shorter in the back than pictured, but not by much.</li>
      <li>This wig really is natural.</li>
      <li>It is so soft and looks just like the pictures here, as well.</li>
      <li>The only problem I had so far is that the wig is sorta small because of my long hair but other than that it is a very good wig</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s silky smooth like Asian hair and pretty thick.</li>
      <li>have long hair so its kind of hard to put my hair in the space inside the wig since the space is small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They were both brown, not black, brown.  </li>
      <li>(i have an average sized head for an american teenage girl) but the wig itself wasn&#x27;t very full.</li>
      <li>I will buy from this seller again as long as all their wigs are as high quality as the one I got!</li>
      <li>The wig itself is a little bit shorter than the one in the picture, but it&#x27;s totally worth buying it.</li>
      <li>although i barely got it today i already dont wanna take it off.</li>
      <li>No regrets.</li>
      <li>i mean, it definitely fit my head</li>
      <li>It was packaged nicely with a thin net to keep its shape, as well has an actual hair net.</li>
      <li>- The wig is so FULL and THICK.</li>
      <li>It also sheds a bit but only during the first few comb through.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> nice for a base wig and simple short hair cosplay characters (mainly boys) but sadly i ordered black and it came in brown. but that doesnt matter too much i still like it</li>
    <li> The wig was very nicely wrapped, but it took pretty long to get here. The wig is kind of shorter than the picture,  but very good quality:))&lt;br /&gt;I have long hair so its kind of hard to put my hair in the space inside the wig since the space is small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall,  I&#x27;m happy that its here and that I have it. I can&#x27;t wait to use it with my young justice robin costume! !</li>
    <li> I really do love it. I got it for my Jane cos-play ( Homestuck ) and it works like a charm. Looks exactly like the picture and people even think its real!</li>
    <li> I wanted to know if I look good in short hair or not so I bought this item and its amazing! The wig itself is a little bit shorter than the one in the picture, but it&#x27;s totally worth buying it. No regrets. The shipping came faster than I expected so that&#x27;s great news and the it&#x27;s made of quality materials. I totally recommend anyone this item.</li>
    <li> It is smaller than I expected. It is too tight for me. I wanted to have a little bigger one.  Looks is not bad. I like it. It is cute.</li>
    <li> I received this wig in a timely manner, but after a lot of styling and a lot of shedding, I finally achieved the style I want, but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for a cosplay (Jake English:HS) and when i got it, it was longer than stated in the picture and really weird. Although it still works for a wig. Other than that the shipping was okay.</li>
    <li> I got the wig a whole week before the estimated arrival date even started!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros - The wig is so FULL and THICK. This is actually better quality than what I would normally get at a wig store.  This is actually better quality than my 40 dollar wig, for 30 dollars cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons - it&#x27;s a little small, I have a small head so it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. It&#x27;s a little shorter than what I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very pleased with this wig! I will buy from this seller again as long as all their wigs are as high quality as the one I got!</li>
    <li> Great wig fits well, well made happy I purchased it. This wig is great quality for the price and I am sure I will use it in the near future</li>
    <li> I did read alot of comments of ppl saying thats its too tight cause of their long hair. I have short hair and it seems a little tight but feels great so yeah I understand that if my hair was longer it would be a problem. Also I wear this everyday and it looks so cute, people really think its my real hair and ask me where i get it done. They cant believe its a wig especially for like $7. One thing I hate is that alot of hair strands fall, washing, combing, or using my hands. But i understand...$7 wig. so imma wear it till i get tired or all the hair falls off lol</li>
    <li> I have no problems with the wig itself. VERY realistic (I even convinced my friends that it was my real hair and I had gotten a haircut), smooth, and manageable. It was packaged nicely with a thin net to keep its shape, as well has an actual hair net. However, it took one month and two days for the product to arrive, and although it was within the estimated delivery dates, it was a bit disappointing. So if you want this really great wig for a pretty good price, ORDER EARLY!</li>
    <li> I really love the cut and feel of this wig. It has a tint of brown to it though instead of solid black but it is dark enough for what i need it for. It also sheds a bit but only during the first few comb through. Other that it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> This wig is crap. When i got it the wefts started falling out and it reaked  :( what a waste of money</li>
    <li> As the quality of hair was good the wig itself would bald the more it was messed with and very quickly at that</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like it is in the picture the back is the a little shorter and you have to be careful for bumps. It a very good wig, nice quality very soft and shiny. Looking forward to using this wig!</li>
    <li> I bought this wig for a Jane cosplay, and I have to say I love it! The bangs don&#x27;t fall in your face, the hair is soft and shiny, and the length is good for pixie cuts. The color was spot on and the overall quality was just great. Even after a friend of mine &amp;#34;borrowed&amp;#34; it and abused it a bit, I could easily brush out the tangles.</li>
    <li> I bought this wig and fell in love instantly, The image is lightly styled. Personally I can&#x27;t take it off. I like it too much. Keep in mind it does make your head look a little bit.. Rounded I guess? Like a coconut (if you have a certain face shape it looks perfect)</li>
    <li> I own 7 wigs, and I have to say that this is my absolute favorite. It shipped in a decent amount of time, about two weeks, which is reasonable as it&#x27;s shipping from China to Texas. It is so soft and looks just like the pictures here, as well. An added bonus is that it actually fits my head, which most wigs don&#x27;t. I highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;(P.S, I bought it for Jane Crocker from Homestuck and I LOVE.)</li>
    <li> This wig really is natural. It was much, much.much longer than the picture shown here, probably 2 inches longer.  It needs some SERIOUS cutting and styling! It&#x27;s silky smooth like Asian hair and pretty thick. I like this wig better than the Izaya Durarara! black cosplay wig.</li>
    <li> I got this for Jake English cosplay.  It&#x27;s wonderful and soft and came with a free wig cap!  The only problem is that the hair falls out a bit and I&#x27;m worried it might fall apart later... other than that it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> Great length and texture</li>
    <li> Kinda small and I have a small head</li>
    <li> I bought this wig for my granddaughter and it was very soft and did not feel fake. It was perfect in colour and style but when she put it on it was a bit small. My granddaugher has long a think curly have and has a Ciel wig the same length that fits perfectly.</li>
    <li> you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> Horrible, horrible HORRIBLE!!! Do not even consider buying this.  I bought one for me, to be karkat, I was going to style it of course, and one for my friend to be john, also planned to style.  They were both brown, not black, brown.  And they were too short in the back AND the front.  and since I bought two I WASTED TWICE THE MONEY. I PLAN TO NEVER BUY FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN!!</li>
    <li> It fits my head rather snuggly, but people can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s a wig! My friend&#x27;s head is a bit bigger and she can&#x27;t fit it, so it&#x27;s not one size fits all. I had to trim the bangs a bit or go blind. I&#x27;d recommend it if you have short enough hair or can wrap your hair, other wise a longer wig is better for you. It looks as cute as it does in the picture, and I felt more adorable than usual. Again, many people can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s a wig.</li>
    <li> This wig was wonderfully crafted. It holds up well with time, can handle hair spray, and I can style it without damaging the hair very much. I even wore it to my older brother&#x27;s graduation, with people under the impression it was real. Casual or formal, this wig is simply wonderful and adds a soft, sheak look should you have the right facial structure.</li>
    <li> Wig has a nice shape and color very good for cosplay and Halloween. Cute cut and style, good for changing up your look.</li>
    <li> I love this wig! It is very comfortable to wear and is extremely easy to style! The only problem I had so far is that the wig is sorta small because of my long hair but other than that it is a very good wig and I can&#x27;t wait to use it for my Japan Cosplay! :D</li>
    <li> i got this wig in the mail today and immediately opened it, and the first thing i noticed when i pulled it out was that it was...small. i mean, it definitely fit my head (i have an average sized head for an american teenage girl) but the wig itself wasn&#x27;t very full. that&#x27;s not to say it was incredibly thin, it just didn&#x27;t have as much hair as would normally be expected. because of this the wig fits pretty close to my head instead of having any sort of volume like in the picture shown for the wig. it&#x27;s still a pretty decent wig though, it&#x27;s not shiny, and the texture is average.&lt;br /&gt;i was pretty lucky that i was going to be wearing this wig with a hat over it for my Ness cosplay, the hat compliments it nicely. but this is probably the only cosplay i can use this wig on. if you&#x27;re looking to cosplay say, John Egbert, then this probably isn&#x27;t for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tl;dr if you have a slightly larger head than most or want a fuller wig that can be styled and played with, skip it.</li>
    <li> I loved the wig! It is perfect for my John cosplay from homestuck. It holds it&#x27;s styling and is really soft!</li>
    <li> Im using this for a catwoman cosplay and i love it so far!</li>
    <li> i love this wig! although i barely got it today i already dont wanna take it off. It is shorter than the picture but the quality is good and the only problem i have is that there is a spot that its kinda bold not too much but it can still be noticeable if someone stares closely but other than that its perfect :)</li>
    <li> So I ordered this wig and arriving to me yesterday my wig was WAY to short. The hair in the back goes to the bottom of my ear where in the picture the hair goes down the neck. The hair on the sides doesn&#x27;t even go past my ears. I&#x27;m very unhappy with the product I got and on the wig I noticed scissor cuts, I think mine was used beforehand.</li>
    <li> Wig came down past my chin. I was hoping this already came styled, like the other reviews. I had to cut it myself, which just made it worse, and had to throw it away.</li>
    <li> its a very nice wig, i feel comfortable in it. i cant wait to use it for my Jane Crocker cosplay ^_^</li>
    <li> Easy to style, shape. The color is beautiful. You do have to be a little careful if you brush with a comb. A few of the hairs came off if you don&#x27;t comb gently. It arrived in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> I bought this wig for my Jane Crocker (Homestuck) cosplay. The wig arrived nicely packaged and with a wig cap [the cap even showed instructions as to how to put it on]. It has a small tag so that you can tell the back from the front (Trust me, without it, it was almost impossible to tell.)&lt;br /&gt;The wig is shorter in the back than pictured, but not by much. The straps to adjust it hang out if you don&#x27;t position them just right. It also sheds quite a bit, but for the price, it is a very good quality wig. I would definitely recommend this wig to anyone cosplaying Jane, or anyone who just wants a cute, short hairdo.</li>
    <li> Nothing like pic....waste of money</li>
    <li> The netting shows in the back, and the whole thing is somewhat small-- and lemme say! This is super hard to style! However, the volume and surprising quality of this wig had people mistaking it for my real hair! I recommend this to any cosplayer on a budget.</li>
