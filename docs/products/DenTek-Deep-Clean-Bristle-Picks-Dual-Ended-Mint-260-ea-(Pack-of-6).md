### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This means this may not be the greatest thing ever to have bouncing around in the bottom of your purse, though I have done it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an excellent product,</li>
      <li>Great picks but a year ago</li>
      <li>If my dentist is happy, then I&#x27;m happy.</li>
      <li>My wife thinks they are great.  </li>
      <li>My dentist is very happy with this addiction :-)</li>
      <li>These are great picks and really nice that they are in a plastic container with a hole to shake out just one pick at a time.  </li>
      <li>Good product, nice dispenser package.</li>
      <li>They are very effective as my gums are always healthy.</li>
      <li>They work great to clean my teeth.</li>
      <li>A toothpick would be more effective and not break in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The DenTek brand takes about a dozen picks or more</li>
      <li>I think they are OK, but like my brand better.  </li>
      <li>I see clients during the day and want to be sure I don&#x27;t have leftover bits of salad stuck between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love these, they work well.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t imagine why they would have changed a very useful product into this.</li>
      <li>I bought my first pack of DenTek a couple of months ago and loved them so much I decided to purchase the pack of six.  </li>
      <li>the quality was not at all like my original purchase.  </li>
      <li>However, I recently found The Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks and they are even better than the original Dentek ones that I was trying to replace.</li>
      <li>My excitement when I received them quickly faded when I used the first pick...</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a six pack, so I figure this package will last me until the end of time... which is a good thing, as I can no longer find these for sale in the store near me.</li>
      <li>The only difference that I can see is the cute, plastic dispenser.</li>
      <li>I thought these were a repackaging for a product I had used for a long time and was no longer available, so I was excited to find them.</li>
      <li>They are very soft and flimsy, just barely useful.  </li>
      <li>They cost a little more, but they are worth it.  </li>
      <li>can only clean really soft stuff.</li>
      <li>The Doctor&#x27;s brand is much more heavy duty.</li>
      <li>A must have to survive adult braces!</li>
      <li>A rip-off from a company that is apparently only interested in keeping their profits high as a result of their manipulating (must order on-line in large quantity) and gouging (price is higher than former better quality product)</li>
      <li>/&gt;Another reviewer said these were too soft, but I didn&#x27;t have that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>tooo soft</li>
      <li>The ones in the blue boxes are much firmer plastic and a bit narrower.  </li>
      <li>there not really firm enough for me, too flexible.</li>
      <li>like the little brushy end, it makes me feel like I am really getting the gunk between my teeth after lunch, which is the biggest time I use these.  </li>

    <li> I thought these were a repackaging for a product I had used for a long time and was no longer available, so I was excited to find them. I stupidly (as it turns out) bought this multi-package and didn&#x27;t open it until the ones I had ran out. Now it is too late to return. So just let me tell you that there is essentially no bristle and the smooth other end is useless. I can&#x27;t imagine why they would have changed a very useful product into this. I am completely disappointed. However, I recently found The Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks and they are even better than the original Dentek ones that I was trying to replace. I will just have to chalk it up and throw these away. Bummer.</li>
    <li> It is like they intentionally made the brush end a thin diameter so it would quickly fail upon use. The Doctor&#x27;s brand is much more heavy duty. I can usually floss all of my teeth with one or two picks of the Doctor&#x27;s brand. The DenTek brand takes about a dozen picks or more and there is still places than I cannot floss due to pick fail.</li>
    <li> My local  Walmart was out of these, so I ordered them from Amazon.  They cost a little more, but they are worth it.  It&#x27;s an excellent product,</li>
    <li> Good product, nice dispenser package.</li>
    <li> A dentist friend recommended these picks - one end is pick and other end has small brush.  They are very effective as my gums are always healthy.</li>
    <li> I bought my first pack of DenTek a couple of months ago and loved them so much I decided to purchase the pack of six.  My excitement when I received them quickly faded when I used the first pick...the quality was not at all like my original purchase.  These are flimsy, quickly loose there shape and don&#x27;t clean those hard to reach areas as expected. Bummer as I now have a 3-4 year supply of not up to par picks.</li>
    <li> The dental picks arrived as pictured.  They work great to clean my teeth.</li>
    <li> there not really firm enough for me, too flexible. can only clean really soft stuff. if you get something stuck between your teeth, there useless.</li>
    <li> A must have to survive adult braces!</li>
    <li> My wife thinks they are great.  I think they are OK, but like my brand better.  The only thing:  the Prime order got us enough picks to last for the next 10 years.....</li>
    <li> Been using these for 24 mos now, and I&#x27;ve had 4 seller checkups with my dentist.  There are 2 versions of this pick - green and blue boxes.  The ones in the green boxes (preferred) are made of softer plastic and are a bit thicker.  The ones in the blue boxes are much firmer plastic and a bit narrower.  I use these after every meal; they work well, and my dentist couldn&#x27;t be happier.  If my dentist is happy, then I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Great picks but a year ago I but 250 picks for $3.50 at Target. The only difference that I can see is the cute, plastic dispenser. Not worth buying anymore.</li>
    <li> Dreadful. A toothpick would be more effective and not break in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have made these too flimsy to be of any value.</li>
    <li> Have used this product in the past when I could buy it in a local store.  I was not happy about having to order on line because of the quantity I was forced to order.  I am sad to report, but not surprised, that the quality of these picks is not nearly as good as the previous packages that came from a local store. They are very soft and flimsy, just barely useful.  A rip-off from a company that is apparently only interested in keeping their profits high as a result of their manipulating (must order on-line in large quantity) and gouging (price is higher than former better quality product) customers.</li>
    <li> Painful, horrible, little evil things. These are the worst.</li>
    <li> These are great picks and really nice that they are in a plastic container with a hole to shake out just one pick at a time.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Not easy to use. tooo soft</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hooked on these things.  I was disappointed when I couldn&#x27;t find them in the store then found them on Amazon!!  My dentist is very happy with this addiction :-)</li>
    <li> The bristles are virtually non-existent, which makes these just hard plastic toothpicks.  Returning them.</li>
    <li> I love these, they work well.  The dispenser they come in is convenient too.  Be away the little container has a small hole in the lid so you can shake one out.  (Well, in practice, about three poke out, but you just snag one.)  This means this may not be the greatest thing ever to have bouncing around in the bottom of your purse, though I have done it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the little brushy end, it makes me feel like I am really getting the gunk between my teeth after lunch, which is the biggest time I use these.  I see clients during the day and want to be sure I don&#x27;t have leftover bits of salad stuck between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer said these were too soft, but I didn&#x27;t have that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a six pack, so I figure this package will last me until the end of time... which is a good thing, as I can no longer find these for sale in the store near me.</li>
